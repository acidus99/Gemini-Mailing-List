<PRE>&gt;<i> Personally, what I would most like to see in a client is a large subset
</I>&gt;<i> of Markdown (no embedded HTML, probably no inline images). But all of
</I>&gt;<i> the CommonMark text properties, levels of headings, etc. In general, I
</I>&gt;<i> would like for reasonable typography to be what you think of when you
</I>&gt;<i> think of a Gemini page. I understand that this makes things
</I>&gt;<i> significantly harder for client implementors.
</I>
I too would be very happy if Gemini developed a reputation for nice,
functional typography.  None of the features you propose strike me as
problematic.  I especially like the levels of headings idea.  Not just
for the visual aspect, but because it allows, like the Markdown browser
you shared a link to, a nice navigational sidebar for large structured
documents, which is very much a good thing.

&gt;<i> That's one reason why I've suggested ratfactor's Text Junior format (can
</I>&gt;<i> someone invite ratfactor? I don't have any means of contacting them) as
</I>&gt;<i> a standard format for Gemini. It is basically a large subset of
</I>&gt;<i> Markdown, but fully line-oriented and stripped of parsing ambiguities. A
</I>&gt;<i> simple client can either just cat(1) it, can fmt(1) everything that's
</I>&gt;<i> not wrapped in a ``` ``` block, or can apply full formatting. Everything
</I>&gt;<i> I have served on my Gemini site is legal Text Junior.
</I>
Text Junior seems nice and I'm not opposed to using it or something very
similar to it as a basis for Gemini.  But the current worst shortcoming,
IMHO, of the very minimal &quot;yeah, you can reflow stuff if you like&quot;
Gemini spec is that it wrecks nicely formatted lists, and as far as I can
see TJ doesn't currently handle that either.
