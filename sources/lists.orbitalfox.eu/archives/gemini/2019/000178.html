<PRE>Currently, the &quot;speculative specification&quot; has the following to say
about how Gemini clients should validate TLS certificates when
connecting to servers:

&gt;<i> Clients can validate TLS connections however they like (including not
</I>&gt;<i> at all) but the strongly RECOMMENDED approach is to implement a
</I>&gt;<i> lightweight &quot;TOFU&quot; certificate-pinning system which treats self-signed
</I>&gt;<i> certificates as first- class citizens.
</I>
Well, there's a *little* more detail than that, but not much.

To the best of my knowledge, all extant clients take the &quot;not at all&quot;
route.  I'm looking to change this for the case of AV-98 and so wanted
to start thinking a little more clearly about what the different
possibilities are for making TLS as secure as possible without relying
on certificate authorities.

Before even starting to talk about this, it makes sense to at least
vaguely specify a threat model.  I don't think it's realistic to aim at
Gemini being resilient against targetted attacks from state-level
actors, and given the likely total lack of commercial content on Gemini
in the forseeable future I think cybercriminals are not yet a realistic
concern.  To my mind the most important things to consider are:

 * ISPs logging all Gemini traffic
 * ISPs altering Gemini traffic (e.g. to insert adverts)
 * ISPs terminating connections when blacklisted keywords are seen, to
   facilitate government-mandated censorship

All of these things do happen right now or have happened previously in
the context of the web, so they're not ridiculous to consider.  None of
these things are targetted, in the sense that they are most probably
done to *all* traffic on a given set of ports using automated systems,
without any special case-by-case consideration.  This means that
effective countermeasures don't necessarily need to be things that
couldn't be defeated by a smart person with a little effort, they just
need to be not so trivially defeated that the attack can be easily and
reliably automated.

Right now, all use of TLS for Gemini *can* be easily and reliably
automated because there's nothing to prevent MITM attacks.

At the very least, it seems sensible for a client to insist that a
certificate's &quot;Not Before&quot; and &quot;Not After&quot; validity dates agree with the
current date, and that the hostname the client is trying to connect to
is consistent with either the certificate's Common Name or Subject
Alternative Names.  This only prevents extremely stupid MITM attacks
which try to use a generic bogus certificate to attack all connections,
but it's relatively straightforward to do and raises the bar slightly,
so why not recommend it?

Onto more serious attempts at preventing MITM: I've always thought that
a TOFU style approach would work well for this, but before digging into
this more I'll quickly metion something else I read about today which
could be a great tool for Gemini - I don't discuss it before TOFU here
because I think it's better than TOFU, I do it because I think it can be
described quickly and easily and doesn't raise as many implementation
questions.

DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE, see
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities</A>)
basically involves using DNS records to let domain owners declare
certain things about which certificates should be considered valid for
their hostnames, and one thing a DANE record can declare is that
&quot;exactly this verbatim certificate should be used and none other&quot;.  This
means that a successful MITM attack also requires a successful attack on
the user's DNS system - which of course is not impossible, but it raises
the bar substantially.  I think DANE could be part of a good
security-in-depth design.

Anyway, onto the TOFU.

The basic TOFU model involves blindly trusting a certificate the first
time you encounter it, but *remembering* that certificate (or rather,
just its fingerprint, basically a hash digest) and warning the user if a
different certficiate is encountered in the future.  In principle this
approach means that a MITM attack can only be pulled off the first time
a user connects to a particular host.  Which, now that I think about it,
actually offers much better defence against targetted attacks than the
automated dragnet stuff that is supposed to be part of Gemini's threat
model - a TOFU client which only ever accesses Geminispace from the same
home internet connection through the same ISP is vulnerable to bulk MITM
attacks.  Hrmh.

The TOFU model sounds simple enough but questions appear once you start
actually trying to code it.  The first one I had was whether or not
certificates should be &quot;remembered&quot; against IP addresses or hostnames.
This question is pertinent because Gemini's use of URLs instead of
selectors as requests enables name-based virtual hosting, so it's
possible for one IP address to map to multiple hostnames.

It turns out that most TLS implementations (including even the Python
standard library's ssl module, which I've started to take a dim view of)
support a TLS extension called Server Name Indication (SNI) where the
client sends the hostname of the server it think it's connecting to as
part of the TLS handshake.  This allows virtual hosting servers to serve
up distinct certificates for distinct hostnames.  This is a good thing
because it allows shared hosting where each user can take responsibility
for their own certificates.  I am thinking of amending the Gemini spec
to say that clients SHOULD use SNI.

The end result of this is that TOFU clients should store certificate
fingerprints against hostnames, not IP addresses.  So, there's that
question solved and I'll code this up for AV-98 soon.

The next question is what to do about certificate expiration.  The first
time a client connects to a host after that host's previously seen
certificate has expired, the client EXPECTS to see something new.  If it
simply blindly trusts the first new thing which comes along, this
basically means that a client is periodically vulnerable to MITMs at
certain times - times which are publically announced far in advance!  A
very simple way to partially mitigate this problem might be to recommend
that Gemini certificates be relatively long lived - although this is a
trade-off because it means the damage from a compromised certificate
lasts longer.  A much better solution is some sort of scheme where
servers sign their new certificates using the key associated with their
old certificate, authenticating the continuity - this is really
beautiful, but it would require server admins to use a specialised
certificate genreating tool, which feels unlikely to take off.

There are various more complicated schemes people have proposed to make
TLS work without CAs, like the idea of &quot;public notary&quot; servers.  I'm
very interested in exploring these possibilities for Gemini.  Probably
any such system would be a recommendation only for especially
security-conscious clients, with vanilla TOFU being the more common
baseline.

Thoughts very welcome!

Cheers,
Solderpunk
