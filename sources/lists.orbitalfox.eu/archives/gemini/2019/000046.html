<PRE>I have changed the subject, but this is a continuation of the text reflow convo...
but the conversation has drifted and I felt a new subject was in order.

</I>
I agree with Sean that the lack of a standard is an issue. Additionally, most
versions of markdown allow for embedded html as well as inline images. I
believe the majority of us were against these things. In additional to 
philosophical disagreements there are issues, as Sean also writes, with
the mandate that a simple client should be buildable as a weekend project.

Having said the things above, I like markdown. I think it is a good fit for what
we have been floating around with this project on the whole. I think it has a lot
of strengths. Given the issues above (coding-effort-wise and philosophy-wise)
it feels like the only way to make things work is to define a dialect of markdown
as a standard that is a part of the gemini spec (though it could have its own
spec as well and just reference that in the gemini spec). 

If that route were chosen, I think we would need to create parsers that return 
an AST in a variety of languages and make the libraries available to developers 
to use in their gemini projects. This would be a pretty big undertaking and I do not
know that it is exactly in scope. But we do seem to keep coming back to
markdown as a good option that pretty much everyone likes at least some
elements of.

I'm very open to other suggestions and look forward to hearing other paths
forward.
