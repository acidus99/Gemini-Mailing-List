I'm trying to be cautious and avoid jumping to a snap decision, but:
wow!  I think I'm more enthused about this idea than anything else which
has been proposed.  It's wonderfully simple, even more so than the idea
which was brought up much earlier about using spaces at the *end* of the
line.  It is also vaguely compatible with some flavours of Markdown,
where code blocks are indicated with four leading spaces - Markdown
documents formatted in this way would be (in that respect) correctly
rendered by Gemini clients implementing this proposal.  Bulletted lists
arguably look even nicer when formatted with a leading space:

 * The first item
 * A second item
 * Item the third

I acknowledge that this solution is not perfect and e.g. won't gracefully
handle bulleted lists with items which are more than one line long (not
sure how big a problem this is in practice - the longer each list item
gets, the more perfectly fine the whole list looks, IMHO, if each line
is formatted as a paragraph of its own), but I think by now it should be
obvious that there is no hope of achieving a perfect solution covering
all situations while still keeping the implementation effort very low.
This proposal gets us an awful lot of bang for the buck.  For use cases
where it just won't cut the mustard, it might be time to consider
serving text/markdown over Gemini or, heck, even text/html over HTTP via
Shizaru or a similarly non-evil server.  Gemini won't - can't - be the
ideal tool for every job.

It might be a good idea for people to start experimenting with
implementing this, so we can get an informed perspective on just how
hard to implement this *really* is, and on how certain kinds of content
renders.
