&gt;<i> I never did something like this (I usually just use git or rsync to 
</I>&gt;<i> publish) but maybe syncthing[0] is an option too.
</I>
Yeah, we have been using syncthing for other purposes, but then there is 
still the question of what would be a simple text editor, optimally with 
syntax highlighting, that she could use.


&gt;<i> Nextcloud could be an option too, but it seems to require more effort. 
</I>&gt;<i> IIRC you can edit also plain text files with the built-in editor, but 
</I>&gt;<i> it won't do syntax highlighting and you have to find a solution for the 
</I>&gt;<i> publishing part.
</I>
Unfortunately .gmi is not recognized as plain text :/
I was considering webdav to get the files out, but that also seems 
unnecessarily complicated. I suppose local editing with sync is a better 
idea unless there is a different server-based option thats better.

Thanks for the input though :)

Best,
Unicorn
