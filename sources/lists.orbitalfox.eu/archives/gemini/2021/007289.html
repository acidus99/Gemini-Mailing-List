</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is it still a problem? :D

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Sometimes I've left dangling questions like this hoping for Bortzmeyer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to chime in and share some stats.  In the past it worked, hope he share
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some this time too ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;50.4&#160;% of URLs do NOT send a proper TLS shutdown (application
</I>&gt;<i> close). Even 36.8&#160;% of those who return status 20 are in that case.&quot;
</I>
It's worst than what I thought!  We know what software this servers are
using?

Thanks for chiming in and also for sharing the excerpt about
close_notify :)

&gt;<i> The future RFC on HTTP (completely rewritten and reorganised) has a
</I>&gt;<i> nice explanation:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 9.8.  TLS Connection Closure
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    TLS uses an exchange of closure alerts prior to (non-error)
</I>&gt;<i>    connection closure to provide secure connection closure; see
</I>&gt;<i>    Section 6.1 of [TLS13].  When a valid closure alert is received, an
</I>&gt;<i>    implementation can be assured that no further data will be received
</I>&gt;<i>    on that connection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    When an implementation knows that it has sent or received all the
</I>&gt;<i>    message data that it cares about, typically by detecting HTTP message
</I>&gt;<i>    boundaries, it might generate an &quot;incomplete close&quot; by sending a
</I>&gt;<i>    closure alert and then closing the connection without waiting to
</I>&gt;<i>    receive the corresponding closure alert from its peer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    An incomplete close does not call into question the security of the
</I>&gt;<i>    data already received, but it could indicate that subsequent data
</I>&gt;<i>    might have been truncated.  As TLS is not directly aware of HTTP
</I>&gt;<i>    message framing, it is necessary to examine the HTTP data itself to
</I>&gt;<i>    determine whether messages were complete.  Handling of incomplete
</I>&gt;<i>    messages is defined in Section 8.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    When encountering an incomplete close, a client SHOULD treat as
</I>&gt;<i>    completed all requests for which it has received as much data as
</I>&gt;<i>    specified in the Content-Length header or, when a Transfer-Encoding
</I>&gt;<i>    of chunked is used, for which the terminal zero-length chunk has been
</I>&gt;<i>    received.  A response that has neither chunked transfer coding nor
</I>&gt;<i>    Content-Length is complete only if a valid closure alert has been
</I>&gt;<i>    received.  Treating an incomplete message as complete could expose
</I>&gt;<i>    implementations to attack.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    A client detecting an incomplete close SHOULD recover gracefully.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Clients MUST send a closure alert before closing the connection.
</I>&gt;<i>    Clients that do not expect to receive any more data MAY choose not to
</I>&gt;<i>    wait for the server's closure alert and simply close the connection,
</I>&gt;<i>    thus generating an incomplete close on the server side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Servers SHOULD be prepared to receive an incomplete close from the
</I>&gt;<i>    client, since the client can often determine when the end of server
</I>&gt;<i>    data is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Servers MUST attempt to initiate an exchange of closure alerts with
</I>&gt;<i>    the client before closing the connection.  Servers MAY close the
</I>&gt;<i>    connection after sending the closure alert, thus generating an
</I>&gt;<i>    incomplete close on the client side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And also:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 11.3.  Message Integrity
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>    Care is needed however to ensure that connection closure
</I>&gt;<i>    cannot be used to truncate messages (see Section 9.8).  User agents
</I>&gt;<i>    might refuse to accept incomplete messages or treat them specially.
</I>&gt;<i>    For example, a browser being used to view medical history or drug
</I>&gt;<i>    interaction information needs to indicate to the user when such
</I>&gt;<i>    information is detected by the protocol to be incomplete, expired, or
</I>&gt;<i>    corrupted during transfer.  Such mechanisms might be selectively
</I>&gt;<i>    enabled via user agent extensions or the presence of message
</I>&gt;<i>    integrity metadata in a response.
</I>&gt;<i>
