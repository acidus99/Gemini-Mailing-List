<PRE>&gt;<i> With all due respect, I do not believe that you can realistically call
</I>yourself the dictator of the project. At most you can claim to rule this
mailing list, which per axiom &#8470;2 is only a minority of the actual
community. While I respect your role in the creation of the protocol
(i.e., the whole of the original design), Gemini has grown larger than
what a single BDFL can control.

This is solderpunk's project. Always has been. He's the one who
appointed Sean to tackle fine-tuning the spec. He is the canonical voice
in the protocol. This has in no way grown larger than what a single BDFL
can do. There are plenty of much more massive projects run by a single
BDFL, including ones where that leader has gone quiet for years.

Put simply, until such time as solderpunk decides to hand control to
another maintainer or maintainers, this is his.

If you require more practical terms, he's never licensed it. It's his.
Sean recently threw a CC0 on the working-draft on Gitlab, but that's not
canonical to begin with.

On a personal note, I'm really glad he's back. I'm hoping with the
conclusion of these changes we can just shut down this mailing list
completely. It's the least Gemini thing about Gemini.

</PRE>
