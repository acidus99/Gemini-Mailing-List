I agree that this syntax makes sense and is easy to read: as you say, it
degrades to plain text nicely, so there is no pressure to do anything in
particular with it.  However, it makes the information available to search
engines in such a way that it is possible to find documents.

VERY IMPORTANT:  I do *not* think that this convention needs to be part of
the text/gemini spec, because understanding it is not a requirement for
clients.  One client (for human use) can render an =: line as an ordinary
gemtext line; another client can ignore such lines; a smarter client can
render them but translate &quot;language en&quot; into &quot;English language&quot; and &quot;format
text/html&quot; into &quot;HTML&quot;.

Search engines and other metadata processors have the same three choices.
A simple approach to making use of metadata  is to treat &quot;creator Crowder,
Mary&quot; in the index as if it were &quot;creator:Crowder creator:Mary&quot;, thus
allowing people to search for these things Google-style, without confusing
them with subject:Crowder.

Here's some lines in the above format for characterizing one of Project
Gutenberg's books.  This is an extensive example:  I do not mean that
typical metadata creators will use anything this complex.

=: pgterms.ebook 22222
=: creator Crowther, Mary Owens
=: language en
=: subject Etiquette
=: type Text
=: title How to Write Letters (Formerly The Book of Letters) A Complete
Guide to Correct Business and Personal Correspondence

 Note that some metadata lines are actually links to other formats of this
book, so a metadata-aware processor would look at links and see that after
the URL there is an &quot;=:&quot; and process it as metadata.  For this reason, I do
not think that metadata lines should be required to be in a fixed place in
the document: I have put the links at the end because they are most likely
less important to people than the rest of the metadata.

In addition, &quot;=:&quot; lines can be joined together if they are related, with a
second &quot;=:&quot; on the same line, since that is unlikely to be part of the
value.  This provides the benefit of structured metadata with a depth of 1.

Note to Lars and other metadata people:  I have simplified
&quot;dcterms.creator&quot; to &quot;creator&quot; and &quot;dcterms.subject.LCSH&quot; to &quot;subject&quot;, so
as not to be too scary-looking.  I have also omitted some of the available
formats of this particular book.
