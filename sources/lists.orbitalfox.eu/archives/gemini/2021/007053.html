<PRE>Hi Alan,

Thanks for that concern.

One of my challenges as a presenter are that many of Gemini's justifications are already clearly provided in a succinct way (The protocol even states its not a replacement nor HTTP)- I want to be creative without repeating others (though Id make an excellent text to speech bot...)

For me visualising these concepts (and providing the coding for reuse) would be helpful, in order to build on the concept(s) would be a win if the talk bombs.

I enjoy using analogies and consider the 'Gemini spacecraft' one to be an excellent (though I consider it to represent the 'software', rather than the 'freedom' aspect more perfectly). 

I am keen to suggest a freedom analogy on terms of the Retford pilgrims who made it across the Atlantic (on the Mayflower) - 

Here goes a rough concept:

Why did they go with less?: Previously, vistors of the American shores were usually a consequence of serendipity, privateers and plunderers. Many sailors were Zuckerberg'd onto ships, having been plied with drink the night before. The bureaucratic reach of two distance dioceses started applying pressure on them to conform - they chose risk, toil and suffering - all for what, freedom?

*Ducks a tomato*

[Now, I could also trail off into things like the Diet of Worms, the Luddites, et al but Im not so sure they are worth birthing]

Personally, I dont considered furrowed brows or indignation a problem, provided I put in enough effort to allow people to reflect.

Thanks
