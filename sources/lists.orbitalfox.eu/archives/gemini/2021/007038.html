I know this is not very progressive to say it, but why does it need to
scale? Why does everything always have to appeal to everyone?
Not to mention the well-discussed issue as to whether content *needs* to be
updated through a browser. My stance on this is pretty much: you have to
learn things to use things. And using sftp to upload a file as a bare
minimum requirement is not hard. And it uses a protocol made for file
transfer! You can even transport images with it! &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

In all seriousness, there are multiple real life examples of this. If you
want to learn to drive a car you need to consider learning how to drive.
Who'd think that just because you know how to ride a bike, someone tailors
your car to work like a bike, you know?

geminispace provides a nice retreat from the complexities of the clearweb
and it also makes you get back to tools that were around before everyone
decided that literally everything needs to live in a browser. It doesn't
mean that it's uncomfortable to use, but as skyjake once put it on <A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A>
station.martinrue.com: there's a reason text editors are there, because
text editing is hard. Adding that to a browser is tough. If you make
<A HREF="titan://">titan://</A> mandatory in geminispace, most browsers will instead to turn to
the shell where you have immediate access to nano, vim and emacs, and what
have you gained then?

I know I am ranting. But it's been discussed. geminispace is feature
complete from a protocol end. And if it doesn't grow big, that's probably
ok. Because the people that are in geminispace are great as it is :)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Titan protocol is a good step in the process and perhaps is the only
</I>&gt;<i> required step.  I am not sure.  We have to remember about need to
</I>&gt;<i> support multiple screen types from desktop to mobile and it is tough to
</I>&gt;<i> create something acceptable and generic for user input under the
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions Gemini protocol put in place.  I am hoping people here come
</I>&gt;<i> up with something :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also would like to raise people's awareness, that if the network to
</I>&gt;<i> grow and get any close to big, people shall expect that network would
</I>&gt;<i> promote payments models, because it kills advertisements so
</I>&gt;<i> efficiently.  I think it is a good thing.  I want to consume a product
</I>&gt;<i> and not to be a product.  If I am a product, then UI tends to focus on
</I>&gt;<i> makings adds prominent and waiting my time. That goes back to value of
</I>&gt;<i> Gemini and consequence of its proposition is non-add based models.  I hope.
