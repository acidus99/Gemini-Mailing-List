almeamber, I understand your reaction to freezing the spec, but please
at least take the time to check your facts before trashing someone.
Solderpunk has written at least AV-98 (client) and molly-brown (server).
He's not just some guy with a site and capsule; he's the person who
created the spec and who still has ultimate control over it. The
canonical Gemini specification is at
&lt;gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.gmi&gt;, and Solderpunk is the
only one with write-access to
&lt;gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.gmi&gt;.

&gt;<i> He can do whatever he wants with his
</I>&gt;<i> website, but for the rest, let the community decide. And the community
</I>&gt;<i> has pretty much settled on the original spec, so...
</I>
The community has pretty much settled on the original spec because the
original spec has pretty much settled (due to Solderpunk's absence).
Neither are fully settled, and the community can resettle upon a mostly-
same, updated spec.

&gt;<i> The difference to other standards is that we have no versions. When

</I>
The difference with other standards is that they are standards.
Currently, Gemini has only been specified - it has not be standardized.
Right now, Gemini is non-standard. We don't have to worry about
retroactively changing things because nothing is formalized; the
specification is not yet set in stone. We need to finish the spec before
we can worry about changing things.
