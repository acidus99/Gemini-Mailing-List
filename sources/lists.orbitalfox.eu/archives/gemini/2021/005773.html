I believe what you were looking for can be found here:

<A HREF="https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?&amp;page=35">https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?&amp;page=35</A>

It is however, of little import IMO, and I'm doubtful any Tivoli servers
are still out there. We had some of that stuff at Filenet when IBM
bought us, basically their vision of LDAP, which was and would be
contained within the confines of an Intranet anyway, certainly, not
something that would be sharing machinery with Gemini servers lol.

BTW, not a lot of folks realize this, but just like Mark Twain was to
Samuel Clemens, IANA was pretty much just a nom de guerre of Jon Postel
prior to his passing. One guy working out of a single office. ICANN made
it an actual body that now either serves, or is served by that
bureaucracy. Ergo, my fav RFC of all time:

<A HREF="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2468">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2468</A>

Jon also wrested control of our DNS back from the Government about a
year before he died. Yup! The same Government that's trying to steal it
again. It all started with what we call the MoU, and if you're
interested there's really good coverage of it in Ellen Rony's 'The
Domain Name Handbook'.

So don't forget people, it's private property (the Internet, that is -
all that copper, fiber, and all those 'Cisco' and Big Iron routers), not
public property. Right to pass revocable by owner at anytime. The
Government has no Right of way, and as far as imminent domain goes, I'm
not sure if the fiber or the racks qualify as real estate.

And with that, I'm def going to turn in for the evening and grab a few
hours of shuteye. I'm rambling on about things that died in the 90's.

I hope that helps :)

Kindest regards,
