In <A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/003299.html">https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/003299.html</A> an idea 
was that servers track client referers to present those referers to the 
next visitors, but we do not have referers for very good reasons.

Sketching out the idea nevertheless ... 
* Interesting post b on server :b
* Triggers person C to post her thoughts c on server :c with a link to b
* Poster C visits post b via her own link from post c to post b
* Server :b logs this referer, ie the URL of post c
* On following visits of post b, server :b lists the logged referers 
* Server :b could pre-fetch refering content to check for appropriate
  content, eg containing &quot;## Re: &quot; or &quot;=&gt; [own URL]&quot;

Alternatively webrings were proposed, which does seem like the correct 
Gemini way of doing it, though.
