<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Mansfield once stated:
&gt;<i> I've been 'thus said'ed!! :-D Thank you.
</I>
  You're welcome.

  If you are talking about this link:

	<A HREF="gemini://gemini.conman.org/conman-labs-private/">gemini://gemini.conman.org/conman-labs-private/</A>

then no one has ever asked for access.  So in that sense, yes, I've been
able to keep up with the subscription rate.  It was more of a way for me to
test client certificates than anything else.

</I>&gt;<i> The link worked fine for me and I'm not a member. Interesting that there

  Cool.  So you can get an idea for how that works then.
