Second this, mostly.  Personally I favour being approachable and
charitable over outreach and active recruitment, especially for
something like Gemini.  If we have great documentation, if we do not
welcome toxicity, and if we keep things simple, people that share the
mindset will be drawn in.

Of course we should be explaining Gemini to people and strive to make
this space a diverse, lively, interesting one, but IMHO we shouldn't do
that with a mathematical/economical/religious `growth' mindset.  It's
annoying to people and it seldom leads to serene and cohesive
communities.

I like how I discovered and joined fediverse: mastodon.sdf.org became
a thing, and I made an account around 2017.  Two years later, after
having totally forgotten about it, I noticed many cool people were on
Mastodon, so I joined.  I haven't regretted the decision since.  I've
also went in after a decent amount of learning how the community works.
If I was instead compelled to joining when I had no interest in nor any
knowledge of the community, I'd inevitably enjoy it less and be a less
cooperative member thereof.

Same kinda happened with Gemini.  I heard of it pretty early on in its
development but it was uninteresting.  A new protocol? :/  But as I saw
cool people I know join in, I looked in deeper, and learned what I can,
and joined in as a self motivated member that knows most of the basics
and that is eager to participate constructively.

That's of course all my experience and my 2&#162;.

    -gk.

P.S: I never really introduced myself to the list, dunno if that's
something you do here.  In any case my capsule is at
<A HREF="gemini://cadadr.space;">gemini://cadadr.space;</A> it's been about two months or something that it's
been up.  I have two gemlogs, one a generic blog, another a grad school
journal.  I may add a podcast in a few weeks--months.  Also, I've a repo
on github, <A HREF="https://github.com/cadadr/gemini-scripts,">https://github.com/cadadr/gemini-scripts,</A> that will slowly
accrue some random scripts regarding Gemini (unsurprisingly ;P).
