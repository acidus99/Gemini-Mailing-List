Hi Kevin

Thanks for the feedback. I have a couple of thoughts inline.

&gt;<i> This release made me uninstall the previous version (I skipped on at 
</I>&gt;<i> least one prior release, but I'm now not sure what version I was on), 
</I>&gt;<i> and then required me to install a new version of the .NET runtime from 
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft. I now get the following error when accessing any site:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Authentication failed, see inner exception.
</I>
It sounds like the .NET TLS authentication failed for some reason. 
Strange that you get it on every site, which suggests its not to do with 
any particular server.

&gt;<i> I wonder if this relates to running the bundled exe that does the Gemini 
</I>&gt;<i> fetch? I'm running Windows 7. 
</I>
Since 0.8.9, GemiNaut uses as native .NET call to fetch the content, so 
if you skipped a version, you might have just come across this. I think 
it might be related to your being on Windows 7. I tried it on a couple 
of Win10 machines and it was fine. I don't have any Win7 machines here.

Also 0.8.9 was upgraded to use a more recent .NET runtime, so again, 
this might have just come up now if you skipped the previous version.

&gt;<i> There was no prompt that a restart was 
</I>&gt;<i> needed, and I haven't found anything interesting in the Windows event 
</I>&gt;<i> log (has anyone ever?!).
</I>
Not very often! Thanks for checking.

I'll try to do a new build with some more debugging information in it 
and send you a link off-list. Maybe we can get it working on Windows 7. 
For now I created an issue on the repo here:
