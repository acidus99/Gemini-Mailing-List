As with most things in Gemini, this would be entirely optional.
Either the =: or my format wouldn't take much longer to code into
clients, as they are both based on existing features and follow all of
Gemtext's simplicity rules on line-by line etc.
Outreach luckily isn't much of an issue - most of the people that will
need to know are on this mailing list, and if/once it is a thing it
will be documented.
I don't understand your &quot;maintaining&quot; a standard point, it's a
standard, it should not be changed once it's been decided on (except
minor adjustments if required).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the reasons above, I'm relatively indifferent to metadata but think
</I>&gt;<i> it's a fair lot of time to pursue(at least to the same degree as &lt;meta&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> tags have gone). Personally, if a person was to create and adopt a
</I>&gt;<i> standard, I'd use it if it's useful AND human-readable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It should DEFINITElY be human-readable, Gemini (the protocol + text
format) is supposed to be a &quot;human-style&quot; thing.
