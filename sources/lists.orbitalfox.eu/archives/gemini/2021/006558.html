If servers have not yet been fixed to use close_notify, then there's no
hope that they would implement any new companion specs / technologies
for providing integrity.  If a user of such a server wants integrity,
then they should request it of the maintainer of the server code, or
switch to a different server; there are many out there with the same
features.

&gt;<i> &gt;And every single authenticated encryption method provided with TLS

</I>
Integrity on the server-side is out of the scope of Gemini, and is
really an implementation detail.  If a server operator decides that they
need to worry about on-disk integrity, then there are already good
solutions for that (e.g. RAID); and in-RAM corruption is so rare that I
don't think that adding a whole Gemini feature is worth it - it would be
so rare that the costs of adding it (in terms of computation and network
transfer) outweigh the benefits of detecting it.  In addition, in most
cases of on-disk or in-RAM corruption, the end user will easily be able
to tell that something went wrong, and if they find that it's a
consisent issue, then they can mail the server operator and let them
know.
