</I>This right here.&#160; Try this, living within geminispace for awhile. Gemini 
is kind of mind-blowing at the start (&quot;redo the web!&quot;), and easy for 
one's mind to want to extrapolate on. Seems like many people go there, 
to the &quot;this is great, but...&quot;.&#160; But Gemini has already had a lot of 
discussion and implementation and what have you, to be at this point. 
See what you think with a little time.

I think it's telling that as far as I can see, these other ideas that 
could have spun off of Gemini and gotten farther and had more uptake if 
they were more or even equally compelling, seem to not have done so.
