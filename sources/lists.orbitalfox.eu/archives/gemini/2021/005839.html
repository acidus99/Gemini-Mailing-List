<PRE>
  To give the &quot;TLS close&quot; issue some context:  The Gemini protocol does not
indicate how big a given response is, mimicking gopher and the very early
HTTP protocol.  In gopher with a non-binary file being transferred, a &quot;.&quot; on
a line by itself indicates &quot;end-of-file&quot; and for binary files, it's up to
the client to keep reading until the stream is closed (RFC-1436 states as
much: &quot; Note that for type 5 or type 9 the client must be prepared to read
until the connection closes.  There will be no period at the end of the file
...&quot;).  Gemini inherited this model and no attempts to include a reponse
size has been accepted.

  So, all a client has to go by in Gemini that a file was sent correctly, is
to wait for the server to close its side of the connection, as signaled by a
&quot;TLS close&quot;.  This means that issues with the network between the two
endpoints (a router crash) are caught, as well as the server crashing before
it can send a &quot;TLS close.&quot;

  Then someone noticed that TLS include semantics of &quot;this side is closed&quot;
and thus, why the server is expected to close the connection, not the
client.  Also, it was never an expectation that the client close its side
after making a request.

  Hopefully, this provides enough background on this topic from a Gemini
perspective.
