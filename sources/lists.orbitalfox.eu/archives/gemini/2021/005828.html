Regarding Gitlab issue #2 &quot;TLS Close&quot;, may we ease client and
server implementations by:

1. Not requiring client applications to send TLS close_notify,
since they indicate end-of-data via the request &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; ?

2. Only requiring server applications to send TLS close_notify
if all data has been sent? If the TCP or TLS connection is
interrupted by the client or by an intermediary before the server
application has transmitted all of its data, there doesn't
seem to be a benefit to sending a close_notify to the client
and it could also cause various delays which prohibit the server
application from moving on to other work. For example, an
unending streaming response would be closed by the client,
in which case there is no need for a close_notify from the server.
