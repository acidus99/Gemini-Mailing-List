<PRE>I think that Titan exists and is on the same level of complexity as Gemini, and it&#8217;s used in Lagrange, Elpher with Gemini Write, and a bunch of command line tools.

I think the details of POST requests are tricky: another encoding, parameters in the headers, parameters in the body. Even a PUT might be simpler. But again, you have header parameters to consider. In a way, Titan is just a PUT request with a fixed number of headers (parameters). It&#8217;s the perfect trade off.

But as I wrote on <A HREF="https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2021-11-05_Capsules_for_Phoebe:">https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2021-11-05_Capsules_for_Phoebe:</A>

&#8220;after yet another discussion on the Gemini IRC channel where people said that the Titan protocol was a bad fit for Gemini, or that it was only fit for the particular wiki needs I had, or that writing stuff on Gemini via the web or uploading files via FTP or SCP was good enough. Well, I disagree. And not only do I disagree, but I wrote plenty of solutions:

Titan, obviously &#8211; I made it central to Phoebe; I wrote a command line client; I wrote an extension called Gemini Write for Elpher, an Emacs-based Gemini client
Spartan &#8211; out of curiosity, I implemented a Spartan plugin for Phoebe; I wrote a command line client
HTTPS &#8211; I implemented a web plugin for Phoebe, both for browsing and for editing
WebDAV &#8211; I implemented a WebDAV plugin for Phoebe and made sure it worked for both cadaver and Gnome Files
Hopefully it is understandable that I have little patience for people complaining about the existing solutions. There are so many of them, all I want to see is people supporting anything, anything at all, for their clients.

Luckily, thankfully, @jk has added Titan support to Lagrange.&#8221;

I would love for these endless circular discussions to end one day and for people to just write the client they want. Perhaps this is the main problem: people keep thinking about new ways to upload content because they don&#8217;t see many clients supporting it, thinking that the existing ideas must be too complex. But that is not true. I even implemented the Iapetus proposal for both client and server! All these proposals don&#8217;t need to be discussed, they just need to be implemented &#8211; and as I have shown, I think they can be implemented faster than they can be discussed on the mailing list, IRC, or anywhere else.

Just do it.

I ended up writing instructions on how to use it for my capsules (i.e. not wikis), in case you haven&#8217;t tried Lagrange:

Here&#8217;s the Emacs Lisp code I used to add Titan to Elpher:

Here&#8217;s a short video of how it can look:
