<PRE>Thanks for the response - I've inlined as well.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I hadn't given much thought to implementing specific mechanisms to make
moderation easier. I think I just thought, &quot;It won't be difficult&quot;.
Implementing specific tools to help moderate is a good suggestion. I'll
look into it.


&gt;<i> Also, remember that some days a reasonable person of good intent will
</I>&gt;<i> have a bad community day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes you don't need a ban, but just a takedown and a, &quot;hey, don't
</I>&gt;<i> do that&quot; backed up with bans for people who don't get the message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Too true. I like your suggestion of levels of response... I'll have to
think about that... maybe a pause button on new content? Rate limit... I
like it.


&gt;<i> You could also do invites so you can do controlled growth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I hadn't considered invites for general posts, but was starting to think
along those lines for facilitating community generation. A sort of ability
to make invite-only groups. Feels like an OK way to share moderation
ability. Maybe provide community managers with invite-only ability and a
pause button with eventual ban.


&gt;<i> &gt; Another option is to limit the *kind* of content that a new account can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provide. Say, no links? This could curtail a type of side-effect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (facilitating access to external content through my domain/server), but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not entirely, since text/gemini *without* explicit links could just as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easily be a link-in-plain-text that is copied and used somewhere else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Limiting new account privileges is a one way to start, in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> no-links, no-attachments, no tagging other users, no direct replies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the issues I dealt with, was too many permissions for new posts
</I>&gt;<i> which caused confusion or missing steps in process. That's less likely for
</I>&gt;<i> people just making posts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think I agree. One of the points about text/gemini that I've enjoyed is
that there's so little there to begin with - not much to remove if a more
limited format is what's wanted.


&gt;<i> &gt; A third option I'm considering is to limit the visibility of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; content that a new account can provide. I've written an HTTP server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that provides access to the Gemini content, so, maybe I disallow any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; content from accounts less than say, 1 month old?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A friend has given a lot of though to the onboarding problem,
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/aredridel/470d6d186f3d848b3a7eeb6f8fa8dcf9,">https://gist.github.com/aredridel/470d6d186f3d848b3a7eeb6f8fa8dcf9,</A>
</I>&gt;<i> and one of the suggestions is about getting people into community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So you could ask someone joining &quot;what content you want to find? Cooking,
</I>&gt;<i> Rust, anime, crochet, axe throwing, etc..&quot; and plug them into that
</I>&gt;<i> community
</I>&gt;<i> to start, then broaden the scope as they make connections.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You will have to do some bootstrapping of community, but expectations
</I>&gt;<i> are a lot easier to build out of a group of people invested in making
</I>&gt;<i> community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks for the link!

I think I'll have to spend some time thinking through flipping the problem
away from being about privacy... it's a different take...

I like the exploration of onboarding communities as a unit... not one-off
as individuals. Something like... you can start a community if you can get
5 others to join you in the waiting room and agree together to start a
community... or something...


&gt;<i> &gt; The last option I've been mulling over is to just accept the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; side-effects, but that feels too much like an ends-justify-means
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approach which I find weak as a motivation... but... I *almost* prefer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encouraging communication and creation enough to endure negative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; side-effects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Creating community and creation are good, and don't get in the the way
</I>&gt;<i> of people doing that, but doing things in the way that someone can't
</I>&gt;<i> wreck the place either intentionally or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's what I'm dreaming of - I feel heard and helped - thanks!
