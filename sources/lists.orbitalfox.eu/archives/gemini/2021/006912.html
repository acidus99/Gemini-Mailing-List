<PRE>Tell that to the guy on another topic arguing that 'oh this old hardware is useless.' personally the response posted was perfect in explaining that mentality is what generates e-waste.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Projects like The Old Web exist, and frankly make me smile as it gives old hardware a way to Web, or at least explore the web that was, somewhat natively. However I feel trying to force Big Web on such old machines is 'solving' the square peg round hole problem with a sledgehammer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Problem is while gopher roots would hint at the audiance here has a higher than average number of retro enthusiasts there is no gurentee at anyone caring to see what, say, Lagrange can be ported to.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also have another thought for devices that can't natively do tls involving both a client, and a pi zero, or Arduino, or even something built into that wifi to serial port device (forget the name but that is just so danged handy to have if you retro.) To handle the security bits so that those older devices can join in on the fun.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let the web demand more and more resources. Give old platforms as well as new access to Gemini.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I just... Don't know if anyone here is actually interested in Doing The Thing. I just think it'd be neat and would get coverage by people like Micheal mjd, lgr, etc alongside.

</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, this is quite the good idea.
