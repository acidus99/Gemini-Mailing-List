<PRE>I know &#8212; but I think there is a tendency for semantic elements to
eventually become (defacto) style elements.

&#8258;

The sense I have of this is &#8212;

Regular people don't care whether these were originally for mathematics or
not &#8212; they look like bold versions of characters. And a number of people
are already using them as such. (There are even online tools to help people
use them.)

&#8258;

If Unicode doesn't come up with a semantically &#8220;pure&#8221; convention for
bolding &#8212; people will just use these.

And it isn't like we haven't been through this before.

Back in the day when terminals were common, some of them extended the set
of control codes (beyond those that came with the character set), to
include bolding.

For example &#8212;

\e[1m

&#8258;

Also &#8212;

We (in this community) are doing semantically &#8220;impure&#8221; things too.

Unicode has more than one symbol for making bullet lists &#8212;

For example U+2022 &#8220;&#8226;&#8221;.

Yet when we write Gemtext we use the asterisk (U+002A &#8220;*&#8221;) for the bullet
in the bullet list item.

And I know this didn't start with Gemtext, and it is an old convention. But
we are continuing it.

&#8258;

And yes, I know, not everyone's keyboards can easily generate U+2022. But
some people's can. Mine can. And (if that is a concern) U+2022 could have
been a permitted Gemtext bullet list symbol (in addition to the asterisk).

&#8258;

If Gemtext can ignore the original semantics of the asterisk, the
back-tick, the pound symbol, the equal symbol, and the greater-than symbol
&#8212; then why can't we also do the same with those mathematical characters?
