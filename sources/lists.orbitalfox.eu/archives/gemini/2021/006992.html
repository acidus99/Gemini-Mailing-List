<PRE>This started by me going through earlier discussions (I still have no
idea how to condense the search down so it isn't blindly scrolling) on
different methods of replicating discussion/forum and the one I liked
most actually isn't a really discussion board/thread type of feel.

I don't have the archive in front of me, so forgive me if I have
misinterpreted the original idea.  However this is my proposal even
though I don't know how hard it is to implement technically, or if
there is any kind of want. This is just me seeing several threads
covering 'we want more discussion that isn't retreating to BBS's, or
crawling back to the web' and having a brainwave that 'maybe this
could help solve the problem of how to find new content since the
search engines don't seem to be doing so well (or maybe it's just me.)

File this under 'MOL' to keep with the naming convention of the protocol.
=&gt; <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_Orbiting_Laboratory">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_Orbiting_Laboratory</A>

You would give your server a list of gemini pages (specific singular
pages or whole domains) to look through hourly/daily/weekly (I would
suggest daily as a default  to avoid spam) and if a specific
subheading comes up (example if the line after H1, or closing
unformatted text (in the case of pages starting with ascii art) is a
specific string (Example: Banana) it would send you an email
notification that 'banana' has come up and give you the link/s. This
is Stage One. I am sure you're going 'well that sounds like RSS/Atom
you're reinventing the wheel.'

Stage Two involves the same server backend searching your OWN gemlog
and if 'banana' is found because you read the inload and want to write
a page either responding or linking to that page the following
happens.:
* Server takes the links and timestamps of the latest sweep it did for 'banana'
* Server then adds at the end of your 'banana' gmi file these links.
Exact formatting could be user editable, but by default I want it to
have an H3 heading [Most Recent uses of 'Banana'], right below that
heading [Terms searched from select Gemini capsules from $DATE to
$DATE].
If the update interval is longer than one day. If update interval is
shorter than one day: [Terms searched from select Gemini capsules on
$DATE : $LOCAL_TIME]
* List is populated with links.
* Footer text is applied if applicable. This text can include a series
of separator characters followed by navigation links or a simple EOL
statement.

Potential applications:
* Direct discussion between differing gemini users.
* Pooling information on a given subject or theme so that the end
reader can immediately jump between tasks
* Ease the creation of Web-Ring like site chains.
* Experimentation.

Potential Issues:
* The fact this assumes a known site list greatly limits propagation
as it doesn't matter if several user clusters adopt this if none of
them know the others exist for the sake of link creation. At the same
time, though, this could also be seen as a positive depending on if
the server admin wishes to limit who and what they wish to interact
with.
*Low Adoption Rate: There are already several server setups out there.
While this feature could be seen as useful, given it must compete with
simpler solutions for those that 'just want a stinking capsule' along
with options like Flounder that are currently feature locked due to
code maintainer/s not having the time or interest to do more than
debug. This is one of those features where you either need a
reasonably high adoption rate, or it dies out.
 * Inability for the proposal writer to properly articulate the
concept framework.

I am confident those with a better grasp of server operation and
programming could come up with a better system or at least optimize
the flow of operation. If nothing else, having a specific prefix
character to denote tags '+' or '@' as examples may help to allow for
pages that users want to appear with multiple search terms and or
allow strings that have more than a single word to them.

This is not intended to emulate discussion boards or mailing lists,
though I am sure there will be those that will treat it as such. This
is intended more for the sake of allowing document sharing between
several servers.
