I figured you had hit &quot;send&quot; prematurely, but I'm not surprised that mobile Gmail is still wonky. Google's motto ought to be &quot;Even in the future nothing works.&quot;

Yeah, email can be pretty chill as long as spam and office life haven't ruined it for you. :)

&gt;<i> It's just people's thoughts put into text. And a generally pleasant
</I>&gt;<i> space to be in.

I like the lack of immediacy; there's no option but to take your time and think.
 
&gt;<i> Agreed with all of this, Gemini is a place for people, and people that

I agree, but when I migrated to Geminispace again (this isn't my first time) I made sure that my website pointed to my capsule via portal.mozz.us. If people want to visit my site that badly they'll find a way.

&gt;<i> Gemini isn't just about it's privacy-by-default and it's simplicity,

I like not having to worry about presentation. Once I've formatted the text, how it looks depends on the client, and is thus no longer my problem. :)
