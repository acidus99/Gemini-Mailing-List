You're correct, Gemtext is designed to be a human-centric format, but also
very easy for computers to parse.
Whilst it's uses might not all be, the metadata should also follow this.
Think of metadata as like the front and back page of a book, it tells you
some extra info about it, but isn't the contents itself. In a virtual
bookstore (Gemini space) machines can take advantage of what's on the
book's covers and info pages to help you navigate or improve how you
interact with the books.

&gt;<i> (Really sorry Oliver for polluting your proposal)
</I>
Please don't worry about this, this is a mailing list and discussion is
what we do.
This isn't just for *my* proposal, we should be collaborating to create
something that fits everyone (or deciding we don't need it or something
else is better).

Most of what I'm trying to say is either correcting people, and discussing
the *formats* for the metadata.


There are really multiple discussions going on here:
1. The format and spec for metadata.
2. What would be allowed/counts as metadata?
3. What would we use it for? / Is it really something we should have?

1&amp;2 are linked together tightly.
2&amp;3 are also linked.
1&amp;3 are seperate.

Which creates quite the ruckus &#128517;


I've done that thing where I blabber about unnecessary stuff again so I'll
stop here.


(Again sorry about HTML mail, the GMail mobile app is balls, gonna see if I
can find something else)
