<PRE>Caster, amusingly, hast the opposite problem. I can tab to links, but
can't read text with the arrow keys.Using Orca's Flat Review, which just
looks at all objects on the currently visible screen (all objects it can
find, that is), I can read the text, but can't tell with that if
something is a heading, a link, and can't scroll either. I'll keep going
down the list of browsers on

Although I'm skipping terminal browsers for now, as Elpher works fine in
Emacs.
