Indeed, anybody who could pull this off would be a certified PogChamp&#8482;.

That being said, I'm not certain that this should be of high priority. I 
think a good Gemini landing page for a project is probably better. A 
Gemini export of `git log` might be worthwhile, but the rest can still 
be better seen with a git clone.

Expecting users to do a `git clone` for very large repos is unrealistic, 
of course. However, Gemini is not optimized for very large files with 
many thousands of lines. This isn't quite the &quot;DocuWeb&quot; niche that 
Gemini occupies.

Gemini is an *alternative* to the WWW, not a *replacement*. Bringing 
complete git frontends to Gemini doesn't seem as good as simply making 
good landing pages for projects. Sample content in such a landing page 
may include:

- the README
- Repositories with names, links, sizes, and last-commit dates, and 
	clone addresses.
- Links to the issue trackers and discussion platforms (e.g. lists, 
	chatrooms)
- License summary (could be in README)
- maybe a link to a paginated Gemini export of `git log`.

In other words, not a *complete* Git experience, but just what's 
appropriate for Gemini.
