Compression could be valuable to users with poor download speeds, 
especially those using an overlay network like Tor with a poor uplink.

I do like the idea of compression being optional; if a client supports 
compression it can get a Gemini file compressed, but otherwise a plain 
version. However, this does create a huge problem: clients would have to 
declare that they support compression, which opens up a can of worms 
(complexity, fingerprinting, etc.) that we should stay away from. 
Almaember's approach is much better:

I think the best solution is:

- Have clients optionally support pagination, like what most line-mode 
	clients (gmnlm, cgmnlm, diohsc) do. Show the first N lines/bytes 
	instead of downloading the whole thing; let the user scroll to trigger 
	downloading the rest. This probably should not be the default setting, 
	but that's up to client developers to decide.
- For big files, have authors link a compressed version: &quot;Dear reader, 
	this gemini file is large. Here's a link to a compressed version:&quot;
- Users can then select the link before they've finished 
	downloading/paging through the file.

This therefore doesn't need to be part of the Gemini &quot;standard&quot; but can 
simply be a recommendation for authors and devs. If it gains a lot of 
traction, perhaps it could be formalized using the word &quot;MAY&quot; in the 
spec (&quot;clients MAY also support the mimetype...&quot;).

Regarding a compression algorithm to pick: it should be one that's 
fairly common with a lot of libraries/implementations for a variety of 
platforms and programming languages, keeping with the rationale for 
choosing TLS 1.2+ over other options for transport-layer encryption. 
Although I'd love to pick Lizard for its speed, it's not universal 
enough to qualify.

Our best options are therefore gzip/DEFLATE and perhaps zstd. Gzip can 
actually get pretty small when compressing statically/ahead-of-time, 
where compression speed is less of a constraint. Tools like Zopfli and 
especially Efficient-Compression-Tool can get a dump of all posts on 
seirdy.one (~100kb) 41.1 kb, compared to 39.9kb with zstd -f19. The 
difference only becomes significant with Gemini files above 200kb.

=&gt; <A HREF="https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool">https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool</A>

I therefore vote for the following *non*-standard:

- Encourage authors of 50kb+ gmi files to link a text/gemini+gzip 
	somewhere near the top.
- Encourage client developers to consider supporting pagination (can be 
	optional and off by default), so only the first N bytes/lines are 
	downloaded before the user performs an action.
- Encourage client developers to support the text/gemini+gzip MIME type

Only after this gains traction and is well-received by users with 
constrained bandwidth should consider adding a &quot;MAY&quot; statement to the 
Gemini spec describing the text/gemini+gzip MIME type. Compression 
support should never be required.
