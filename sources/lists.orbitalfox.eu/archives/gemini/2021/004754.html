</I>Oh, it's a personal choice for your implementation, that's obviously
perfectly fine.  I was thinking it was a requirement for all
implementations or something like that.

&gt;<i> I like the idea of replying to a specific message of the thread, as we

</I>I guess the fact that it's using gemlogs (which are usually longer-form
than your average comment on a forum) as the posting medium mitigates
my main complaints with threaded forums&#8212;namely, encouraging low-effort
or otherwise filler comments and encouraging tangential and off-topic
discussions.  Upon thinking about it more, I think threaded would be
fine or preferable for this style of board.

&gt;<i> Maybe I should add the requirement that the post link to the board
</I>&gt;<i> thread as well as the post it&#8217;s responding to. This would ease
</I>&gt;<i> updating because you know exactly in which thread a message goes

</I>&gt;<i> linking to what you are anwsering.
</I>I think it would be best to just link to what you're replying too as
well.  As long as you take uri normalization and encoding into account,
it wouldn't be any harder to match a link to an arbitrary post in a
thread as it would to match the base board link.
