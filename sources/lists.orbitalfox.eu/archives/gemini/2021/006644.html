</I>&gt;<i>     blogspot posts I had made, as well as other general 'ehstbdo I
</I>&gt;<i>     want to migrate over' material.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Through that whole time I peek in at Twitter, diffrent discourse
</I>&gt;<i>     forums, older pho based forums (most notesbly brass goggles.) And
</I>&gt;<i>     on and on..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Which has left me pondering how 'we' would handle communities, or
</I>&gt;<i>     even if 'we' should.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     There is as far as I am aware, without going to http/s:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     * Mailing lists. Which are nice enough, but it just feels
</I>&gt;<i>     cluttered. Maybe it's just me, but I get all these mail
</I>&gt;<i>     notifications and 'im genuinely disinterested in most of these why
</I>&gt;<i>     am I here.' which is an inverse of how I am with forums. Just
</I>&gt;<i>     sorta mentally sort out what ai don't care about and focus on what
</I>&gt;<i>     I want. Maybe it's something on my end. Or is 'me' specific, but
</I>&gt;<i>     if the Gemini discussions primarily happened on a non mailing list
</I>&gt;<i>     format with an included mailing list? I wouldn't bother with the
</I>&gt;<i>     list format.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     * BBS; see I like BBS:s, but they suffer similar problems to
</I>&gt;<i>     gopher in that technically thee is still development, but it all
</I>&gt;<i>     has this problem of feeling archaic. Maybe a client can fix that,
</I>&gt;<i>     but it is a very, in my enthusiast it non technical opinion,
</I>&gt;<i>     kindof intimidating to try starting.&#160; I like how BBS's work, but
</I>&gt;<i>     there appears to be a not High but not low barrier to starting up
</I>&gt;<i>     and keeping the ball rolling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I don't even know if this post will get any traction or if I am
</I>&gt;<i>     overthinking things, but it would be nice tohave a way to have low
</I>&gt;<i>     bandwidth communities. However I don't want that feature set as
</I>&gt;<i>     part of Gemini. Just... Something Gemini like that focuses on this
</I>&gt;<i>     need.... Assuming it doesn't already exist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I have no idea what I am doing.
