Firstly, &quot;[when the] user takes [an] action&quot; is a misrepresentation of
the consensus about making additional network connections, which I'd
summarise instead as &quot;when the user explicitly requests that specific
additional network connection&quot;.

Secondly, this is currently not a 'rule' - the actual rule in the spec
(&#167;5.4.2) is:
&gt;<i> however clients MUST NOT automatically make any network connections 
</I>&gt;<i> as part of displaying links whose scheme corresponds to a network 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol
</I>...which is technically much more permissive. However, the intent
behind this rule is clearly to improve privacy and reduce waste of
bandwidth, so the practical interpretation of the rule is a lot stricter
than just the &quot;not automatically&quot; in the spec. The 'rules' in
Geminispace are not just determined by the spec, but also by the culture
around Gemini, and they not &quot;enforced&quot; by some official authority, but
rather through interactions between people. That alone means that
auto-fetching inline media is clearly not &quot;inevitable&quot;.

In general, it makes for unpleasant discussion when you assert something
without sufficient reasoning as a /fait accompli/, as an &quot;inevitability&quot;
that you are just &quot;recognising&quot;.
