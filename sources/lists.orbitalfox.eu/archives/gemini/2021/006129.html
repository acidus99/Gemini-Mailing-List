Hello

GemiNaut displays the full URI of the current resource being shown - as 
you might see when using a normal web browser.

My view is that the client should be transparent to the user about the 
location of the resource they are looking at. It is important they are 
informed of the actual location and the client should not obfuscate the 
location. If we start hiding content, the user may not be able to 
readily actually see the location, which may be a security concern in 
its own right.

We should not be trying to invent a new semantics for URLs - the 
population at large understand what they are, how they are used etc.

Ironically the gemini URI scheme does not permit users to put user info 
(user name or password) into the URI. However the status 11 allows it 
back in - this is the primary role of this code as far as I understand 
how people want to use it:

   &quot;In particular, the authority component is allowed and required,
    but its userinfo subcomponent is NOT allowed.&quot;

So no I won't be attempting to obfuscate URIs in GemiNaut and it will 
warn users if the server invites them to put sensitive info into the URI.
