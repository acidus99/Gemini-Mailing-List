 Nathan Galt &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini">mailinglists at ngalt.com</A>&gt; wrote 
 a message of 32 lines which said:

&gt;<i> Because Gemini complexity and browser diversity are fundamentally at
</I>&gt;<i> odds with each other, and the Web already chose complexity at the
</I>&gt;<i> cost of diversity, I&#8217;ve become much more against protocol/gemtext
</I>&gt;<i> additions.
</I>
Simplicity and non-extensibility are core tenets of Gemini so I think
we all agree it is important to keep this target in sight. But I do
not think it means to reject everything without even considering
it. This would be a simple course of action, but it may deprive us of
useful things, and may hamper Gemini's adoption. I think we should
rather consider each proposal for its merits (and problems), keeping
in mind the criteria (which are sometimes non-explicit: for instance
the &quot;only one network request&quot; rule recently proposed by Solene was
not explicit in the specification).

Using as an example two recent discussions (favicons and metadata),
instead of dismissing them immediately, we could consider:

* do they add to the network budget (favicons do)?
* do they facilitate fingerprinting (favicons do, metadada don't)?
* is there a risk they add a pressure on non-willing clients to
  support them (CSS would do: a Web client without CSS is not very
  useful, while a Web client without favicon support is certainly not
  a problem for user adoption)?
* what level of complexity do they add (none in non-willing clients,
  for favicons and metadata, very little for those who adopt it)?
* do they degrade gracefully for non-willing clients (both proposals
  do)?

Therefore, discussions on this list about new proposals are
reasonable, IMHO.
