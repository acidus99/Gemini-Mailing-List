Agree this is where Gemini's strength is; lightweight text delivery with 
just enough formatting for organization (though an argument COULD be 
made for linking to points inside the same document we don't have that 
so outside of the initial question's scope.)

I'm more 'ok what can this be used for that isn't obvious?' There has to 
be something that's going over my head that Gemini would work well in.

I keep wanting to come up with some example but between medicine head 
and general 'meh' it's a case of 'this sounds stupid.'

Like: 'hey make a graphical interface where each of the 
button/catagories just points at a specific gmi with that name and that 
gmi is just a set of links with relevant info text. and... 'oh come on 
that's just a reskinned browser that's dumb.'

and on and on to the point I'm just 'where's all this creativity I 
supposedly have? Come on it's a neat format find a f'ing use for it.'

&gt;<i> Messaging apps could benefit assuming they don't compete with WhatsApp.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> howso?
