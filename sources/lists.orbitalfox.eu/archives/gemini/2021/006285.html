Thank you.  A few thoughts:

I recommend making each change in a separate commit, to make it easier
to isolate and comment on.  In a huge diff like this [1] it's easy to
miss small, but important changes.

[1] <A HREF="https://gitlab.com/gemini-specification/protocol/-/commit/0235100151b57d9f5c3384acdacb4ad9986f7ae4?expanded=1&amp;view=inline">https://gitlab.com/gemini-specification/protocol/-/commit/0235100151b57d9f5c3384acdacb4ad9986f7ae4?expanded=1&amp;view=inline</A>

&gt;<i> The use of an existing TLS library SHOULD be used, but because not all

</I>
You probably meant to start with &quot;An existing TLS library SHOULD be
used&quot;, but what does this actually mean?  Existing as of when?  If
someone makes a new TLS library, it will also exist.  Also, many
libraries are abandoned, so it will never be the case that &quot;all existing
TLS libraries&quot; will support TLS 1.3, or even 1.2.

I don't think the final Gemini specification should mention libraries at
all.  They may be ok as a temporary justification for why TLS 1.2 is in
the spec, but let's see if we can get more clarity on this: what exactly
are we waiting for before TLS 1.3 becomes the minimum version?  Support
in BearSSL (which may never be added)?  Support in X% of clients and Y%
of servers?  Hard to say, isn't it?

&gt;<i> TLS 1.2 will send the server name and the client certificate (if used)
</I>&gt;<i> in the clear
</I>
TLS 1.3 also sends the server name (SNI) in the clear, unless ECH/ESNI
is used.  The issue here is that TLS 1.2 is not compatible with
ECH/ESNI.  But even with TLS 1.3, public keys need to be put in DNS in
order for ECH/ESNI to work, so it will probably not be a mainstream
feature (although it should be encouraged).

&gt;<i> A client MAY warn a user of a TLS 1.2 connection is established, and
</I>&gt;<i> SHOULD warn the user of a client certifiate will be transmitted via
</I>&gt;<i> TLS 1.2.
</I>
It's &quot;if&quot; rather than &quot;of&quot;, right?
