I have been thinking on this issue, going further than poetry, we could have environments for ASCII art. An ASCII art mark could tell the client, &quot;hey client this is an ASCII art if you are some screen reader, you might want to skip this environment&quot;

Abstracts, this could be redered by the client as a centered block perhaps

Poetry, which would be kinda monospace in the sense that it respects the spacing but could use some user chosen font (at configuration)

All in all, enviroments could be more like extra bits of semantic data than the client might want to use.
