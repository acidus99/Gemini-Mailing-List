Hello

This is not an either-or as I see it. We can have both a sense of place 
to assist navigation and memory AND at the same time avoid server side 
branding and attempts at aesthetic control.

My investigations in this direction led me to implement auto-theming in 
the client. The server has to specify nothing, but the client creates an 
automatic theme based on the site identity derived from the URL. For 
details see the auto &quot;fabric&quot; theme for GemiNaut client:

<A HREF="gemini://gemini.marmaladefoo.com/geminaut/">gemini://gemini.marmaladefoo.com/geminaut/</A>

To my mind this is sufficient to demonstrate that there is no need for 
any server controlled colours, fonts, favicons or the like - and at the 
same time we can build attractive UI experiences for the end user that 
are content-focussed and can assist the user in finding their way around.
