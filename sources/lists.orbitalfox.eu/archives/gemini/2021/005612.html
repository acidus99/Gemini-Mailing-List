I think this is a bogus point.  I never contributed to OSM, but from
what you're saying I suppose they use something like XML/SGML/...  Those
things are *meant* for extensions (the 'X' in XML stands for that),
whilst everything around Gemini is focused on non-extensibility and
simplicity, even at cost of missing features.

Let's think about that again, for a moment.

There are various people here, myself included, that would like to add
&quot;only a small change&quot; to the spec.  Everyone has their 20% of things
that would like to add to Gemini or text/gemini[0] because with that it
would be, oh, so much better.

But instead of thinking about what we may add, let's think about what we
have:
 - we have TLS because it's fundamental to guarantee confidentiality
   between servers and clients
 - we have status codes, because a page that says &quot;an error occurred&quot;
   or &quot;certificate required&quot; cannot be interpreted correctly otherwise
 - we have a media-type in the response, so users know what kind of
   document they're getting
 - we have links, so we can connect different pages, even across
   different capsules
 - we have titles, paragraphs, quotes and lists to express and organize
   our writings
 - we have pre-formatted blocks to allow certain types of
   explanations/presentations that otherwise would have been impossible
   (how do we teach how to write text/gemini in text/gemini?)

&gt;<i>From here you can notice how humanly-centric Gemini is.  We don't have
</I>features for bots (more than what it's absolutely needed at least) and
even more importantly we only have basic and necessary stuff.  There's
no fluff in Gemini.

If you think about it, we only have features that we can't objectively
live without (no links? no paragraphs? no media-types? ...) while we're
lacking various things that would be &quot;nice to have&quot;.

We don't have headers, because with them comes extensibility and
complexities, and we're getting just fine without them.  We don't have
inline formatting because it's difficult to handle client-side and we're
doing really fine without, etc.

Now, replying to the two proposals specifically, I'm against both of
them for various reason:
 - we're doing fine without them, so we can continue do so
 - they're bring extensibility which is against the &quot;spirit&quot; of Gemini
   (at least until now) and thus dangerous.

Specifically they have their own faults in my opinion:

 - the one adding the line-type =: (or whatever): you have to parse the
   whole document to extract the metadata and it allows for possibly
   unreadable text/gemini files[1]

    =: foo: bar
    # a document
    =: title: a document
    =: author: Omar Polo
    lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
    =: x-best-viewed-with: tinmop
    Quia ullam quae repellat. Dicta occaecati beatae qui...
    =: script: <A HREF="gemini://evil.corp/analytics.gms">gemini://evil.corp/analytics.gms</A>
    =: document-class: article
    =: x-song-im-listening-title: &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;
    =: x-song-im-listening-by: &quot;The Beatles&quot;
    =: licence: CC-BY-SA
    another pragraph? dunno
    --
    text: CC-BY-SA, code: MIT    (a lot of capsules have lines like this)
    =: prefetch-page: /some/other/page
    =: x-some-even-more-funny-meta-because-why-not yay!
    ...
    =: preferred-color: black-text-on-white-background

   An user on a non-sophisticate client cannot (easily) understand
   that.  It's just full of bloat.  (with non-sophisticate I mean
   something more elaborate than &quot;printf $url\r\n | nc ... | less&quot;.)

 - (your?) proposal of the ^^^ toggle line, while eastetically nice
   (I'll give you that!) has the additional drawbacks of breaking the
   concatenation.  As things stands, I know I can

    cat file1.gmi file2.gmi ... &gt; result.gmi

   and obtain a valid text/gemini file.  With your proposal, I have to
   write a parser that analyzes every file.  There are a lot of people
   who uses simple scripts/makefiles to generate their capsules with
   standard UNIX tools, this would (possibly) break them.  And even
   worst, the cat(1) example I gave before will break only *sometimes*,
   depending on the content of the files.  (let's not talk about how to
   merge metadata from multiple files...)

Also, the examples you gave in support of your proposals seems bogus
too.  Serving a mailing list archive over Gemini?  Cool, but why convert
the mails to text/gemini?  Wrapping them in ``` (with headers visible)
or serving them &quot;raw&quot; is not enough?

What I think is missing in all these discussions is a valid reason to
outweight the cons.

However, I feel that denying and turning down feature requests for
addition is not a good thing.  I think we should reflect on what's the
actual problem and solve it, because this smells like a XY problem[2] to
me.

If we want to give people ways to manage their local data, maybe because
they want to search across documents or do some kind of publications
over Gemini, then centralising metadata in one place is an option.
That's what I'm currently doing with my blog: all entries are pure
text/gemini files and there's a posts.edn[3] file with all the metas
(title, tags, date, song I was listening to, relevant XKCD, ...), and
I'm happy with the outcome.  It's easy to generate pages for either the
Web or Gemini, and I can easily adjust the &quot;layout&quot; when I want to.

If we want to build a better GUS I don't think that adding metadata to
text/gemini will solve anything, it will actually make things worst.
The point is, you can't trust 3rd-parties metadata.  Sure, I can stick a
description of &quot;About the interpretation of the Will of power in
Nietzsche&quot; with tags &quot;philosophy, nietzsche, will-to-power&quot; and a
category of &quot;essay&quot;, but you cannot trust me to talk about those
arguments in the page, maybe it only contains link to pics of cute
kittens :)

Why I think metadata will make things like GUS worst?  While full-text
search is not without its drawbacks, as Bortzmeyer reminded us, people
will abuse the metadata to &quot;go up&quot; in the search results, and the
outcome of that is crystal-clear on the Web, other than making the life
of who makes a SE more difficult, as now they also have to try to
understand if the metadata is actually relevant or not.

(sorry for the long mail)

[0]: mine?  I would love to have a syntax for definition lists and
     3-levels of un-ordered lists.
[1]: .gms is GeminiScript of course.  A minimal, non-estensibile and
     simple scripting language for your preferred client, hoping it
     doesn't lack support for it /s 
[2]: When people asks for Y because they think that will solve the
     problem X, instead of asking directly for X.

[3]: edn is like json, but for clojure, kinda.
