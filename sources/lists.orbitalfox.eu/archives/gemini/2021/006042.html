If you want to transfer files over an uncommon protocol that most people can't use, have you considered (S)FTP? Chrome dropped FTP support in version 88 and version 89 is the current version.

(Personally, I'm amused by how FTP has become _indie_ in the span of a year or two. NNTP and Gopher threw a great welcoming party.)

Also: why would you want to burden Gemini-client implementers with having to handle transfer encodings when you can just gzip (or .xz, or whatever the new hotness is) for small numbers of largish files? That sounds like a lot of server-writer-hours (implementing it) and client-author-hours (also implementing it) and server-admin-hours (turning it on for some files and leaving it off for others) for a tiny handful of users who can get manifestly better compression ratios by using an external compression program. I'd much rather have three more good (or even passable) Gemini clients _for OSs I'll never use_ than to have my favorite clients and servers all using a transfer encoding like gzip or brotli.
