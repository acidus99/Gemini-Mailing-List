Andrew,
Can you say a bit more about what feels cluttered about the mailing lists?
Do you have a mail client set-up and configured to your liking?
Are you making use of the topic filtering on mailman?

PS: As for NNTP, I run a server for a small group of people. Tempted to expand this group if we could form a network of NNTP servers.
