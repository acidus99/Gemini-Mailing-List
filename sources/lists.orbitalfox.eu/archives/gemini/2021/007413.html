<PRE>&gt;<i> And I have come not to bring peace, but the sword.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, not really.  Sorry, couldn't resist a little drama.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But I *have* come with a strong resolve to move things forward quickly, 
</I>&gt;<i> decisively, and if necessary unilaterally.  I will be putting the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;dictator&quot; in BDFL (but not ignoring the &quot;benevolent&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My thoughts are something like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The never ending discussion (and at times heated argument) that has 
</I>&gt;<i> characterised the efforts to collectively and openly finalise the spec 
</I>&gt;<i> using this mailing list, and the associated risk of leader burnout, now 
</I>&gt;<i> feel to me like they are a larger risk/liability to the project than the 
</I>&gt;<i> prospect of making slightly suboptimal and/or unpopular decisions when 
</I>&gt;<i> wrapping things up relatively quickly and without agonising over every 
</I>&gt;<i> little detail.  The sooner the spec is finalised the sooner we can spend 
</I>&gt;<i> more of our time and energy reading and writing Geminispace content.  
</I>&gt;<i> People who aren't interested in spending time and energy doing those 
</I>&gt;<i> things have no place playing a strong role in deciding how to finalise 
</I>&gt;<i> things, anyway.
</I>
really happy to hear this! i haven't spent much time on the lists, but i 
have been around geminispace and i've been loving all of the lovely 
posting that folks have been doing there ^^

i really appreciate your work ~solderpunk, gemini is and has continued 
to be a breath of fresh air amoungus in the tech world. i never thought 
i'd find something simple and nice enough that my non-tech partner would 
actually enjoy using, but she immediately picked it up and started 
publishing her recipes on our capsule. made me really happy to see her 
feel empowered to own a little slice of the internet.

i'm not sure what i can do to help with the spec finalization process, 
i've considered gemini as &quot;essentially complete&quot; since for a long while, 
but i am willing to help. seeing a software standard that can be 
considered complete and finished is such a rare and beautiful thing. i 
hope the same can be said for many of the gemini clients and servers in 
the wild: it is finished.

cheers,
romina xj ix
