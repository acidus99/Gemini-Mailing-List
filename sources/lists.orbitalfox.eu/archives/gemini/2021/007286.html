As someone who's making a basic gemini client, having the whitespace
makes it alot simpler, you can just split the line on the space and do
a `switch` on the first part.
Not having a space means you'd have to test if the line starts with
different things, which would be very annoying and slower in most
cases.

Having the whitespace is easier for clients, and also looks better.
I see no downside to enforcing it in the spec (a SHOULD or MUST).

</I>&gt;<i> I know also the &quot;don't extend gemini&quot; mantra, and I repeat myself too.
</I>
Clients can do what the hell they like IMO, as long as things that
transmit over the net obey the spec.
So gemtext is pretty unlimited, but making protocol requests is
strictly limited.
Something like replacing `---` is entirely a client-side thing and
affects no one but the reader.

The spec is a baseline for a minimum working thing, there's a reason
alot of it is &quot;SHOULD''/&quot;MAY&quot; rather than &quot;MUST&quot;.
