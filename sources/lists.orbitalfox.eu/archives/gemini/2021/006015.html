hmmm,  with some form of padding yes. But without padding, I am not so sure.

I have seen many time this argument about complexity. I find it a bit
fallacious (no offense intended!). The client or server is &quot;not
complex&quot; because 99% of the complexity (TLS) is assumed to be already
implemented in a library available everywhere (eg. OpenSSL). We could
say in the same way that a modern HTTP client is not complex - and is
an afternoon project - because LibCurl is available everywhere :-)

&gt;<i> 3) is just not backward compatible.
</I>
My point is not about the protocol. Just what the capsule owner and
server software could do.

&gt;<i> &gt; Has any server author designed some sort of countermeasure against
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; length-based attacks?  Has it been already discussed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Length-analysis prevention is not Gemini's job, it's the job of TLS.

</I>&gt;<i> seems that currently clients and servers have to opt into using padding,
</I>&gt;<i> and the amount of padding and how it varies is implementation-defined),
</I>&gt;<i> but we can definitely look into it, and perhaps provide recommendations
</I>&gt;<i> for it in the Best Practices document (as seems to be what's happening
</I>&gt;<i> with close_notify(), IIRC).
</I>
I didn't know about TLS padding. Thanks for pointing it out. I will
definitely look into it.
Has anyone already used it in this sort of context?

Cheers

Phil
