<PRE>I think that we could add to extend the 1x status codes to support form inputs and secure form inputs.

Each field could have validation rules and hints to specify to the client that a field&#8217;s value should not be echoed. 

The size of the each submitted field would also need to be sent to the server so that the server knows when input ends.

With this in place, we have something that at least covers text data submission.

As an alternative, we could either merge the Gemini and Titan protocols or keep them separate but refer to Titan in the Gemini spec for &#8220;advanced&#8221; input.

Regarding payments, how would 3D-Secure work for traditional card payments? Maybe we could also look into digital wallets?

Lastly, I think section 1.6 of the Gemini FAQ is something that may be worth taking a look at again: <A HREF="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/faq.gmi.">https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/faq.gmi.</A> Gemini never was intended to replace the web. I&#8217;m completely fine with these suggestions I made being completely dismissed. Some problems are just better suited for another protocol to handle. What so you all think?

I see an opportunity for another protocol to be developed instead that builds upon the foundations of Gemini but actually does try to replace the web.

P.S. Thank you for making for creating a Gemini library!

</I>&gt;<i> &#65279;Hi everyone,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Its main advantage is that it follows patterns established in [net/http] package, which makes it easy for people to start writing Gemini servers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also adapted my favorite httprouter package to this library:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="https://github.com/kulak/geminirouter">https://github.com/kulak/geminirouter</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The code seems to work well and I have a small test site: <A HREF="gemini://www.argfac.com">gemini://www.argfac.com</A>  The website is not of much value as it simply shows Gemini and Titan based chat setup that I have tested only on Lagrange.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I used the following resources:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - <A HREF="https://gitlab.com/gemini-specification/protocol/-/blob/master/specification.gmi">https://gitlab.com/gemini-specification/protocol/-/blob/master/specification.gmi</A>
</I>&gt;<i> - <A HREF="https://communitywiki.org/wiki/Titan">https://communitywiki.org/wiki/Titan</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think I saw somewhere a reference to another &quot;update&quot; resource protocol, but I just could not find it.  Titan documentation was a bit on a hard to consume side and I actually had to dig Lagrange network level code to figure out what Titan is supposed to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the following are core promises of Gemini that make it great:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. no user tracking
</I>&gt;<i> 2. demonetization as partial result of #1
</I>&gt;<i> 3. no adds, because it requires user to click on image.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. true focus on content delivery and not the presentation. The improvement in usability due to ability to apply &quot;stylesheets&quot; at browser level and not at creator level.  This itself has huge positive impact on ability to consume information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, I have some criticism that comes with positives.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Gemini as of today will not scale in interactive usability, because user interaction is severely limited.  There is a statement that Gemini is only for consumption.  However, we have to be realistic that for usability of consumption to stay high, user cannot be asked to live Gemini browser for HTTPS powered web browser to submit a post.  That breaks user flow and makes Gemini not worth it.  Why to come back to Gemini if I just used standard browser to do something and in the process I compromised all the advantages listed above?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Titan protocol is a good step in the process and perhaps is the only required step.  I am not sure.  We have to remember about need to support multiple screen types from desktop to mobile and it is tough to create something acceptable and generic for user input under the restrictions Gemini protocol put in place.  I am hoping people here come up with something :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also would like to raise people's awareness, that if the network to grow and get any close to big, people shall expect that network would promote payments models, because it kills advertisements so efficiently.  I think it is a good thing.  I want to consume a product and not to be a product.  If I am a product, then UI tends to focus on makings adds prominent and waiting my time. That goes back to value of Gemini and consequence of its proposition is non-add based models.  I hope.
