I'll be the first to admit that this doesn't address all your issues, since I had an old GitLab account that was just lying around, CloudFlare doesn't hate me, and I'm not particularly web-intolerant, but...

As a lurker, the interface for spec discussion on GitLab is a *lot* like spec discussion on the main list. I went to the protocol and gemtext pages, opted to get all notifications, and then e-mails started coming into my inbox. I set up a couple filters on my end, and now they get auto-filed into folders. At the bottom of all GitLab e-mails is some text saying I can reply directly to the e-mail or visit the GitLab website to reply.

As someone who's fine with mailing lists and likes his e-mail client, this is not an unpleasant steady state of affairs.
