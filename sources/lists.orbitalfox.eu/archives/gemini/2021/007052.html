<PRE>I definitely think this should inform the way Gemini is introduced. More 
generally, you'll want to pre-empt all the usual questions like 
&quot;wouldn't it be better if Gemini had X feature&quot; or &quot;how is this protocol 
supposed to replace the web&quot;.

Personally I would be careful to avoid words like &quot;replacement&quot; or 
&quot;alternative&quot; when describing Gemini; in fact, I would try to minimise 
direct comparisons to the web to the extent possible. From what I've 
seen on places like Reddit or HN, confusion about Gemini's purpose seems 
to be the main source of negative feedback so trying to address that in 
your talk might be an effective way to get more people interested.

&gt;<i> Unsure if this is something that will fit your tone or presentation length, but an explanation on Gemini as supplementary protocol rather than 'well why not refit the search query so you can use that to make a message board/chatroom/etc' or 'how about we add *thing*?'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Arguments could be made for an expansion of Gemini, but the point of Gemini is this is literally all it does or really should do. Video streaming, shopping/banking, hat, message boards, etc are problems other protocols can solve and more power for people who come up with lean solutions for each (though I suspect shopping/banking won't ever change as you need institutional backing to roll those out.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For a time I grumbled st the lack of Gemini content on YouTube or odessy and couldn't understand why. Thing is Everything that strictly needed saying already had been along with the fact Gemini itself is exceedingly niche. Sure I would love more people talking about it, but at the same time? What else is there to say?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe going into what people can do server side?
