I understood what you meant, was just expressing my view of it :)

IMO the favicon isn't presentation, it's dosent modify the document itself.
I don't really know if I like/dislike the favicons, so I'd like to refrain
from commenting on this much, I just know that I don't like their current
form (of a seperatate request).

I don't know how webrings are organized on Gemini, but I'm not sure how the
&gt;<i> author or date would matter there.  From my understanding, these things
</I>&gt;<i> typically link to the whole gemini capsules, which should already provide
</I>&gt;<i> author information, and I don't think date info is relevant here.
</I>

I think there's been some misunderstanding - date and author etc don't have
anything to do with webrings as you said.

The issue is not that it would break pre-existing software, but that it
&gt;<i> would make it less appealing to use, compared to new software which does
</I>&gt;<i> implement the new additions. This applies to clients and servers and
</I>&gt;<i> everything in between. That's the 'rift' I was talking about in my
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>original mail.
&gt;<i>
</I>
 I understand your concern, and it's something we should aim to avoid, but
this kind of mindset prevents innovation.
If we stop creating new, or modifying old, because the old would get left
behind, we will forever be stagnant.
(To clarify, I'm talking in general there and not just about Gemini)



# My conclusion on the metadata topic

I think the discussion of the how (format and what it would affect) has
been good, but we should stop with it untill a good why (reasoning and use
case) has been found.



(Sorry if this ends up as a HTML mail, I'm on mobile at current and for the
life of me can't figure out how to disable HTML mode, boo GMail devs &#128078;)
