<PRE>Hello all, and welcome back Solderpunk!

I have a few things to say about the recent events in the community. But first, let's take the following axioms:

1. Gemini has been in use by a large number of people for years now, without a major change to the specification.

2. The mailing list represents a minority of the users and implementers of Gemini.

3. For the vast majority of users and implementers, the specification hosted on gemini.circumlunar.space (from now: Spec0) remains the authoritative description of the protocol.

With that in mind, I will get straight to the point:
I believe that the specification should be frozen, with Spec0 remaining authoritative indefinitely.
I am not claiming that Spec0 is flawless, however fixing any of its issues would likely cause more trouble than not doing so. In this case, I believe stable behavior to be more important than perfection.

As Solderpunk has pointed out, any proposal for change has been met primarily with criticism. If so, why do we want to force change through?

It has been proven in practice that Gemini functions well, and that no additional features were strictly necessary.

I believe, that in order to avoid more controversy, incompatibility between implementations, and power struggles, we should freeze the specification permanently.

Side note regarding Sp.'s return: With all due respect, I do not believe that you can realistically call yourself the dictator of the project. At most you can claim to rule this mailing list, which per axiom &#8470;2 is only a minority of the actual community. While I respect your role in the creation of the protocol (i.e., the whole of the original design), Gemini has grown larger than what a single BDFL can control. Especially after disappearing for months, I do not think we should consider your opinion worth any more than that of any other user of this mailing list. I do not mean to be harsh or hostile, simply expressing my opinion.

Regarding the axioms' truthness: the first two can be verified by simple common sense. The third one, however, is a bit more complicated. While it is not possible to prove, from my personal reading of this mailing list, and from the fact that gemini.circumlunar.space acts as the &#8220;front page&#8221; of Geminispace, I believe with a reasonable level of certainty that more people read that specification than the one on GitLab.

P.S. I'm not sure how and why I wrote this message in such a semi-formal tone, but it's like this now and I won't change it.
