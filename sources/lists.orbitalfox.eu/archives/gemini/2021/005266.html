</I>There may be a range of valid and invalid opinions :) but Gemini forms a 
hypertext system.

We are so used to the most pervasive hypertext system - the web - with 
its fine grained inline markup, we may not realise that it is simply one 
of the forms hypertext can take.

Gopher is a hypertext system too.

They are simply hyperlinks because Gemini is hypertext. We can call them 
links too as that is a common enough term.

As we know, Wikipedia has its issues, but its definition of hypertext is 
not bad

<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext</A>

&gt;<i> &quot;Hypertext is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic 
</I>&gt;<i> devices with references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can 
</I>&gt;<i> immediately access.[1] Hypertext documents are interconnected by 
</I>&gt;<i> hyperlinks, which are typically activated by a mouse click, keypress 
</I>&gt;<i> set, or by touching the screen.&quot;
</I>
Hypertext does have to be defined by a markup language, like the web or 
Gemini, but it is a good decentralised and scalable solution. Otherwise 
you need some sort of centralised system to define the hypertext graph - 
fine for small in-house hypertexts, but not scalable.
