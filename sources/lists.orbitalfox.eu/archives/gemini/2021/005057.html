<PRE>Such a project would be a great addition to the Gemini project. 

The domain you propose is still available, someone would have to spend the money for the domain to register. I can do that and would be willing to hold the domain in trust. However, I don't want to build a site like this myself.

And on the other hand, who would take the time to maintain the site, respond to issues and implement changes and translations requested by the community? It'll take some time and you won't get anything for it. Except some community love of course :-).

So if you want me to shell out the $12 for the domain, I would be glad to do it.
