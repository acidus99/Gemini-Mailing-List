<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm sure I don't know what you mean by, &quot;you two&quot;. I am but a single,
</I>&gt;<i> individual person. Perhaps that was a typo, I'm not sure, but you're
</I>&gt;<i> indeed conversing with a single person on my end.
</I>
Mailing lists are a multiplayer venue. This thread has two people,
yourself one of them, who have expressed that Let's Encrypt is easy.
You are not the person who said it was &quot;easier&quot; (emphasis on the &quot;er&quot;),
and the person I directly replied to in the thread with my comments was
someone who did. I suggest you review the archives if you're not
receiving all of the emails in the thread.

&gt;<i> Okay, Point of correction here. Drew, I know you to be an otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> upstanding person who prides himself in his capacity to provide service
</I>&gt;<i> to the community for a greater good.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But I stated what I stated, and that is not what I stated. Please do not
</I>&gt;<i> put words in my mouth - especially since I never said, *easier*.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I never implied that it was not also easy to use self-signed certs (and
</I>&gt;<i> most servers I'm aware of will perform this automatically if you don't
</I>&gt;<i> provide a certificate yourself).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I said is that it is easy (rather, Easy Peasy, I think) to use
</I>&gt;<i> LetsEncrypt to handle all of that automatically.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Trying to imply that I said something I NEVER said, which implies that I
</I>&gt;<i> meant something else, is beneath you. Please refrain from such behavior
</I>&gt;<i> in the future where it concerns me - a single, individual person.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not angry with you, I'll just chalk this up to you losing context
</I>&gt;<i> because you are  as passionate about Gemini space as many of us others
</I>&gt;<i> are that have been involved with the project since the very beginning. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't recall seeing any participation from you prior to about six months
</I>&gt;<i> ago. Again, that's okay, and I think your intentions are grand - don't
</I>&gt;<i> put words in my mouth though.
</I>
It's evident that you only have half of the conversation, which is not
my fault. I will note that you still refuse the basic courtesy of
Cc'ing me on your replies. Not sure what moral high ground you seem to
perceive yourself as coming from here.
</PRE>
