<PRE>As a note: I do not use git. I have had no real reason to USE git before 
beyond 'go clone this git, follow these instructions, and your whatsit 
should be up and going.' Which was helpful in getting proper wifi up on 
my machine.

I'm on my second read through since.... just at a concept level this 
gets a 'but why?' out of me. Ya, jumping to a whole new protocol is neat 
and exciting and has some uses. Re-purposing git has me scratching my 
head. In a way I get it at a conceptual level and like it. Have the 
client do a pull request for your material so that if something ever 
happens to yoru server their copy still exists. Which part of me finds 
agreeable.

On the other hand I dislike how Solderpunk is talking that the pull 
requests seem to be automated and continual whenever you visit a given 
site. What if I stumble on a site i don't want? I shouldn't have to go 
dig through settings to kick it out of the pull request chain. Nitpicky 
I suppose and easily fixed by making it a proactive choice to add a 
given site to your pull request list (Essentially your favorites list 
really.) The other is why not automate the process? I'm fairly sure that 
is something git already does and allows since I can literally go into 
command line and 'git clone: [address]' So having a timer function to 
make pull requests at x time and or when connect next' should be a 
no-brainer for clients to handle.

I don't like this as a solution though since it feels like one of those 
things that works just well enough to fix the problem, but doesn't solve 
the other problems Solderpunk himself admits this has yet keeps talking 
like it's 'temporary.' Software, much like carpentry, is a case where 
the temporary fix often becomes permanent.

So while conceptually having a git-like setup for gemini servers to use 
so clients with the git feature (or just users performing pull requests) 
is neat. The fact that the guy that is pitching this as a fix himself 
admits this doens't solve everything leaves me not liking it, since any 
fix down the road will have to account for this blessed by the creator 
concept is now out there and ... I mean there are worse things than 
having background pull requests that are handled by the client? I'm just 
afraid, as a user, that this could introduce something that would 
hamstring a more proper solution rather than this '80/20' that 
Solderpunk is speaking of.
