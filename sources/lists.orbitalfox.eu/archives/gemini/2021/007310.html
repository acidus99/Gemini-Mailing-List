<PRE>The spec currently indicates that there must be a space after the asterisk; the asterisk alone is not enough. I'd like to express support for the spec as it stands (space required), as asterisks have been in common use for plain text emphasis for as long as I've used the internet. Since many people compose their gemtext by hand, allowing the space to be omitted would likely cause quite a few accidental lists.
