<PRE>I'd like to chime in on a few points of discussion here that I think are
important and generally fall under the, &quot;please slow down&quot; heading.

First, while it's quite novel that a usenet group is being formed,
please do not move any official discussion there. It's more of a barrier
to entry for people than javascript on a git repo. We have this mailing
list. Stick with it.

Second, I want to thank Sean for his help and acknowledge that like
others I was not pestering him for updates as courtesy, not out of
disinterest. Solderpunk established an early pattern of &quot;make a change,
then let it sit for a while&quot;. I thought Sean was doing the same
regarding spec discussion, not realizing there was burn-out. I'm sorry.

Third, while it's nice that we have backups of the repo and discussions,
solderpunk has not handed over control of gemini to anyone else yet.
That means that any decisions to do so are jumping the gun. I see one of
three outcomes here: 1) solderpunk returns and is active again as BDFL.
He's recently been active on gopher, so it's a possibility, but not
likely.  2) solderpunk pokes his head in to appoint a new proxy leader
or leaders. This would be wonderful and I've emailed him to suggest it.
3) The community takes control away from him and runs with it
themselves. I would like to see this option the least, and certainly not
before a reasonable amount of time is given for solderpunk to return or
not. (I would recommend at least a month.)

If that situation happens we should all take a breather and think hard
about how to proceed and not just jump on whoever can clone the repo the
fastest or whoever speaks the loudest on a mailing list. There's a
larger gemini community watching and reading. Poke around in the IRC
channels, read peoples gemlogs. Take some time here.

</PRE>
