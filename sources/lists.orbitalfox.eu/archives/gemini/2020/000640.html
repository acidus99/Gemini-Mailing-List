I'm not sure you'll be completely sold, but I hope you'll see where I'm
coming from.

To try to boil it all down:  I absolutely agree that TLS has problems
and I don't doubt that other things, like CurveCP, might overcome or
avoid a lot of them.  But I believe something built on TLS is
overwhelmingly more likely to be widely implemented and deployed than
something based on literally anything else, and at the end of the day a
I think a good but not perfect protocol which becomes widely used and
supported will do a lot more good for the internet than a &quot;perfect&quot;
protocol which never becomes more than a curiosity for a small
community of enthusiasts.

This is not to say I don't think anything &quot;strange and new&quot; can *ever*
&quot;catch on&quot; or that I think any such efforts are a waste of time.  I wish
all the radical projects aiming at lofty goals all the luck in the
world, sincerely.  But there's a valid niche for something not quite so
radical which can still be a real and valuable improvement over the
status quo with very low barriers to adoption.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
