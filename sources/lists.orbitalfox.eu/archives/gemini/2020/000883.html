Sounds cool, as a tool unrelated to the official spec, just as a utility...

Right now, the verification load is put on the servers anyway, but this could also double as an easy way to get started with writing a gemini server, as you can just take the &quot;verify&quot; part, and not need to re-implement all the checks (and since you can cache the files with some simple checksum, it probably wouldn't be too bad performance-wise to run it as an external executable, even)
for being portable and embeddable, C is also a good choice, mostly because practically every platform has a C compiler, and a LOT of languages have some sort of &quot;CFFI&quot; or similar thing, &quot;C Foreign Function Interface&quot;, which lets you call C functions from that language, you can use a C library in python through that, for example...
python3 is probably very much OK for practical usage by humans

&gt;<i> - Something like the preformatted tag to indicate a second language within a text already tagged as
</I>&gt;<i> another language
</I>
I...don't think this is part of the spec, but I'd LOVE if there was a way to indicate multiple languages in one document... if you write parts in different languages (maybe are writing articles about conlangs, or want to have some quotes from another language, or something), then it would be really useful to allow signifying the change...
