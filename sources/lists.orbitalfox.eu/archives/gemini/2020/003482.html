<PRE>Ahoy!

CAPCOM is currently aggregating 98 feeds from across Geminispace.  I
intend to cap the number of feeds at 100.  The situation is not quite
as urgent as it sounds - I can cull some feeds which haven't
successfully been fetched in a long time because the servers appear to
disappeared, and perhaps I will also remove feeds which have not been
updated in, say, over six months.

My motivation for doing this is to encourage a decentralised
Geminispace.  As software support for the new lightweight subscription
idea increases, it's going to become easier than ever before for people
to decide whose content to follow for themselves, and to set up their
own aggregators - either for their own private use, or as public
instances.

If anybody has been looking for a nice Gemini project to help contribute
to the development of the community, setting up a themed public
aggregator is something worth considering.  You could set up aggregators
of tech gemlogs (or non-tech gemlogs), of political gemlogs (or
non-political gemlogs), gemlogs in non-English languages, gemlogs
written by people in particular parts of the world, gemlogs written by
minority groups whom you'd like to give visibility to, solarpunk
gemlogs, photography gemlogs, whatever you like.  Setting up such
aggregators not only makes it easier for people to find the content they
like, it sends a clear message to would-be content creators that
interest exists, and encourages people to start writing knowing they'll
have an audience.

If you set up a themed public aggregator, feel free to let me know and I
will add links to the main gemini.circumlunar.space in the &quot;Geminispace
aggregators&quot; section after CAPCOM and Spacewalk.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
