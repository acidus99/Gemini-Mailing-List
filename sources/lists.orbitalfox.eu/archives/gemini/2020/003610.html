A phonemic distinction -- a diacritic'd letter vs. a plain letter can 
differentiate words.  The same is not true of italics, which are 
typographic in nature.

&gt;<i> What's the difference between capitals and lowercase? 
</I>
This point is more warranted, I think.  After all, a lot of scripts 
don't differentiate between capitals and minuscules at all, and in fact 
the Roman alphabet didn't have it for much of its history.

However, the distinction is already &quot;supported&quot; in ASCII/UTF, which is 
why I suggested its use in lieu of the poorly-supported italic 
convention.  Use the tools we have, and all that.

&gt;<i> What about Hebrew
</I>&gt;<i> Vowels? Are all those &quot;metadata&quot; also?
</I>
I don't know enough about Hebrew to comment, but I would think it'd fall 
under my previous paragraph.

&gt;<i> Italics conveys data itself.
</I>&gt;<i> Italics is part of the writing system. It's not &quot;metadata&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> It's literally no different from using punctuation, or capitals.
</I>
The thing is -- if we were to include italics in the spec for 
text/gemini, it'd be set off *using* punctuation, a la Markdown or 
BBText or even HTML.  So why not just use that naked punctuation?  I 
think it's just as easy to understand that *this* is italic as if it 
were actually *in* italics.
