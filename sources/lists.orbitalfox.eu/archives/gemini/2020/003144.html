Now in that case, if the client does not cache, the page is reloaded.
Even if the client remembers the position where you were before in
that page, imagine the scenario where the page gets changed before
reloading (say, new links added to (or removed in) that page), then
you have to scroll anyway. (In the worst case, imagine the link you
clicked does not exist in the new page.)

&gt;<i> Again, I'm not sure if caching is involved in it or not, but that's the best
</I>&gt;<i> thing I could come up with as an answer to your question.
</I>So caching is required. Your client must keep that page in cache along
with your last position in that page for the feature you want.
