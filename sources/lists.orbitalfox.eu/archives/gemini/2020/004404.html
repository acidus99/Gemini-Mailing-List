Given the potential for &quot;what should fragments mean/do in Gemini?&quot; to
turn into yet another endless discussion, and given their relatively low
importance (Gopher has survived without them for 30 years and I,
personally, don't remember ever really missing them in that context),
I'm tempted to take quite seriously Petite Abeille's suggestion to
simply remove them entirely.  However, for the sake of responding
coherently to other issues raised in this thread, let's suppose
fragments hang around:

&gt;<i> 1) Clients MUST NOT send a fragment to the server.
</I>
I agree with this, and would be happy to make it explicit in the spec.

&gt;<i> 2) If the client gets a redirect containing a fragment, the client MUST
</I>&gt;<i> apply this fragment when the redirected resource is retrieved, ignoring
</I>&gt;<i> any
</I>&gt;<i> original fragment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) If the original URL has a fragment and the redirect doesn't, the
</I>&gt;<i> client
</I>&gt;<i> MUST apply the original fragment when the redirected resource is
</I>&gt;<i> retrieved.
</I>
This I'm not so clear on.  If a server receives a request for a URL
which doesn't include a fragment (which everybody seems to agree is how
things should work), why on Earth would it want to redirect to a URL
which *does* have a fragment?  The only case I can think of where this
might be useful is if multiple separate documents were merged into a
single document, with fragments pointing to the distinct subsections
which used to stand alone.  That's neat, but is it so important that we
should support it instead of doing the brutually simple thing of just
saying that redirect URLs, like request URLs, should not include
fragments, and that following a redirect involves completely discarding
the previous URL (including fragments)?  Carrying stuff across between
distinct requests feels a bit ugly to me.
