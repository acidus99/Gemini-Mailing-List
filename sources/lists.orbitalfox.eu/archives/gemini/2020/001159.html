Ugh, sorry about this email.  I was irritable from a lack of good sleep
and waking up to a whole slew of posts here about extra complications,
just as I was starting to feel we were at last approaching a kind of
&quot;cross the t's and dot the lowercase j's&quot; state where there wasn't much
left to add.  But I have no idea what your intended tone was and it may
well have just been tongue in cheek.  Mostly I was just annoyed at
learning that these <A HREF="data://">data://</A> URLs exist.  I hadn't been aware of them.
And frankly...what the hell?  Who thought it was a good idea to turn a
harmless way to indicate *where* some data can be found into a way to
shoehorn in the data itself?  What are we supposed to use in a context
where we don't want that to be a possibility?  Bah!

Cheers,
Solderpunk
