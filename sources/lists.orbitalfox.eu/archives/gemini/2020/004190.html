This is, indeed, pretty much the model.  I admit it is in many ways far
from ideal (although so-called &quot;benevolent dictatorship&quot; has a long and
not unsuccessful history in the FOSS world), although it's far from
clear to me what else can work well with a project that's supposed to be
small and simple with a clear, finite scope.

This model is clearly not sustainable in the long term (I might get hit
by a bus tomorrow), but I think this is okay because I don't view this
as a long term project.  This is a &quot;Perfection is achieved, not when
there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take
away&quot; kind of project.  I have no interest in regularly adding new
features or upgrading parts of stack.  So, there's no need for stable
long-term governance because at some point, and hopefully not too far
from now, things will be &quot;done&quot;.

More on that point shortly...

Cheers,
Solderpunk
