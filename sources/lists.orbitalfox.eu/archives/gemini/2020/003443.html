<PRE>Hi

Would it be useful to include something which tells
the software polling the feed when the next post could
be expected ? It doesn't imply an obligation, it is
just a hint...

I concede this adds more complexity in the markup, but
has the benefit that those polling the site don't need to hammer
it as much - that might be important as tls connections
are moderately expensive, and many sites run on very
small, shared or personal systems.

Maybe just the first/last link (pointing nowhere, or
to itself or some other distinguished name) with a timestamp
in the future could tell us when to poll again,
and if there is no future timestamp, the polling interval
could be some sort of backoff (eg the difference
between the newest post and the current time) so that
abandoned sites don't get polled needlessly, while
those wanting to be polled often just update their
future timestamps regularly ?

regards

marc
