That's quite true.  But the advantage of a notice is that a license
violator can't claim &quot;I didn't know&quot;. This is useful not only if you need
to go to court, but just to get them to take down their copy of your
content.  This often comes up when someone posts a copy with your name
removed, which of course CC-BY(-SA) does not allow.  If there is a notice,
you can send them an email saying very politely that they are willful
infringers of your copyright and may be liable for up to US$150,000 for
each illegally copied work.  They generally take it down fast.

The corporate world likes to hold on to all
&gt;<i> its rights (&quot;all rights reserved&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
By the way, that phrase has no legal meaning and can be completely
ignored.  It is neither a license nor a copyright notice.

&gt;<i> we don't have to - things like BSD, GPL and
</I>&gt;<i> CC-* are people saying that they are happy
</I>&gt;<i> to contribute to something shared, on certain terms.
</I>&gt;<i> And if these statements are embedded in .gmi files,
</I>&gt;<i> tools can be built which parse this.
</I>&gt;<i>

+1, absolutely

People go through the bother of Christmas because Christmas helps them
to understand why they go through the bother of living out their lives
the rest of the year. For one brief instant, we see human society as it
should and could be, a world in which business has become the exchanging
of presents and in which nothing is important except the happiness and
well-being of the ultimate consumer.  --Northrop Frye (1948)
