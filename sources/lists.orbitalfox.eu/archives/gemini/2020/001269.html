<PRE>It was thus said that the Great solderpunk once stated:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In short, there was supposed to be a single, concrete &quot;unit of
</I>&gt;<i> interface&quot; with narrow scope that a client author has to decide how to
</I>&gt;<i> implement.  Variation between clients in how that was done would not
</I>&gt;<i> substantially change the overall user experience.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With stuff like data:, feed:, tag:, geo:, and the myriad other
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;non-locational schemes&quot;, all of this goes out the window.  What is a
</I>&gt;<i> client supposed to do with all these?  
</I>
  Web and gopher clients already face this issue.  Web browsers have solved
this issue by allowing the user to configure a program to handle an unknown
URI scheme.  I've registered the &quot;gopher&quot; with Firefox to go through a
gopher proxy, so I can't see why this can't be an option for Gemini clients. 
I'm not aware of a scheme like mailcap (for handing of MIME types) for URI
schemes, but even a simple:

	gopher:	my-gopher-client
	http:	firefox
	https:	firefox
	geo:	missile-launcher

will be good enough (and not even mandatory---I'm just throwing out an idea
here).

&gt;<i> If I want to write a minimal
</I>&gt;<i> client that just knows how to follow <A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> links and nothing else,
</I>&gt;<i> what the heck do I do with a tag: link?  Display it to the user, or
</I>&gt;<i> hide it?  
</I>
  As a quick solution, how about just display a page with:

	I don't know how to handle tag:conman.org,1998-10-16:site
	Sorry about that.

Done!  Ship it!

&gt;<i> If I choose to display it using exactly the same code path I
</I>&gt;<i> would use to to display a <A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> link, I need to go out of my way
</I>&gt;<i> to make that code path robust against stuff that doesn't make sense for
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;proper&quot; links, like there not being a &quot;netloc&quot; component (AV-98
</I>&gt;<i> currently silently drops tag: links, for example, because they cause an
</I>&gt;<i> Exception when I try to handle them as if they were a &quot;proper&quot; link).
</I>
  There exists code to parse a URI, whether homegrown or a library.  At the
very least, the client can check the scheme portion for &quot;gemini&quot;.  I've
already seen URIs for http:, https:, mailto: and data: [1].

&gt;<i> If I *do* successfully display them as if they were a proper link and
</I>&gt;<i> the user tries to follow one, what is supposed to happen?  Assuming I
</I>&gt;<i> fix the aforementioned problem, AV-98 will say &quot;Sorry, no support for
</I>&gt;<i> tag&quot;, because it fills out a template that I designed thinking of cases
</I>&gt;<i> like &quot;Sorry, no suport for ftp&quot;, which most users will understand.  *I*
</I>&gt;<i> would be very confused by a &quot;no support for tag&quot; message, I'd think
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;What, there *are* no tags in Gemini, what's going on here?&quot;.
</I>
  I've already mentioned Firefox, but Lynx gave me &quot;Alert!: Unsupported URL
scheme!&quot; when I tried using a gemini: link on a webpage.  Don't sweat it.

&gt;<i> So, I'm not sure how to proceed here.  People should feel free to
</I>&gt;<i> experiment with possibilities, because informed decisions are better
</I>&gt;<i> than uninformed ones.  But I would advise people not to get fiercely
</I>&gt;<i> attached to any idea of how non-locational URLs might work in Gemini.
</I>&gt;<i> It's uncharted territory.
</I>
  I think your concern (or fear) is overblown here.  Outside of

	http:
	https:
	mailto:

I think other URI types on the web will fall deep into the 0.56% of links
that aren't the above.
