If nothing else, I think there's a small, useful role for a very simple
caching proxy which just maintains an in-memory cache of everything
visited which is valid for, say, five minutes.  The reason this is
useful is that navigating Gemini capsules often involves extensive use
of the &quot;back button&quot; (and, at least for me on AV-98, the &quot;up&quot; command,
which gets you from example.com/foo/bar/baz to to example.com/foo/bar/
even in the lack of an explicit link, and the &quot;root&quot; command, which gets
you from example.com/foo/bar/baz to to example.com), which often entails
loading the same page repeatedly in a relatively short window of time.
A very simple dumb local cache would cut down on transactions for this.

For people like me who often read something in Gemini/Gopherspace, then
want to reference a few days later but cannot remember where they read
it, a proxy which maintained full-text search of everything visited in
the past month or so would be *super* handy, but I have no idea how to
build such a thing.

I'm kind of attracted to the idea of small, simple, do-one-thing-well
proxies which can be chained together like &quot;filter&quot; programs in a
pipeline...but I guess the TLS overhead would stack up quickly,
encouraging a kind of highly configurable &quot;Swiss army knife&quot; proxy
instead.  Not as pretty, but potentially very useful...

Cheers,
Solderpunk
