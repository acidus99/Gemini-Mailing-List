<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm of the opinion that there should only be a fixed number of header levels.
</I>&gt;<i> It keeps the matching logic flat and straightforward. Three levels is few
</I>&gt;<i> enough that most clients should be able to come up with distinct styles to
</I>&gt;<i> display them. Fixed header lines are trivial to parse and provide a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> utility for organizing a document and linking to sub-sections.
</I>
I like that this would discourage the &quot;markdown hacking&quot; seen on GitHub where
unnecessary depth is used to make the HTML render look nicer.

OTOH, it would be easy for authors to:
* rotate header colors
* use the same colors for depth 4+ that they use for depth 3

&gt;<i> Quote blocks with &quot;&gt;&quot; would be ok if we could count on them being only a single
</I>&gt;<i> line long. However, many quotes will necessarily include line breaks that
</I>&gt;<i> should be displayed together in a single block. This complicates parsing in the
</I>&gt;<i> same way that lists do, so I think that quotes should also be omitted for the
</I>&gt;<i> same reason.
</I>
I'm strongly against reflowing quote blocks. I understand that we don't want
to display lists inside quotes in a fancy way, but I still think that we
shouldn't break them:

```
&gt;<i> My opinion:
</I>&gt;<i> * these lines
</I>&gt;<i> * should not be
</I>&gt;<i> * reflowed
</I>```

Speaking of which, should we explicitly disallow fancy-rendering lists within
quotes, or leave the choice up to client authors?

&gt;<i> If you want to display something like a quote from a mailing list message, I
</I>&gt;<i> think that would be a perfect candidate for copying it into a preformat
</I>&gt;<i> block. For other types of quotes, stick them between two horizontal rules to
</I>&gt;<i> separate them from the surrounding text.
</I>
Maybe. I still don't like the idea of quotes not wrapping with display width.

&gt;<i> And then what happens when
</I>&gt;<i> somebody uses more than 26 second level list items and we run out of
</I>&gt;<i> lowercase letters to use?
</I>
Simply use multiple letters:

```
a. lorem ipsum
b. lorem ipsum
[...]
y. lorem ipsum
z. lorem ipsum
aa. lorem ipsum
ab. lorem ipsum
ac. lorem ipsum
```

However, this may be complex. I'll try to write a simple client tonight to see
how difficult all this is.

Cheers!
</PRE>
