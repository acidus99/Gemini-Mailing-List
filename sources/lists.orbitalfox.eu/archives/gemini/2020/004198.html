&gt;<i> Our strongest possible defense here, IMHO, is keeping the core protocol so

easy to implement that there is always likely to be a wide variety of
&gt;<i> clients in popular use.  That way, companion protocols cannot gain
</I>&gt;<i> traction unless multiple independent client developers all agree they
</I>&gt;<i> are worth supporting.
</I>

As someone whose proposed extension protocol has probably made the most
noise, I would point out that Dioscuri clients and servers will typically
*not* be Gemini clients and servers, as they don't share the same use cases
at all.  Dioscuri native applications and front-end engines are not
browsers, and Dioscuri servers are more like Tomcat than like Apache.

To hold down on the number of posts, I'll just mention that the spec for
Dioscuri is now at &lt;
<A HREF="https://gist.github.com/johnwcowan/d3211496ad89125c77297c6586ebe176">https://gist.github.com/johnwcowan/d3211496ad89125c77297c6586ebe176</A>&gt;.  I
will probably edit it further, especially if there are changes in the
Gemini spec that also make sense for Dioscuri.  The TL;dr version of the
protocol is that the client sends a media type along with the URL; and
follows it with an appropriate body; otherwise it is the same as Gemini.

I want to specially acknowledge Sandra Snan, who said that Dioscuri needed
a server-served, client-executed programming language to make a front-end
engine programmable.  I agree, and I'm now working on just such a
language.  My sources so far are ABC (the ancestor of Python), PROMAL (a
programming language for Apple II and Commodore systems), Perl 1.0,
Microsoft Small Basic, and the libplot library, plus the ability to execute
REST requests at least via Gemini and Dioscuri.  It will have much the same
goals as Gemini (see the FAQ) insofar as they are applicable to language
design, and will be aimed at beginning and perpetual-intermediate
programmers without being too excruciating for advanced programmers.
