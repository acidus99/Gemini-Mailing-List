<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Bj&#246;rn W&#228;rmedal once stated:
&gt;<i> How does a client handle a link like the following:
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; essays/why-spaces-are-%20-in-URLs.gmi
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The assumption here is that the author has not percent encoded
</I>&gt;<i> themselves -- this is the actual filename, %20 and all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How can the client tell if it's percent encoded or not? If you start
</I>&gt;<i> by decoding it you distort the filename. If you just assume it isn't
</I>&gt;<i> percent encoded and go ahead and do that you will handle this link
</I>&gt;<i> correctly but break any links that are already percent encoded. I've
</I>&gt;<i> only done this in python, using the urllib.parse library. I can tell
</I>&gt;<i> that to encode or decode, but it will do what I tell it to without
</I>&gt;<i> exception. It's up to me to build logic that avoids breaking the edge
</I>&gt;<i> cases.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We can decide to *always* percent encode links in gemtext (as the spec
</I>&gt;<i> states now) or to *never* do it, but I don't see how we can reasonably
</I>&gt;<i> have both. And never doing it means we can never link to a file with
</I>&gt;<i> spaces in the URL, and will have to percent decode anything we copy
</I>&gt;<i> paste from web browser's address bar. There will be extra work for
</I>&gt;<i> authors either way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Consider another hypothetical case:
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; teddybearoftheyear.com/vote?ew0k%20The%20Great Vote for me!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How would you solve that?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However much I *want* to have IRIs and IDNs in gemtext and leave the
</I>&gt;<i> work to clients and servers, I don't have a solution for that as an
</I>&gt;<i> implementer.
</I>
  I don't have a solution either, and while trying to nail down every
possible corner case is admirable, sometimes, you just have to say, &quot;don't
do that!&quot; (or in other words, document or warn about the corner case).

  It's already the case on Unix systems where a file name can technically
have any character other than '/' (because it's the path separator) and NUL
(marks the end of the string), but I doubt you'll find any filenames with
control characters [1] or even &quot;problematic characters because of the shell&quot;
like &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, or &quot;*&quot; in them.  People just kind of learn what they can and
can't use for filenames over time.  In fact, that might be an interesting
thing for Lupa [2] or GUS to report on---characters found in filenames [3].

  I'm not sure how apropos this is, but years ago, when I was at university
studying Computer Science, I was writing a program (for a friend, not course
related) where I wanted to log errors so they would later be seen (as the
program would run unattended, and any messages to the display would not be
seen).  I could log to a file, but the disk could fill up.  Okay, if that
happened, I could log to the printer, but there might not be a printer (or
it could be turned off---this back when printers were hooked directly to a
computer).  I asked one of my instructors (who worked at IBM, and was on the
team for one of the first Fortran compilers for IBM) what I should do.  His
advice was (and as sad as this is, it's pretty true), if you don't know how
to handle an error, don't bother looking for it.

[3]	This reminds me, I have a new feature on my own server that allows
	one to dive into a ZIP file:

		<A HREF="gemini://gemini.conman.org/test/UCSD-Pascal-source.zip/">gemini://gemini.conman.org/test/UCSD-Pascal-source.zip/</A>

		vs.

		<A HREF="gemini://gemini.conman.org/test/UCSD-Pascal-source.zip">gemini://gemini.conman.org/test/UCSD-Pascal-source.zip</A>

	Right now it's not much of an issue since the filenames for the
	&quot;proof-of-concept&quot; file are just plain ASCII, but in the general
	case, I suppose I should support conversion of filenames to UTF-8,
	but that might be a hard case as well, as character encodings aren't
	readily recorded in ZIP files.
