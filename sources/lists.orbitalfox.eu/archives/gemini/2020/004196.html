<PRE>Le dimanche 13 d&#233;cembre 2020, 18:28:38 CET Jansen Price a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> I ran into the same problem when trying to add client certificate support
</I>&gt;<i> on my PHP server (<A HREF="https://tildegit.org/sumpygump/orbit">https://tildegit.org/sumpygump/orbit</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that `capture_peer_cert` is intended to only work
</I>&gt;<i> with stream_socket_client and not with socket servers. I started looking at
</I>&gt;<i> the source code of PHP to see if I could find the part that handles the TLS
</I>&gt;<i> handshake to find out if there is any way to get access to the cert that
</I>&gt;<i> came along with the connection, but I have not been successful in my search
</I>&gt;<i> yet.
</I>
So, I found something, it does work if you set verify_peer to true in the ssl context options.

The problem is that if you do so, a request without a client certificate will fail, even before you can know what is the request.

I&#8217;m not sure if you can change the context once a connection is accepted, if yes maybe you can attempt stream_socket_enable_crypto once with verify_peer and if it fails run it again without it, but it feels non-optimized.

This is related to the openssl behavior of <A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_get_peer_certificate.html">https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_get_peer_certificate.html</A>
It says: &quot;Due to the protocol definition, a TLS/SSL server will always send a certificate, if present. A client will only send a certificate when explicitly requested to do so by the server (see SSL_CTX_set_verify(3)).&quot;

According to <A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_verify.html">https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_verify.html</A> , a client certificate request is sent by the server only if SSL_VERIFY_PEER is set, which php will only set if verify_peer is true.

However, even if I was implementing this in C it is not clear to me how to request a client certificate without making it mandatory, is that what SSL_VERIFY_CLIENT_ONCE is for?
Are there Gemini servers in C with client certificate support of which I could read the code out there?
