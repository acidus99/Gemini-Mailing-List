We use TLS, not SSH.

These are configurable parameters. If they are configured incorrectly,
then we should reject the certificate. Someone may have configured them
with an expiration, for example, by design, knowing that their server
would soon disappear, and that certificate reuse signals that something
stinky is going on. Or the common name could be set because the admin
has chosen to set up their own certificate authority, perhaps complete
with signed client-side certificates, and the common name is used to
strongly identify the server.

Consider that the stakes are leaking your user's private information and
do your goddamn job as a responsible steward of their needs.
