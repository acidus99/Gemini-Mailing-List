Sure it can. But perhaps it shouldn't. Depends on how much reliability one is after.

See &quot;File size&quot; in &quot;Best practices for Gemini implementations&quot;:

Gemini servers do not inform clients of the size of files they are serving, which can make it difficult to detect if a connection is closed prematurely due to a server fault.  This risk of this happening increases with file size.

Gemini also has no support for compression of large files, or support for checksums to enable detection of file corruption, the risk of which also increases with file size.

For all of these reasons, Gemini is not well suited to the transfer of &quot;very large&quot; files.  Exactly what counts as &quot;very large&quot; depends to some extent on the speed and reliability of the internet connections involved, and the patience of the users.  As a rule of thumb, files larger than 100MiB might be thought of as best served some other way.

Of course, because Gemini supports linking to other online content via any protocol with a URL scheme, it's still possible to link from a Gemini document to a large file served via HTTPS, BitTorrent, IPFS or whatever else tickles your fancy.


Replace &quot;very large file&quot; with binary and you get the gist of it.
