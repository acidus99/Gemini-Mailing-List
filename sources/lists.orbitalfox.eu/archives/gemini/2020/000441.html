I am happy to add something to the Best Practices document regarding
HTTP proxies, which could include a polite request to inform me of
proxies and their IP addresses so I can maintain a master list
somewhere, as well as a strong admonition to serve a robots.txt which
prevents web crawlers from slurping up Gemini content.

I understand this sentiment, but at the end of the day it's literally
impossible to prevent this.  It's part and parcel of serving digital
content to universal machines owned and operated by other people - you
lose all control over things like this.  As was posted previously,
attempts to regain control with things like DRM just turn into arms
races that make life harder for legitimate users.  I'm in favour of
leaving things at a straightforward &quot;gentleman's agreement&quot;.

&gt;<i> The problem with this method is that, let's say, there's a GUS server

</I>&gt;<i> indexed by GUS, but I don't want to allow anyone to use the World Wide
</I>&gt;<i> Web to access my content.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   A second one is to extend robots.txt to indicate proxying preference, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some other file, but then there are multiple requests (or maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not---caching information could be included). 
</I> 
Extending robots.txt to do this seems fairly straightforward.  We could
introduce &quot;pseudo user-agents&quot; like &quot;proxy/*&quot;, &quot;indexer/*&quot;, etc. which
all user agents of a particular type should respect.

Cheers,
