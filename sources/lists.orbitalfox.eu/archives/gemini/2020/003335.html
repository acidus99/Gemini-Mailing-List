<PRE>Hey all,

I've been working on an idea today and I'd like to share it with you all.

Earlier we were discussing webrings, and I've created something I think will satisfy some (not all, but you can't please everybody) people's ideas of how a webring would work. I'm calling it an &quot;orbit&quot; (in keeping with the space theme), and the basic idea is pages that want to participate link to a special page that redirects people to the last page, the next page, or even a random page in the orbit. I've also created a software setup for doing it, and a public version people can join.

Introducing LEO, a public orbit that anyone* can join: all you have to do is follow the instructions at <A HREF="gemini://tilde.team/~khuxkm/leo/,">gemini://tilde.team/~khuxkm/leo/,</A> and whenever GUS catches on that you've linked to LEO, you should be added to the list! Along with the release of LEO, I'm also releasing Molniya, the code which runs LEO, so that others can start their own orbits without having to worry about coding it themselves.

(*) People who are blocked by GUS or are not indexed by GUS for some reason *can* join LEO but it's a more involved process that involves emailing me. Luckily, if you're not blocked by GUS you can add your capsule to GUS's index pretty easily.

Just my two cents,
Robert &quot;khuxkm&quot; Miles
