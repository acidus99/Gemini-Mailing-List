</I>
  Do you have any links to this?  I don't remember seeing any of that, and
I'd be interested in reading it.

&gt;<i> Just sayin', yes, it's trivial because you chose (whether by design or
</I>&gt;<i> inadvertantly) a framework upon which to support TLS, while in practice,
</I>&gt;<i> the implementation for others isn't necessarily so straight-forward ;)
</I>
  By design.  I knew libtls, written by the OpenBSD people, was designed to
make using TLS simple to use, and hard to use incorrectly.  Since my prerred
language is Lua, it was a simple matter to wrap up libtls for use in Lua
and a moderate amount of work to get it working within a network event
driver.  I happen to agree with the OpenBSD guys that *using* crypto is too
hard.

  I'm just sad that libtls doesn't seem to get much use.  But it could be
that I haven't looked hard enough.  I don't know.
  
&gt;<i> Question: Isn't it (even if non-trivial) possible, to account for other
</I>&gt;<i> methods of encryption by the listening daemon, some servers being able
</I>&gt;<i> to secure communications by one or another method if the upcoming
</I>&gt;<i> clients can also support those technologies?
</I>
  In general?  Yes.  In practice, with current implementations of TLS?  I
don't know, I haven't looked into it.

  But to remind you, I'm not the one who developed the Gemini protocol.
