<PRE>Okay, I'm going to update the spec-spec this weekend to replace the
current RFC-1896 text wrapping with the new &quot;wrap long lines but don't
join short lines&quot; approach with everybody seems either to agree is an
improvement or to feel indifferent about, and which nobody objected to
for the past week or so either on this list or to me directly.

My plan is to replace the entirety of section 1.3.5.3 with the below.
Does anybody want to suggest any minor changes to this text to remove
ambiguity or anything like that?

Cheers,
Solderpunk

```
1.3.5.3 Text display

Textual content for Gopher is typically &quot;hard-wrapped&quot;, i.e. composed
of lines no longer than (typically) 80 characters.  Each line of text
is printed to the screen as-is.  In contrast, in HTML content on the
web, browsers ignore the length of lines of text and instead &quot;reflow&quot;
text to a width appropriate for the display device - lines of text in
a HTML file which are &quot;too long&quot; get split up, while consecutive
lines which are &quot;too short&quot; get joined together.  Gemini adopts a
strategy between these two approaches, designed to strike a balance 
between implementation complexity, flexibility of display width, and
support for common text formatting patterns.

Lines of text in a text/gemini document which are not link lines (i.e.
do not begin with &quot;=&gt;&quot;) which are longer than can fit on a client's
display device SHOULD be &quot;wrapped&quot; to fit, i.e. long lines should be
split (ideally at whitespace or at hyphens) into multiple consecutive
lines of a device-appropriate width.  Recall that text/gemini
processing is strictly line-based: the above wrapping is applied to
each line of text independently.  Multiple consecutive lines which
are shorter than the client's display device MUST NOT be combined.

Blank lines receive no special treatment: they are ordinary text
lines, with a display length of zero.  Thus, they fit on any
client's display device and never need to be wrapped.  Each
individual blank line in a text/gemini document MUST be rendered by
the client as an individual blank line.

In order to take full advantage of this method of text formatting,
authors of text/gemini content SHOULD avoid hard-wrapping to a
specific fixed width.  Most text editors can be configured to
&quot;soft-wrap&quot;, i.e. to write this kind of file while displaying the long
lines wrapped to fit the author's display device.

Authors who insist on hard-wrapping their content MUST be aware that
the content will display neatly on clients whose display device is as
wide as the hard-wrapped length or wider, but will appear with
irregular line widths on narrower clients.
