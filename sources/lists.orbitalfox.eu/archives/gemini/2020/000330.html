Yeah, I don't think this does it because not only does it complicate server
implementation, but it does so in a way that seeks to allow servers to learn
about clients.

That being said, as far as I'm concerned, literally anything at
all is preferable to hard-wrapping at 40 characters -- less than a quarter of
my *laptop* screen with a mid-size font; I can only imagine how it looks on an
actual monitor. Limiting lines to 5-6 words would seem to limit, on a
fundamental level, the types of content that can even be served over gemini.

Adding an arbitrary cap to line lengths purely so that a hypothetical
mobile client doesn't require 10-20 lines of wrapping code (code that
Google suggests already exists in the Android SDK and merely has to be
invoked) seems absurd to me, particularly when the wrapping itself is
trivial, and this is entirely because word-wrapping is considered
preferable to naive, occasionally-mid-word wrapping.

The argument I'm reading is that nobody would use a client that
occasionally wraps in the middle of words, and the gemini spec is
explicitly geared toward making client implementations as simple as
possible. 

I understand this, yet I think there exists a world of
difference between &quot;it should be trivial to write a client&quot;
and &quot;it should be trivial to write a client that formats
every line beautifully and that we would all love using,&quot;
particularly when the point of difference between the two is
whether or not some words are line-broken some of the time.

This is just my two cents, but I feel like that's
something that it makes more sense to leave up to
the client. The actual client-side process of
interacting with the server is still simple, but
printing it can be done in a simple way (wrap,
occasionally breaking words) or with a few lines
and a couple conditions to guard edge-cases (to
word-wrap).

I don't know, I understand that some arguments
in favor of a 40 character hard-wrap have been
made from a reading level, and I understand
them, but I don't think that justifies
hard-capping all lines at only a few words. If
you want to be able to speed-read lines, you
could write a client that word-wraps at 40
characters very, very easily. You could write a
client that flashes words at you one at a time
quickly like those speed-reading programs if you
want to take that idea to an extreme. But I feel
like this is a very drastic response to a
non-issue. Maybe I wouldn't feel so bad about it
if the limit being suggested weren't as puny as
40 characters. But no matter what the limit is,
there are still screens, or fonts, or what have
you, where any hard-wrapping solution does not
solve the problem. And if aesthetics are the
main concern, and we can't stomach a few split
words, then I really don't get why the best
solution is to squash every single gemini site
into the left 25% of our screens.

I'm sure whatever flagship gemini client
eventually emerges on top is going to be
beautiful and not wrap in the middle of
words, but I also don't think that the
spec should be specced based upon the
hypothetical flagship client -- client
implementation can be simple, and it
will no doubt remain so for gemini;
but flagship client implementation is
not, cannot, and will never be, for any
protocol.

I'm not trying to be insulting to
anyone, and I get that y'all will
likely disagree. I fully understand the
reasons behind what everyone in favor
of the 40 char limit is suggesting, but
I think that practically speaking, it's
not liveable for anyone trying to use
gemini, and it causes more problems
than it solves.
