<PRE>It was thus said that the Great <A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini">colecmac at protonmail.com</A> once stated:
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It's unfortunate they don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have an implementation, but as it stands right now, most Gemini clients
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; will not handle Unicode domain names at all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And I'm not seeing anyone else trying to update clients to do this, even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if in an exploratory nature. What? Are they just waiting for a decree?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So when are you going to update gemget and Amfora to support punycode?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've heard it's easy to do. Or are you waiting for a spec change first?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -spc (Seriously, I feel like I'm the only one doing anything here)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I am waiting for Solderpunk. On the subject of IDNs, it seems obvious
</I>&gt;<i> to me that punycode will accepted as the thing to do for DNS,
</I>
  And why would Solderpunk choose this if no one has bothered to even look
into the possible issues wit respect to coding?  

&gt;<i> and that
</I>&gt;<i> Unicode should be sent to the server, 
</I>
and that would be a breaking change on the protocol.  Just having the client
accept IRIs and send URIs wouldn't change the protocol.  But aside for me,
NO ONE bothered to even test this out!

&gt;<i> but some questions around certs
</I>&gt;<i> and normalization still remain. I've outlined them here[1].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose you're correct about being the only one doing anything, but I
</I>&gt;<i> don't feel like it makes sense to do anything yet. The solution is simple
</I>&gt;<i> code-wise (for IDNs), and so I don't feel the need to experiment, 
</I>
  And if it's so simple, why not do it? But I get it, you'd rather wait
until a yeah/nay decision is made.  I mean, who wouldn't like

	single digit resonse codes
	no client certificates
	a link line of [text|url]
	no virtual hosting
	a request format ala gopher (including TABs!)
	no rediection
	no indication of pages are actually gone vs not found
	no MIME parameters

  That's pretty much what the Gemini spec *would have been* had some people
*cough cough* not bothered with doing any implementations.  But i get it. 
Bikeshedding with talk is easy, bikeshedding with an implementation is
tedious.
