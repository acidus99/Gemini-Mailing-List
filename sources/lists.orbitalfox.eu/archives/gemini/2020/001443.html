The adjustment made to the bullet item format is an admission that in-line
formatting text is a thing. Writers MAY de-facto influence rendering,
otherwise you wouldn't have needed to make the amendment.

Before, writers could not reproach the clients' behaviour w.r.t to
interpreting asterisks, because nothing in the specification hinted that
it was acknowledged by the standard.

Now, clients MAY highlight \*\S.*\* patterns. The specification was amended
to make sure no ambiguous cases occur with bullet item lines.

Which means that clients who do choose to implement emphasising will be
asked for a way NOT to emphasise ALL such patterns, because the specification
never implied that was a thing, originally. But they are left with a
gaping hole, in the current state of the specification.

It follows that there should be a way for writers to escape asterisks around
words, in non pre-formatted blocks.
