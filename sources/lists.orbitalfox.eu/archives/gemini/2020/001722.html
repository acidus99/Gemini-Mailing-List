  As someone who runs their own email server [1], and set up my blog to
accept posts via email [2], I think I'm in a unique position to comment
credibly on this topic.

  It's a good idea, but there are issues to consider.  When I first added
email support to my blogging engine (back in 2001, 2002?) I often wondered
why no other blogging engine copied the idea.  I mean, the user can use
their own proferred method of editing, and email clients exist for just
about everything under the sun, but no.  That feature remains a very niche
feature, and I think I finally figured out why---NO ONE BLODDY WELL RUNS
THEIR OWN EMAIL SERVER ANYMORE! [3]

  Ahem.  Sorry.

  But it's true.  Due to a lot of reasons I outlined in another email,
running a server is a pain, and email is especially painful because of all
the *other* things you have to do in addition to running an SMTP server. 
Now, aside the usual problem when running a server for a well known service,
I will say that setting up a &quot;receive-only&quot; email server (for the express
purpose of updating content) is vastly easier than a &quot;full service email
server&quot;, so that's a positive.

  The next issue is hooking up the processing into the email server.  This
is not really an issue as any MTA (Postfix is great, there are others, but
trust me on this---avoid sendmail [4] at all costs) can do this.  The MTA I
use makes this trivial---just add an entry to /etc/aliases that looks like:

localaddress: &quot;|/program/to/handle -option1 -option2&quot;

  Done.

  Now the issue becomes one of validating the email.  The scheme I use for
my blog is not secure [5] but it hasn't been broken yet, mainly because it's
not worth the trouble to thwart it.  I use a special email address that's
never been published, and there are some checks I make on the incoming
email but nothing bullet-proof.  The program then knows how to add the entry
to my blog, but subsequent changes tend to require manual editing of the
file on the server [6].  

  Then you have to decide how the email is to be formatted for the system to
know what is being created, updated, deleted, etc.  I include the required
information (author, title, date, etc) of the post in the email body [7] and
as such, it's again, not bullet-proof since I'm the only one using it, so I
know what I can and can't do (and even then, I've been bitten by typos I've
made---sigh).  

  The relevant limits for SMTP is in RFC-5321, and are:

	1,000 bytes per line
	65,536 bytes maximum message size

  Of course, a server can support larger limits than these (and I would
suspect modern systems do, but I haven't tested this).  I've never had an
issue with sending posts, but then rarely do I have lines longer than 1,000
bytes [8].

  To address security concerns, some of the things that *could* be done
include:

	Use a custom email to accept emails, perhaps a custom one per user.

	Check the From: or Sender: header, do a DNS MX lookup on the domain
	portion, and cross reference that with the Received: headers.

	Check the DKIM-Signature: header (if it exists).

	Dive into the rabbit hole that is PGP.

  So that's my two-bits worth on this topic.  Good idea, but quite a bit of
work involved.

  -spc

[1]	Of course I would.

[2]	Of course I did.

[3]	Well, almost no one.

[4]	It is a nightmare.  The last time I worked with sendmail, the
	configuration file had a configuration file (I kid you not) and it's
	been the enevitable Swiss Cheese of secure programs over its entire
	history.

[5]	This is probably a mistake to announce on a public list, but I am
	aware of the ramifications of doing so.

[6]	I do not have a way to handle a modification of an existing entry
	via email, but that's a limitiation I have, not to the idea as a
	whole.

[7]	I could use email headers for some of this, but I was lazy at the
	time and found it easier to specify in the body.

[8]	The technique I use these days is to have a sentance fragment per
	line.  This allows me easier editing while composing the entry. 
	Here's a sample of the first two paragraphs of my reply written in
	this style.
