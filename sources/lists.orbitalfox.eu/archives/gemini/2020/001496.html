That's the real question isn't it? I don't feel strongly about this
either way but I'll share a couple of thoughts.

One place I previously used gopher was IP routed over VHF packet
radio. These links are 1200 baud simplex with an effective throughput
of some 80 B/s. I'm not saying gemini can or should care what weirdos
are doing with VHF radios, but it may one day find use in scenarios
where quantities much less then 1 MB matter. If you're using such a
slow link, you might have to waste quite a lot of time to realise that
you're getting an above-average amount of content, reducing the
effectiveness of a client-side threshold.

One way to offer more flexibility could be to use the second digit of
the &quot;2n&quot; response code as saying &quot;this content &gt;= 10^n bytes&quot;.

But I would raise no objections to maintaining the status quo, or to
adopting the three codes suggested here.

Cheers, Tom
