<PRE>(warning: rambly, but the last paragraph actually has a point I wanted to make)

I think we ought to reexamine why people bother with publishing changes to a written body of work in a syndication format.

First, let&#8217;s explicitly set aside podcasts and torrented-tv-showcasts.

Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but most feeds today that people subscribe to are ones that are connected to some sort of time-ordered publication &#8212; like a blog. An author writes a blog entry and then the blog software updates its most-recent-changes feed.

This sort of feed is:

- automatically generated by some preexisting software
- tied to a linearizable publishing flow

This isn&#8217;t the only kind of feed pipeline, though.

One of the things I wanted when starting my capsule was to _not_ have a blog or blog-generating software (like a static-site generator). Still, I wanted people to be able to have a computer automatically check back and see if I&#8217;d changed anything, so I figured I&#8217;d want _some_ kind of syndication format available to automated clients like CAPCOM and feed readers.

I&#8217;d written Atom. I&#8217;d also written things that generated Atom. While Prettier makes writing nice-looking Atom easier, I didn&#8217;t want to hand-write Atom myself.

Then I thought about JSON Feed. I never liked writing strict JSON (no comments, no trailing commas permitted), but I remembered that I have yj on my computers. This would let me write YAML (pleasant!) and generate JSON.

So I did just that, and now I have two lines in a Makefile for when I want to update the JSON version of the JSON Feed:

feed: feed.yaml
	cat feed.yaml | yj -i &gt; feed.json

(the -i pretty-prints the JSON instead of leaving it all on one line. I _like_ having this sort of thing be at least somewhat human-readable, even if it bloats the payload for feed readers a bit.)

Now then. Let&#8217;s look at my changelog feed so we can all talk about it:

version:       <A HREF="https://jsonfeed.org/version/1.1">https://jsonfeed.org/version/1.1</A>
title:         my changelog thing
language:      en-US
home_page_url: <A HREF="gemini://gemini.whatever.example">gemini://gemini.whatever.example</A>
feed_url:      <A HREF="gemini://gemini.whatever.example/feed.json">gemini://gemini.whatever.example/feed.json</A>

items:
-
  id: e98b2c33-0cde-4856-a0ea-8272005e3341
  url: <A HREF="gemini://gemini.whatever.example/">gemini://gemini.whatever.example/</A>
  content_text: Mention on the home page that I like ambient music.
  date_published: 2020-09-09T03:39:20Z
-
  id: 14f1a84c-df7e-43ce-b20c-5a40398188ef
  url: <A HREF="gemini://gemini.whatever.example/">gemini://gemini.whatever.example/</A>
  content_text: Added homepage.
  date_published: 2020-09-08T00:41:07Z

(I&#8217;ve set up a capsule. I haven&#8217;t quite managed to find hosting for it yet. Hence the .example TLD.)

I think we all want simplicity so we can get novice proto-nerds on board with Gemini, but I think it&#8217;s a minor hassle for a novice astronaut to manually write a correct JSON Feed feed for a changelog where any given page might show up repeatedly. Any given item&#8217;s `id` could just be a single number, but writing out a proper `date_published` in proper RFC 3339 is kind of a hassle unless you have a way to get the output of  date(1) in the proper format.

On the other hand, there are the various line-based gemtext file formats. I think that if we want to make yet another mini-format for link text, we ought to provide enough information so aggregators like CAPCOM and feed readers can tell when one page is being updated repeatedly.
