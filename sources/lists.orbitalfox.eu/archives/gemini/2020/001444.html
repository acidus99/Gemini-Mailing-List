How are clients supposed to render words that are censored with asterisks?

Consider:

*ssh*le

The spec was modified to make sure clients understand the above isn't a
bullet item. Therefore writers are indirectly allowed by the standard to
influence the rendering, otherwise there would have been no conflict to
address in the first place.

So clients will render the above as &quot;sshle&quot;, which isn't the writer's
intent. Only a matter of time until you see writers start escaping asterisks
in texts:

\*ssh\*le

And now, because you've put the responsibility of dealing with a concept
that the standard implies is allowed, some clients will render the above
either verbatim, or have a concept of escaping, the latter being against
the philosophy of Gemini, from what I gather.

You can't pretend clients will fill-in the gaps by themselves if the
specification isn't pedantic about it.
