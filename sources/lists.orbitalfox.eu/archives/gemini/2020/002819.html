<PRE>&gt;<i> Requests, in no particular order:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - The link-color/background color contrast is a little low in dark mode. I generally don&#8217;t have issues with contrast, but link text is a bit dark to read easily. Could you make the link text a bit lighter?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Add titles to the buttons. Right now, when I turn on Voice Control (&#8220;hey Siri, turn on Voice Control&#8221;) and say &#8220;show names&#8221; the buttons on the bottom have names like &#8220;Arrow.clockwise&#8221;. Could these be changed to &#8220;Back&#8221;, &#8220;Forward, &#8220;Reload&#8221;, &#8220;Share&#8221;, and &#8220;Settings&#8221; (what both Overcast and PCalc use)?
</I>
Definitely.

&gt;<i> - swipe-from-edge behavior to go back and forward
</I>
This is slightly more complicated, as I&#8217;m not using the normal iOS mechanisms that would provide this behavior, but I&#8217;ll look into it.

&gt;<i> - Consider having a minimum 44-point height for links (this may be ugly and/or a lot of work to not be ugly). While almost all links are two rows high on my 1st-generation iPhone SE, most links are only one line on my 10.5&#8243; iPad when it&#8217;s in landscape mode. It&#8217;s kind of tough to aim for a single line on, say, CAPCOM when any given link has two close-by neighbors. For one way to do this sort of thing, have a look at the screenshot associated with &#8220;The Best Comments Experience&#8221; on <A HREF="https://apolloapp.io/">https://apolloapp.io/</A> &#8212; the currently-being-swiped comment is basically all one link, but there&#8217;s a nice, easy-to-hit button for it. (For Gemini, having the link _be_ that minimum-height button would probably be best, since we don&#8217;t have to worry about a bunch of consecutive words in a sentence being separate links.)
</I>
Absolutely.

&gt;<i> - I visited &lt;<A HREF="gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/users/adiabatic/tracker.webp?on=/">gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/users/adiabatic/tracker.webp?on=/</A>&gt; and the error message got ellipsis-truncated, not wrapped. I had to rotate my phone 90&#176; to read the entire message. (I&#8217;m not sure _why_ it failed, but WebP is the new kid on the block when it comes to WebKit support. I blame its newness.)
</I>
I&#8217;ll look into the error message being truncated, but WebP isn&#8217;t supported at all by iOS.

&gt;<i> - Fix the share-button crash that seems to happen only on my iPad (Apple should get those crash reports to you; if not, ping me and I&#8217;ll see if I can dig them out of my iPad the old-fashioned way).
</I>
I haven&#8217;t seen that crash report, but I know what the issue is.

&gt;<i> - Aim assist (that&#8217;s what console FPS players call it, at least; Apple seems to call it &#8220;Magnetism&quot;) doesn&#8217;t seem to work for trackpad cursors. That is, the proxy fingertip won&#8217;t snap to the outline of the bottom-bar buttons like it will for Safari&#8217;s buttons. You can (kinda) see this effect on <A HREF="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211008">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211008</A> on the second screenshot, er, screenmovie.
</I>
Definitely doable.

&gt;<i> Once again, Rocketeer is absolutely wonderful. Thank you again for making it.
</I>
Thanks, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re enjoying it! I&#8217;ll try to push a new beta later today with fixes for most of these.
