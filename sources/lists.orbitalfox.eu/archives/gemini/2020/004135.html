<PRE>Dear Gemini fans,

It is well-established that, in 2020, a technology cannot be said to
be &quot;for hipsters&quot; unless someone is using it to run an e-zine. Since I
don't know of anyone who does that with Gemini, and I do not wish to
Hacker News to be disappointed with us, I took it upon myself to run
an e-zine on Gemini.

I am therefore writing to tell you about Smog: the Saturday MOrning
Gemzine. Smog is an independent, non-commercial, tech-focused but
non-tech-curious zine that seeks to encourage its readers to share
their ideas, to make new things and tinker with old ones, and to
challenge the publishing culture that's currently prevalent on the
WWW. It is likely to be labeled as either pointless or uselessly
contrarian by the Silicon Valley audience -- that was not deliberate
but we can't change it now, and Smog is too big to fail.

Smog is published at:

<A HREF="gemini://gemini.trans-neptunian.space/~smog/">gemini://gemini.trans-neptunian.space/~smog/</A>

and you can read its first issue here:

<A HREF="gemini://gemini.trans-neptunian.space/~smog/20201219-SmogIssue1.gmi">gemini://gemini.trans-neptunian.space/~smog/20201219-SmogIssue1.gmi</A>

The first issue is deliberately slim and devoid of grand statements of
vision (or even tiny ones). Given the ephemeral nature of most
e-zines, I figured it's best to save those for the second issue.

Smog is published weekly. News and announcements will be present in
every issue. Every fourth issue will be slightly bigger than the other
ones and will include more reviews, tutorials and stories.

I will gladly publish letters from my readers, and will gladly publish
or re-publish any technical or non-technical articles that might be of
interest to the community. There are a few more details inside if
you're curious.

As a cultural hunch/experiment of sorts, I'm also running ads in Smog,
with a few catches: ads are ran for free, they're text-only but I
encourage clever ASCII hacks, and calls for donations &amp; co. will
always get priority.

Please excuse any obvious hosting/server protocol compliance
problems. They will be remedied swiftly as soon as someone lets me
know about them -- if there are any, it's only because yours truly has
been lurking Gemini space for about an year and a half now but hasn't
*actually* tried hosting anything on Gemini before!

Thank you very much for your attention, and fingers crossed that the
second issue of Smog will have more than one reader even without me
spamming this list!
