My business these last few months has been redressing websites to comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards as a result of lawsuits in the US filed under the ADA. Color contrast is only one small part of that, but let me assure you it is having very real financial impact on businesses right now. While a personal website may not be a target for litigation, following these standards is something we should all strive for if it is within our means.

With regard to color schemes, if you are not yourself very good at design it may be helpful to know you can find and generate color palettes using Adobe's Color website, which will also give guidance on accessibility. <A HREF="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility">https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility</A>

Furthermore, both Chrome and Firefox have means of seeing the WCAG color contrast ratios using their respective inspectors. AAA is great, but shoot for AA at least.

And finally, let me say that since this is about the Gemini website on circumlunar in particular, Solderpunk, if you find this stuff difficult or tedious or otherwise don't have time for it gimme a holler and I'll see what I can do to help.
