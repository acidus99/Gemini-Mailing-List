I think hijacking the &lt;META&gt; is unnecessary for my application. I can accomplish
the same thing by sending a &quot;30 TEMPORARY REDIRECT&quot; to all unauthenticated
requests, and then hitting them with a 61 after they have been redirected to
the path scope. I concede that this wouldn't be *exactly* the same because the
client won't end up at the page that they originally requested. But it's
workable enough for me. And I like having the meta available for human readable
error messages.

Any complexity that we can remove from the spec surrounding client certificates
is a strong positive. I'm in favor of deprecating the 61 and 21 status codes.
Drop &quot;64 FUTURE CERTIFICATE REJECTED&quot; and &quot;65 EXPIRED CERTIFICATE REJECTED&quot;
while you're at it, they can be subsumed by &quot;63 CERTIFICATE NOT ACCEPTED&quot;.

Heck, drop client certificates from the gemini specification all together.
Judging by the lack of client support so far, it's becoming clear that either:

1. They're a pain to implement compared to the rest of the specification
2. There's not much interest in actually using them

I get the vision behind the transient client sessions and fingerprinting stuff,
and it really is a nice idea. But it's also very prescriptive and unproven.
It sticks out when compared to the rest of the spec, which mostly borrows from
tried-and-true patterns already seen in gopher/WWW.

Best,
Michael
