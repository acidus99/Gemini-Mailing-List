I'm not necessarily opposed to sharing GUS' index, and will think
through it more. I do have a few concerns that come to mind
immediately though, about which I'm curious what people think.

* PRIVACY: a lot of folks around here seem to care a lot about it. In
  the current state of Gemini, everything created in Geminispace has a
  fairly high degree of anonymity through obscurity without even
  trying. If I release the index to the world, then it's easy for
  people to do things like search it for email addresses. Or use it to
  create a Gemini archive. People have expressed concern about that in
  the past, because it doesn't give users the agency to take down
  their own content - and now, by whitelisting GUS in their
  robots.txt, they're also implicitly whitelisting those use-cases.

* OVERCOMPLICATION: if I just made a way to enter regex in
  GUS itself, then we could probably all answer the great majority of
  these questions, on demand, without having to download anything, or
  learn the schema, or figure out how to grep it (it's not a standard
  &quot;database&quot; so figuring out how to grep it is actually non-trivial).
  Adding regex support feels pretty compelling to me, because GUS *is*
  essentially an open index

In the meantime, please do feel free to email me and chat about any
index questions you're having trouble answering. In the case of the
unordered list discussion, I just wrote some regex to collect relevant
numbers, and will post them to the other thread!

Yours faithfully,
Natalie
