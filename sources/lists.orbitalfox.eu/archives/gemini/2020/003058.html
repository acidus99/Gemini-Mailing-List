I'd say that's precisely the point -- Gemini is built for the serving of text files.. It'd be like (pardon the HTTP-only metaphor) if you decided to tweet out the contents of /War and Peace/ -- you could do it, but why would you want to?

&gt;<i>

</I>
I agree that there's not enough of a use case for a Content-Length: header -- see above on the purpose of Gemini.  I mean, people can host whatever they'd like (I love the Konpeito mixtapes as much as anyone, for example), but I don't think anyone should *expect* to easily download large files from Gemini capsules.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> New people will join and ask for a content length header again in a few 
</I>&gt;<i> months. It has happened before, more than once, in this very young 
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list. If we would have a supporting specification which deals 
</I>&gt;<i> with this, we would have something to point at.
</I>
There was some talke about adding something addressing Content-Length in the FAQ, which I 1000% support.
