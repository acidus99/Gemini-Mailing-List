In my humble opinion, this extends to TLS too. Tell a beginner about
asymmetric cryptography and how it can be used to negotiate a key for
symmetric cryptography, and they will understand the general concept of TLS
and thus &quot;grasp Gemini without pain&quot;.

I remember a Python core developer coming up with a nice motto for a
&gt;<i> Python conference many years ago: &quot;It fits my brain&quot;.  Gemini, without
</I>&gt;<i> TLS fits my brain.  A bicycle, even an old car may fit my brain. A

I have two issues with this argument. The first one is that whoever uses
it, uses their brain as the golden standard. The second one is that it
assumes that &quot;basic networking&quot; is easy to understand.

I once spent weeks and weeks in low-level TCP debugging at my day job, and
obviously trying to learn whatever I can to facilitate the work. After long
days of reading RFCs and investigating Wireshark dumps, I still can't say I
understand TCP (let alone IP or Ethernet, let alone the complete network
stack). I once researched what it would take to implement an ethernet
adapter on an FPGA and it's a huge amount of work.

I've never taken a freewheel or a derailleur apart, yet I fully understand
how they work. TCP/IP I've spent man-months on, yet I only have a surface
understanding.

***

Sorry if this comes off as rude or argumentative. I do see the point of the
&quot;fits my brain&quot; concept, and am actively trying to fit stuff into my brain.
I do understand wanting Gemini without TLS; I just don't agree with the
goal nor with these arguments.

IMHO there would be room for a really simple, really low-latency text
protocol. Gopher over UDP, maybe? But that's another experiment.
