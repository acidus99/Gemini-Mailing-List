I've never stated it that way before. :)  My own understanding of these
things clarifies over time in response to other people's ideas about the
direction things should take.  For which I am grateful!

&gt;<i> Please note that my initial post was just a question: &quot;Is this Mercury

Duly noted!  I guess my reply was, implicitly, addressed at various
folks who expressed disapproval of the TLS idea at various times.

No need!
 
&gt;<i> BTW I loved your &quot;vegans carrying loads of USB keys on their bikes&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Good one! :-)
</I>
I'm not even sure I was joking!  If we genuinely want to minimise
&quot;Environmental Damage Units&quot; per byte transferred per metre per second,
where EDU is a vague all-encompassing measure which incorporates CO2
emissions, consumption of non-renewable resources, etc., I don't doubt
that there are certain combinations of payload size and distance where
&quot;bikenet&quot; is actually quite competitive, especially if you replace the
USB keys with 1TB hard drives.  A plant-based diet would undeniably
help decrease the EDU total, but it may not even be necessary to
outcompete higher tech solutions.  It gets even better if you consider
that the bike is a general-purpose tool which could also transport food,
medicine, etc. at the same time...

&gt;<i> I didn't know that. I guess this is why I asked on the mailing list. I
</I>&gt;<i> do understand now that it is a touchy subject. I am sorry for the
</I>&gt;<i> noise.
</I>
No need to apologise, really!

Cheers,
Solderpunk
