<PRE>It was thus said that the Great nervuri once stated:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I know, with TLSv1.2 client certs are sent in the clear,
</I>&gt;<i> revealing login information to the ISP (and whoever else is looking). In
</I>&gt;<i> this respect, when used with TLS 1.2, client certs are worse than cookies.
</I>
  I currently log client certificates (gasp!).  Yes, it's true, but I added
such logging last year when the protocol was still in the intial stages of
development and I wanted a way to debug client certificate issues.  I have
an area that requires client certificates but it doesn't get a lot of
traffic.  But, just bacause I'm feeling ornery about this, here are the
details of the few client certs that have crossed my server over the past
month (the subject):

	/CN=elpherAyKLzp
	/CN=default
	/CN=My Cert
	/C=CH/ST=Some-State/O=Internet Widgits Pty Ltd
	/CN=testuser
	/C=US/ST=FL/L=Boca Raton/CN=Sean Conner/emailAddress=<A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini">sean at conman.org</A>

and except for that last one (what a stupid git, giving out his name and
email address like that!), the issuer was also the same as the subject.

  Yeah, way worse than cookies I'd say.

&gt;<i> Also, 1.2 isn't compatible with encrypted SNI. So I hope it will be phased
</I>&gt;<i> out soon, if possible. Let me know your thoughts.
</I>
  Sigh.

  Given the current state of Gemini, *even if* the domain name were
encrypted, there's still a near 80% chance of knowing which domain is being
accessed, just because most servers only serve one domain.  And there is
*no* login information in a server certificate.

  -spc (You know, a pair of scissors to the network cable does wonders for
	security ... )
