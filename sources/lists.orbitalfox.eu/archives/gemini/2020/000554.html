<PRE>Hi Dave,
Funny to see this on the mailing list this morning as I was reading through your work just last night. Really great stuff!

I cannot speak for the other client maintainers, but I can give some info for my client (Bombadillo):

All major and minor versions, but not patch versions, are available as pre-compiled binaries from the website or gopher (bombadillo.colorfield.space in either case), for Linux-32, Linux-64, OSX-64, and I believe we have a BSD build up as well but do not quote me on that (we do not support Windows at present).

I was told someone has a build up in the Arch AUR as well. I am not an Arch user and have not been able to verify what version they are at or if they are actively maintaining it.

I would love to see it packaged for other distros. Steve, in a response to the OP, mentions OpenSuse having a good build system. I may have to look into that. I'm not sure I have the time to devote to maintaining the codebase as well as packaging for multiple distros, but I'd definitely give it a try for at least Debian. I may wait until the next minor release as I have some gemini-specific improvements that should be releasing in the near future. I'd love any advice people have re: packaging as I am very new to trying to do so (I usually just build everything from source when possible).

As far as building goes, for those users with the desire to try, Bombadillo will compile with a Go compiler for 1.11 or newer. It uses no packages outside of the standard library and comes with a makefile (sudo make install, and you should be good to go).
