I see better now what the alternative suggestions are, thanks.

I still think a robust client has to in all likelihood anticipate both 
CRLF and LF. There will be a range of servers out there and just getting 
the content of the file sent to you isnt going to be unusual. Probably 
plain Mac/CR is too ancient to be widely found, but see below.

Another consideration that comes to me now is for any applications of 
Gemini that might require a binary correct transfer of a text file from 
A to B. For example if we are gemini as a content transfer layer for a 
source code repository. There is already a Git over gemini service which 
seems interesting. In these scenarios as the end user, you would expect 
that a GMI file served to you from the repo was the same as it is on the 
server. So I think we should support all &quot;normal&quot; plain text formats as 
the response body and not in general have the server munging or 
adjusting them.

Best Wishes
