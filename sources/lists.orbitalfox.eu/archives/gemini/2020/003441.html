Timestamps are not human readable


Lots and lots of people around the world are extremely used to dates
written 2020-11-19, notably in China where it is the national standard.
It's very easy for U.S. folks to interpret as a variant of their
11/19/2020, and probably not all that much work for Europeans (yes, the UK
is in Europe, just like Switzerland) with their 19/11/2020 either, as it is
consistently big-endian whereas the native format is consistently
little-endian.  A number of countries are switching over, at least for
official purposes.

I think it is very important that timestamps are sent in Universal Time
only.  Resolving local times, especially after the fact, is a Very Big Deal
involving a complex C library and timezone data files that change at least
once a year and typically more often.

But I do favor standard punctuation, so I would support the following fixed
format:  2020-11-19T18:12:00Z where Z means Universal Time.  20
characters.  Period.  If you don't have time information, use 00:00:00Z.

Feed aggregators should probably add the feed name in square brackets after
the date and before the title, so that the user can peruse the &quot;Famous
Foovians&quot; feed while ignoring links to the &quot;Foovian Politicians&quot; gemlog,
say.  This would be obtained from the first-level heading in the feed
file.  The only reason for standardizing the square brackets is so as not
to have two entries on second-level aggregations.
