<PRE>Hi Sean

Thanks for the new tests - I just ran them on GemiNaut.

I believe my client GemiNaut is doing the right thing for all of them. 
But this is because I'm using a system web browser control to do the 
hard work of the text rendering. Apart from the ones mentioned below 
which I disagree with, it wraps them all as I would expect.

The only quibble I would have with the tests is the ones with no spacers 
at all (43, 46 and 49). I don't agree that the client should try to 
hyphenate the words. Doing so is a non-trivial problem and for a real 
language is very language specific (where are the syllable boundaries 
perhaps). So the correct thing to do is to simply lay them out in a 
non-wrapped line. I don't think there could be any authority about how 
to wrap an arbitrary sequence of unicode points? If there is such a 
thing please say.

So I think for those tests, you should say that the client should not 
crash, but should display either a) as a wrapped link (wrapped any old 
how for those clients that insist on forcing a wrap, perhaps on mobile 
or b) as a single unwrapped line with a scrolling mechanism.

A suggestion for a possible improvement - it would be helpful if there 
was a &quot;back to tests index&quot; link on each page, that way you can choose a 
few tests from the index, then go back to the index when you are done - 
otherwise you might have to go back N times, which is not quite as nice.

Best Wishes

  - Luke
