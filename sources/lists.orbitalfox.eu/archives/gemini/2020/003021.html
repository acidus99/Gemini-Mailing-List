I assume the majority of people who suggest a feature want &quot;gemini + X&quot;,
but everyone has their own idea of what X is :) If everyone built their own
protocol instead, almost all of those would be doomed from the get-go. To
get traction a potential new protocol needs to be appealing to as many as
possible -- and the creator needs to *reach out* to as many as possible at
that!

The most sold pie in the US is apple pie. It's pretty much nobody's
favourite, but it's virtually everyone's second-favourite.

The fact that so many feature proposals drop in suggests that Gemini has
done mostly everything right and appeals to a whole truckload of people.
It's a good thing, and it doesn't mean people *aren't* getting creative
with what they have (see
<A HREF="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/mozz.us/files/rfc_gemini_favicon.gmi">https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/mozz.us/files/rfc_gemini_favicon.gmi</A> for
example). The lack of content-size or hash is by no means a deal-breaker
for me; I'll find other ways to reduce bandwidth usage for my use case if
need be. But that doesn't mean it *wouldn't be useful*, for my use case or
others'.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, if all I want is gemini + X, then using protocol Y with its bloat of
features I *don't* need is less tempting than sending a feature proposal to
the gemini ML. And again, that's a good thing! It means people are engaging
and shaping the trajectory of their own internet future. A rejected
proposal is a hundred times better than one that was never discussed for
fear of ridicule or social repercussions. The community is alive and
vibrant :D
