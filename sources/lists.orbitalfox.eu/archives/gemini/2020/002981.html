</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this is true. Would that cause an issue? In that case calling it &quot;x-gemi-content-length&quot; should resolve it, as the &quot;x-&quot; prefix is for experimental types and any receiver that doesn't recognize it will ignore it. I'm aware that it still doesn't convey info on the *type* of content, and thereby doesn't belong among MIME type info, but it's a compromise I'm willing to make.

If you&#8217;re worried whether the occasional big(gish) file transferred correctly and don&#8217;t want to stand up an HTTP server, have you considered publishing SHA-256 or -512 hashes, like one does for Linux-distribution .iso files?
