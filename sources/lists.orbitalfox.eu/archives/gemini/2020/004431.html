  It was interesting to see the Go URL library you linked to.  For your two
examles, it will return the following structures:

	{
	  Path    = &quot;Research/A/B Testing/Results&quot;,
	  RawPath = &quot;Research%2FA%2FB%20Testing%2FResults&quot;,
	}

	{
	  Path    = &quot;Research/A/B Testing/Results&quot;,
	  RawPath = &quot;Research/A%2FB%20Testing/Results&quot;,
	}

and it's up to the client to check RawPath if it's *really* necessary to
make the distinction (meaning---the client *still* has to parse the path).

  A more normal example like &quot;Research/ABTesting/Results&quot; will result in:

	{
	  Path    = &quot;Research/ABTesting/Results&quot;,
	  RawPath = &quot;&quot;,
	}

so it's not like RawPath will always have the path.

  For the record, my own URL parsing library will just return 

	Research/A/BTesting/Results

for both samples.  I found it easier to work with that than what I was doing
at the time (pedantically correct, painfully hard to use in practice). You
would be hard pressed to actually create a file named &quot;A/B Testing&quot; on any
file system I know of (and not have it be &quot;B Testing&quot; in the &quot;A&quot; directory). 
If there *is* a file system that allows slashes in a filename (and not just
a seperator between directories) than I might revisit my decision, but until
then ...
