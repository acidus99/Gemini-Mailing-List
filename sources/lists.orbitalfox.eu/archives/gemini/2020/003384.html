&gt;<i> path too, however if the author decided to handle such case, it'll be

  Citation needed.

  I'm sorry, this just isn't the case.  From the full ABNF in Appendix A:

   URI           = scheme &quot;:&quot; hier-part [ &quot;?&quot; query ] [ &quot;#&quot; fragment ]

   hier-part     = &quot;//&quot; authority path-abempty
                 / path-absolute 
                 / path-rootless 
                 / path-empty

   URI-reference = URI / relative-ref
   
   absolute-URI  = scheme &quot;:&quot; hier-part [ &quot;?&quot; query ]

   relative-ref  = relative-part [ &quot;?&quot; query ] [ &quot;#&quot; fragment ]

   relative-part = &quot;//&quot; authority path-abempty
                 / path-absolute
                 / path-noscheme
                 / path-empty 

[ NON-PATH RELATED RULES OMITTED FOR SPACE I REPEAT NON-PATH RELATED RULES OMITTED FOR SPACE ]

   path          = path-abempty    ; begins with &quot;/&quot; or is empty
                 / path-absolute   ; begins with &quot;/&quot; but not &quot;//&quot;
                 / path-noscheme   ; begins with a non-colon segment
                 / path-rootless   ; begins with a segment
                 / path-empty      ; zero characters

   path-abempty  = *( &quot;/&quot; segment )
   path-absolute = &quot;/&quot; [ segment-nz *( &quot;/&quot; segment ) ]
   path-noscheme = segment-nz-nc *( &quot;/&quot; segment )
   path-rootless = segment-nz *( &quot;/&quot; segment )
   path-empty    = 0&lt;pchar&gt;

  The path parsing rules state a single slash.  Not '/'+, nor '/'*, but a
single '/'.  The only place where more than a single slash is allowed PER
THE @#%@#$@$ ABNF is just prior to the authority, which contains the
hostname.  THE ONLY PLACE!  

  I will also draw your attention to the URI-reference rule, which is there
for some reason, which allows both a full URI, or a RELATIVE URI, which
means that

		//example.com/path/to/resource

IS A VALID URI!  IT IS NOT A HACK!  What part of the ABNF do you not
understand?

&gt;<i> handled just fine, you can have your parser treat the text before the
</I>&gt;<i> first occurrence of '/' as host subcomponent of authority component if
</I>&gt;<i> scheme is not specified just like you have your parser treat the first
</I>&gt;<i> occurrence of '/' after the &quot;//&quot; prefix as host subcomponent in the
</I>&gt;<i> current way of handling schemeless requests in Gemini, the Gemini
</I>&gt;<i> protocol requires passing full URL in requests, therefore, such should
</I>&gt;<i> not be interpreted as path because Gemini requests don't allow path
</I>&gt;<i> without stating host.
</I>
  No, the spec allows both the full URI, and a relative URI as long as it
starts with '//' (it has the authority section).  The wording in the spec is
bad and should be changed to clarify it, but that's the current
specification.  

  Again,

		//example.com/path/to/resource

IS NOT A HACK!

&gt;<i> So yeah, I'm not changing my mind, &quot;//example.tld&quot; is a hack because
</I>&gt;<i> that is not a valid URI and &quot;//&quot; is supposed to be only present when
</I>&gt;<i> scheme is specified, however, &quot;example.tld&quot; is while discouraged,
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable for this use case and the RFC even acknowledged it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me quote to you why it is that RFC 3986 discourages its use:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Although this practice of using suffix references is common, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be avoided whenever possible and should never be used in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; situations where long-term references are expected.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of Gemini requests, they are not a 'long-term' reference,
</I>&gt;<i> they're one-time requests, I don't see any downside to not doing it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Last I checked, if you connect to <A HREF="gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space">gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and request &quot;gemini.circumlunar.space/&quot; you get an error. You may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; however request &quot;//gemini.circumlunar.space/&quot; and get the appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 20 response. Should gemini.circumlunar.space be considered to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; running a canonical implementation of Gemini?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You shouldn't look at any particular implementation as a reference for
</I>&gt;<i> the spec, 
</I>
  I believe Philip used gemini.circumlunar.space because that's the server
written by solderpunk, author of the specification.  

&gt;<i> I'm assuming gemini.circumlunar.space is running molly-brown,
</I>
  Also written by solderpunk.  The bastard!  Writing a Gemini server that
doesn't follow his specification!

&gt;<i> do you know that molly-brown treats single '\n' as valid request
</I>&gt;<i> terminators instead of explicit '\r\n'? (see:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/molly-brown/src/branch/master/handler.go#L138">https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/molly-brown/src/branch/master/handler.go#L138</A>),
</I>&gt;<i> do you know that if a transaction is finished, molly-brown waits for
</I>&gt;<i> the client to close the connection instead of closing it from the
</I>&gt;<i> server side, is that spec compliant?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The reason I think molly-brown accepted &quot;//example.tld&quot; in the first
</I>&gt;<i> place is because the Go standard library URL parser implementation
</I>&gt;<i> accepted this, I don't know if this was a bug or it is intended design,
</I>
  It's by design---see the ABNF above.  

&gt;<i> but that's what it is, other URI parsers that are more strict with
</I>&gt;<i> compliance to the RFC will refuse to parse a URI without scheme
</I>&gt;<i> present, 
</I>
  If it does, it's broken by design.  Again, see the ABNF above.

&gt;<i> here is an excerpt from the library's documentation that might
</I>&gt;<i> give an idea of how they treat URLs:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A URL represents a parsed URL (technically, a URI reference).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The general form represented is:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [scheme:][//[userinfo@]host][/]path[?query][#fragment]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; URLs that do not start with a slash after the scheme are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interpreted as:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scheme:opaque[?query][#fragment]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Notice that [scheme:] is enclosed in brackets implying that it is
</I>&gt;<i> optional, while [//host] is optional too, the &quot;//&quot; is considered a part
</I>&gt;<i> of the authority component by the Go URL parser implementation, this is
</I>&gt;<i> why &quot;//example.tld&quot; is accepted while &quot;example.tld&quot; is not, try passing
</I>&gt;<i> both strings to url.Parse() and see what you get.
</I>
  Yes, exactly.  Again, that's per the ABNF above.  Why do you not get this? 
Here, have one more excerpt from RFC-3986, this time from section 3:

   The following are two example URIs and their component parts:

         <A HREF="foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose">foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose</A>
         \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
          |           |            |            |        |
       scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
          |   _____________________|__
         / \ /                        \
         urn:example:animal:ferret:nose

and the URL parsing library I have parses those as:

['<A HREF="foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose">foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose</A>'] =
{
  fragment = &quot;nose&quot;,
  query = &quot;name=ferret&quot;,
  path = &quot;/over/there&quot;,
  scheme = &quot;foo&quot;,
  port = 8042.000000,
  host = &quot;example.com&quot;,
}

['urn:example:animal:ferret:nose'] =
{
  path = &quot;example:animal:ferret:nose&quot;,
  scheme = &quot;urn&quot;,
}

and because I like belaboring the inanimate equus pleonastically:

[&quot;//example.com/path/to/resource&quot;] =
{
  host = &quot;example.com&quot;,
  path = &quot;/path/to/resource&quot;,
}

[&quot;/example.com/path/to/resource&quot;] =
{
  path = &quot;/example.com/path/to/resource&quot;,
}

[&quot;example.com/path/to/resource&quot;] =
{
  path = &quot;example.com/path/to/resource&quot;,
}

  You should try those with the Go URL parser you use and see what YOU get.
