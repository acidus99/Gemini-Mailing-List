<PRE>Hello guys, I am not normally one to get involved in the Gemini spec. I 
got into a discussion with Martin about how UTF-8 characters are 
supposed to be handled in links in Gemini documents.

On my site I have a link in a document like this:

=&gt; logarion/ta&#285;ikio--lando-montara.gmi Ta&#285;ikio: Lando Montara

This refers locally to the actual file name on the disk. The main 
question is, is this allowed in Gemini documents? I thought this should 
work because I believe that Gemini is UTF-8 native or by default, and my 
Unix file system (in this case FreeBSD UFS) appears to be in agreement.

The question is whether clients must support this as well, as in my 
experience so far all of them do but Martin's client seems to reject 
this link due to containing non-ASCII characters and doesn't handle it. 
He said that RFC3986 does not allow links to have non-ASCII characters, 
but perhaps this isn't relevant to Gemini's internal encoding and 
document format, but rather for exported URI's (ie made universal).

It does seem a proper URI should best contain %C4%9D in place of &#285;, but 
the question is whether I should change it in the document? Does the 
internal linking (in my case the link is local/relative) even count as a 
URI?

Ben
