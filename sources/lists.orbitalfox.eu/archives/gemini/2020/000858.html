Aaah, wonderful!  Thanks for bringing this to my attention.

I *had* been wondering whether or not mainstream webservers were doing
newline translation for text/html, which I had convinced myself they
should have been doing, in principle.

Okay, so we can actually spec whatever we like here for stuff that goes
over the wire. CRLF is only mandatory for &quot;canonical form&quot; (although if
that's not what is on the disk and not what is on the wire, what the
heck *is* it?).

So now the question is which do we prefer, forcing servers to
canonicalise (canonise?) everything, with client behaviour then being
strictly limited, or letting servers just send whatever the author uses
and forcing clients to accept any of CRLF, CR or LF?

In general I have preferred pushing burden to server authors over client
authors for Gemini...but I expect the client burden is pretty small here
as most languages will have some kind of functionality for breaking
strings into lines which already handles this...

Cheers,
Solderpunk
