<PRE>Hi Charles,

Welcome to the community!  I am glad that reading about Gemini sparked
your interest.

I have to admit, I was very apprehensive about learning that Gemini had
featured at HN.  In part simply because I feared too many people turning
up at once and this small, slow, &quot;human scale&quot; project being
overwhelmed.  Also, in part, because of a perceived cultural mismatch.
But so far actually I am very happy to see that the majority of the
response has been positive or at least constructive.  It's good to have
more people around!

Please don't take this the wrong way, but my hope is that once I've had
the time to put a bit more work into Molly-Brown, building a container
for it will be something very obviously not worth the time and trouble
required!  Containers make sense for complicated software with large and
fragile dependency networks, which is exactly the kind of thing Gemini
software should *not* be!  But I absolutely grant that in its current
just-barely-running state, where it doesn't daemonise itself and isn't
integrated with any init systems, and you have to manually create the
key/cert pair, there's enough of a barrier to entry that casually
interested people might be turned away.  If a container gets more people
setting up Gemini servers, that's only a good thing.

Cheers,
Solderpunk

</I>&gt;<i> I saw the front page item on Hacker News yesterday and was immediately intrigued by this project, and as I investigated a little, the community around it (which I had no idea existed).
