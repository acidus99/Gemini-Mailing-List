<PRE>It was thus said that the Great solderpunk once stated:

</I>
  I don't know about 80h, but I know I am.  I'm following the spec (what
there is of it) at

	<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20020403050958/http://python.ca/nas/scgi/protocol.txt">https://web.archive.org/web/20020403050958/http://python.ca/nas/scgi/protocol.txt</A>

(taken from the Wikipedia article about SCGI).  From what I can determine
(checking Wikipedia, the above article and the Apache documentation) it
appears that the Gemini server (or web server in the case of Apache) is
expecting the SCGI program to be running already, and all that happens is
the Gemini (Apache) server connects to it, sends the request and awaits a
response.

  The *only* example lists the following meta-variables (to use RFC-3875
terminology):

	CONTENT_LENGTH	(mandatory for SCGI)
	SCGI		(mandatory for SCGI)
	REQUEST_METHOD	(mandatory for CGI)
	REQUEST_URI	(not part of RFC-3875)

  I'm keeping *most* of the RFC-3875 meta-variables except for those that
don't really make sense, like GATEWAY_INTERFACE (since it's not),
SCRIPT_NAME (since it's not a script), PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED (again,
becuase it's not a script).  I am keeping REQUEST_METHOD, and for
REQUEST_URI I have GEMINI_URL and GEMINI_URL_PATH (these are now available
in my CGI interface as well).  I haven't added REQUEST_URI because it's
underspecced in my opinion---the example only shows the path portion, and I
have a workaround in place anyway.

  I was going to make SCGI support a handler (like all of my dynamic content
generators in GLV-1.12556) but that requires support in the config file and
thus leaves users out [1].  I then had an inspired thought (or evil, take
your pick) to use symbolic links in the filesystem pointing to the server

lrwxrwxrwx  1 spc spc 16 May 24 00:03 foo -&gt; <A HREF="scgi:////tmp/log">scgi:////tmp/log</A>
lrwxrwxrwx  1 spc spc 22 May 23 23:57 here -&gt; <A HREF="scgi://localhost:33333">scgi://localhost:33333</A>
lrwxrwxrwx  1 spc spc 22 May 23 23:58 there -&gt; <A HREF="scgi://[fc00::1">scgi://[fc00::1</A>]:3333/

  The first points to a Unix domain socket, the other two to TCP sockets. 
This will give users a way to use SCGI without having access to the config
files for the Gemini server.  I'm not saying everybody has to use this
symbolic hack for SCGI---it's just that I'm using this hack for SCGI support
in GLV-1.12556.  

  I'll report more on this when I have it finished.

  -spc

[1]	The CGI support in GLV-1.12556 is not a handler, but is a module
	used by the filesystem handler when it sees a file that is
	executable.  The userdirectory handler uses the filesystem handler,
	so the use of CGI is transfered to userdirectories as well.
