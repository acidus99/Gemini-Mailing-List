For what it's worth, the Rust standard library is designed to work
with both LF (&quot;\n&quot;) and CRLF (&quot;\r\n&quot;) line endings, but not CR alone
(&quot;\r&quot;):
<A HREF="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1212-line-endings.md">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1212-line-endings.md</A>

In the discussion that led to this, there was no real support for
supporting &quot;\r&quot; line endings, nor for other uncommon newlines like
U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR:
<A HREF="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1212">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1212</A>

I think text/gemini should allow both &quot;\n&quot; and &quot;\r\n&quot;. Requiring a
single style would either place a burden on content authors (on
servers that don't auto-convert line endings), or make servers more
complex and less efficient. (They would need to inspect every
text/gemini file and possibly transform it, rather than stream it
directly from disk to the network.)  Meanwhile, I think client
software can handle either option fairly simply.

For the protocol header, I don't have a strong opinion. Any choice we
make is fairly easy to implement in both server and client. However, I
have a slight preference for specifying just &quot;\n&quot; as the header
terminator. One byte is (marginally) more efficient than two, and in
some languages it's slightly simpler to split on a single-byte
delimiter.
