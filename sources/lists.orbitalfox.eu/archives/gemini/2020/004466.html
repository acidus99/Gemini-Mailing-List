&gt;<i> A lot of capsule content are gemlog posts of varying subjects. How would you like that to be categorized? I.e. if &lt;author&gt; has a gemlog and writes about movies, sports, and food, should there be just one link to the gemlog itself under &#8221;gemlogs&#8221;, a link to it under each of those categories, or a link to it under &#8221;gemlogs&#8221; and links to individual posts under categories they fit?
</I>
I guess the answer to categorization is that it'll be 'however I see fit'. but anyone submitting a link can suggest it's put where they think is best. I want this to be low effort, zero to-and-fro for anyone suggesting a link - just throw me a link, or put it where you think it goes in a patch. I'm not particularly interested in setting out rules and things around this, and I don't think they'd work. Sometimes a single post/page might be notable. Sometimes a link to the root of a capsule would be better. I'll do whatever I feel at the time :-)

Hopefully as I add links it'll basically show what I'm thinking, and prior to there being enough links for that I'll just move any suggestions as I see fit. My overriding goal with this is to have a place that just gets a bunch of links to interesting Gemini capsules 'out there'. It's a personal project that I'd love to get suggestions for, rather than a community project with aims, rules, etc. set out.

If it is at all useful and in the end someone takes the directory and makes it more structured, and that's better / more popular - well that'd be an excellent outcome.

Cheers,
