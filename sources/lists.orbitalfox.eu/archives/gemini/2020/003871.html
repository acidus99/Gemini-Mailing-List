Security might also mean knowing that I'm not unintendedly divulging
any details of my browsing habits to some unknown third party, or
knowing that no one can impersonate your server and pages to mislead
your readers. Neither of those necessarily involve client certificates
at all but are a real possibility when multiple code points can
represent similar or identical glyphs.

I can see how IRI and IDN may be a good idea in terms of including
languages with bigger or altogether different alphabets or
non-alphabets, but from the perspective of an implementer, it does add
a lot of complexity and opens up to homograph attacks in an area where
ASCII transliteration is already the norm. Some browsers deal with
homograph attacks by displaying punycode directly based on some basic
heuristic (e.g. when a hostname contains both cyrillic and latin codes).

I don't know much about IRI. Web browsers for example sort of skipped on
this standard in favor of the WHATWG URL spec.

Personally, I think some concessions need to be made to maintain the
simplicity of the protocol. The currently mandated standard is
(relatively) short and simple to implement, and transliteration is
already pervasive in the area of internet names and URIs. Octet
encoded ASCII does have the nice property that there are no homographs,
there's no normalization, there's nobidirectional text etc. and there
is no database of rules that have to be applied to handle these things.

That said, I think a lot can be improved on the client side without
changing the standard. Clients can optionally do the ToASCII/ToUnicode
dance and correspondingly automatically percent encode input and display
&quot;un-percented&quot; paths in some circumstances. The standard only specifies
what needs to be sent to the server to request a resource, and what
text/gemini documents need to contain to produce a link. This opens up
a lot of quality of life improvements on the user interface level.

RFC 4690 is a good read on the topic of IDNs.
