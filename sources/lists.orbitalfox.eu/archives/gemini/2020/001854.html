Hey Phil,

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have very recently discovered Gemini, so I am late at the party, but
</I>&gt;<i> very excited by the Gemini concept and philosophy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the same time, I am a bit disappointed by the mandatory use of TLS
</I>&gt;<i> in the protocol. It seems _so_ at odds with the overall philosophy and
</I>&gt;<i> simplicity of Gemini...  But I _do_ understand that there is momentum
</I>&gt;<i> behind TLS usage.
</I>
same and agreed

&gt;<i> Looking for discussion about this TLS issue, I found in a message by
</I>&gt;<i> Petite Abeille [1] a link to the Mercury document [2] by Solderpunk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know when it was published and couldn't find a discussion
</I>&gt;<i> about Mercury (i.e. Gemini without TLS)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I would like to know:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * is the Mercury document an old document that has been already
</I>&gt;<i> discussed and the concept discarded?  (any link to the discussion?)
</I>
If you search the geminiverse for mercury you'll see a few comments. I
found that there were mostly negative responses toward Mercury, but then
again it's a pretty small sample size.

&gt;<i> * is the concept still &quot;alive&quot;?  is the document still &quot;open for comments&quot;?
</I>
I don't see why there couldn't be another ecosystem around mercury. I
picture clients eventually supporting a suite of protocols, such as
gopher, mercury and gemini all at once.

&gt;<i> * are there Gemininauts interested in Mercury?
</I>
very much so, TLS is the only thing holding me back from publishing
content on Gemini. Mercury is something I was hoping more people would
pick up interest in.

&gt;<i> * are there clients and servers targeting both Gemini and Mercury?
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. the Gemini concept with and without TLS)
</I>
I haven't seen any but would love that idea!


Cheers,
Will
