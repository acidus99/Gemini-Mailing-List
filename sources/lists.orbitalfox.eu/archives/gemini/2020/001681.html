I think this is a great idea! It would go quite a long way to supporting 
collaborative editing. And as you say it is infrastructure we already have.

if your lines are about 25 characters long, 2kb is about 80 lines worth 
of text. That seems a nice sweet spot to me.

We could argue if you need more than that you will be better placed to 
find a more flexible upload option.

The only other part to the jigsaw in my view is a way to integrate the 
editing experience into the client so you can *round-trip* the content. 
As we know the first edit is seldom a perfect one.

The basic wiki concept has the following:

1. Page displays content (we can do that)
2. Edit mode of the existing page content
3. Upload (2k allowed - OK)
4. Review submitted content (return to 1)

For step 2, we want the user to be able to edit the existing content, 
not necessarily compose completely afresh.

One suggestion is that clients MAY present an integrated editor bound to 
a preformatted region on a page (perhaps the first one or a user 
selected one). This allows the re-editing of the existing content. This 
is then what is submitted when writing back via the submission.

This would cover the full lifecycle of simple yet basic wiki editing.
