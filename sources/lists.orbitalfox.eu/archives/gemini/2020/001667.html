I think an upload protocol should *not* be developed. We should instead 
concentrate on creating the *content* that should be uploaded, and 
improving the *existing* tools for getting content onto servers.

Until I started using Gemini, I had avoided learning how to use TRAMP in 
Emacs - it is a system which allows you to edit remote files, so you open 
up /ssh:gemini.ucant.org:public_gemini/index.gemini in the editor, and it 
does SFTP to gemini.ucant.org and edits public_gemini/index.gemini for you 
transparently. It knows about ftp and a bunch of other protocols. 
Similarly, there are all sorts of user-space filesystems out there 
nowadays, such as sshfs, and good old git post-receive hooks and NFS 
automounts. The situation on Windows is apparently even better.
So my conventional &quot;rsync this directory to the right spot on the server&quot; 
script is basically redundant.

I'd say, Keep Gemini Simple, and improve the documentation and tooling for 
*existing* systems of &quot;how do I update this file on the server&quot;. I'd also 
caution that WebDAV never took off, and this looks like GeminiDAV. And 
finally I'd caution that making things easier for the those who are not 
&quot;technically savvy&quot; should almost never be at the cost of indirectly
making it harder for those who are.
