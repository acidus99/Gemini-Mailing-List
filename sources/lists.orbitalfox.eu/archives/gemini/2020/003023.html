I recently started work on my own Gemini server (still a work in progress), and I needed a certificate to test my server. So I fired up ye olde DuckDuckGo and searched &quot;create self signed certificate openssl&quot; and found:

&gt;<i> It's important to put DNS name in the SAN and not the CN, because both the IETF and the CA/Browser Forums specify the practice. They also specify that DNS names in the CN are deprecated (but not prohibited). If you put a DNS name in the CN, then it must be included in the SAN under the CA/B policies. So you can't avoid using the Subject Alternate Name.
</I>
Now, of course, this doesn't have to apply to Gemini, but I wanted something that was as future-proof as I could make it, so I found a command to put names in the SAN without creating a config file, which got me:

&gt;<i> openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes \
</I>&gt;<i>  -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.crt -subj &quot;/CN=7f000001.nip.io&quot; \
</I>&gt;<i>  -addext &quot;subjectAltName=DNS:7f000001.nip.io&quot;
</I>
(I was testing localhost, so I used 7f000001.nip.io, which points to 127.0.0.1. RSA is fine enough security as is.)

This actually isn't that hard to do; I'm not sure what the equivalent would be in other SSL libraries, but at least in OpenSSL it's pretty simple. We don't necessarily have to say &quot;don't use the CN&quot;, but people should configure their certificates so that clients don't have to mess around with stdlib code just to accept them.

Just my two cents,
