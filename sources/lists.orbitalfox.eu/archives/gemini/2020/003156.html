I am currently working on a client for Android, and I am planning to make heavy use of caching, although I do not think a change in the protocol is necessary. In my usecase, I have a dataplan that's free, but just gives me flaky 32kbit/s at best, usually far less. (It's called &quot;messaging option&quot;). Loading a page on Gemini usually takes multiple seconds. This would be similar for packet radio and similar applications. Without caching, this is a huge PITA. I will take care to have a &quot;Reload&quot; button once I use caching, so the users themselves can decide when new content should be fetched.

I should add that in cases where there's an actual need for caching like
this, caching is totally fine by me, but I hope you can find a way to
add some kind of indicator to make it clear to the user whether you're
showing fresh or cached content!
