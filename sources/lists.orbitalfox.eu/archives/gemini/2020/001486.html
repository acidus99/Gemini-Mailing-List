<PRE>Hey all,

Just throwing out a quick idea I had last night while trying to sleep,
to see how people feel about it.  It's simple and easily ignorable and I
think it's kind of neat.

It's been a small pain point for some people for a while now that there
is no way for a Gemini client to know how large a file it's downloading
is without simply downloading the whole thing.  This is inconvenient
from a UI perspective, as there is no way to display a progress bar, and
simple clients like AV-98 which simply download a complete file and then
pass it off to a handler program appear to &quot;freeze&quot; on large downloads
with no clear indication that anything is happening.  This is a much
bigger problem for people on limited machines (e.g. low memory diskless
systems are perfectly viable for reading text/gemini content and
displaying small images but not for downloading large binaries, but they
can't gracefully opt out of the big stuff and are forced to simply
terminate the connection once a threshold amount of content has been
downloaded, and then wastefully discard that partial content) or
internet connections (e.g. people at sea using satellite data plans
which are billed per megabyte).

People usually want to address this by having the server somehow declare
the file size upfront in the header, as per HTTP's &quot;Content-Length&quot;, but
I've resisted that tooth and nail because there's no sensible way to do
it which doesn't turn the response header into an infinitely extensible
thing which people can tack their own variables onto, leaving us no
better off than HTTP (so, please, no more ideas on this front)...

I was very happy to realise that a lot of these problems can be solved,
or at least ameliorated, in a very simple way with an additional 2x
status code.  Since I plan to deprecate the current 21 code for ending a
transient certificate session, we could reuse 21 to mean &quot;SUCCESS, a
response body follows, and it's larger than $THRESHOLD MiB&quot; (note I am
proposing no change to the existing code 20 - 20 does NOT mean &quot;what's
coming in less than $THRESHOLD&quot;).  Simple clients could simply treat 21
as 20 and be in exactly the situation they are in now, so the graceful
degredation of status codes to their x0 form works nicely here.  But
e.g. AV-98 could print &quot;Downloading large file, please wait...&quot; upon
receving a 21, and then proceed as usual.  This is a very low effort
client change, but it solves the problem of people thinking something
has gone wrong when they unknowingly start a large download.  More
importantly, users in resource-limited environments could use clients
which simply terminate the connection immediately on seeing a header
starting with 21, providing a quick and low-waste &quot;opt out&quot; of large
content.

On the server side, again, a dirt simple server could just always serve
up 20 without actually breaking anything.  I realise that knowing
whether to use 20 or 21 for dynamically generated content may not be
straightforward - no problem, it is *always* valid to just send 20 when
in doubt.  21 is nothing more than a helpful hint to clients who might
need it.  It doesn't need to be 100% reliable to still have value.

This feels like a good idea to me.  It's totally optional and very easy
to handle on both the client and server sides, and I feel like being
friendly to small/slow computers and slow/intermittent network
connections is a good fit with the overall &quot;vibe&quot; of Gemini, provided
doing so does not conflict with overall simplicity.

Naturally, deciding to do this will lead immediately to a weeks-long
heated debate on what the appropriate value of $THRESHOLD should be.  We
*could* wade into those waters, but I'll just also throw out that we
could use 21, 22 and 23 to indicate payloads exceeding 1MiB, 10MiB or
100MiB respectively and leave it at that.  Clients targetting
resource-limited environments could let their users configure their own
threshold for early termination of downloads.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
