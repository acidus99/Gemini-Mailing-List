<PRE>A solution to this problem for those who think this is an issue:

Just write a server that pulls single linebreaks back into one
line in source files before sending them to clients. Then you can
use vim more effectively or whatever without imposing change on a
spec already followed by oodles of clients and servers and
thousands upon thousands of pages of content.

Our options back when softwrap was decided were:

1) hardwrapping at some crazy small number of characters that
would only look good on a phone
2) optionally doing error-prone text reflowing that so it might
look good on something other than a phone
3) what actually happened

Each of these is still less complex than this markdown suggestion
and was done at a time when there was basically no content on the
protocol and even still didn't require anything to be rewritten,
because hard-wrapped content is still viewablw with softwrap.

What is being suggested would require substantial rewrites for 
literally every single thing ever created related to gemini, and
even if we accepted that, would require some means for new
clients to know the difference between the new spec and the old
one, either giving us a new mime type or some kind of version
header, and now we're in solderpunk's nightmare scenario.

So no, I don't think this will happen, but you could always write
a server that autoconverts your markdown-y content into gemtext!

best,
lel
