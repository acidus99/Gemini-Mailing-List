If you are adding a good portion of CommonMark to the specification,
then why not make take a sub-set of CommonMark?

For example:
* restrict the usage of nested lists;
* restrict in-line links and say that &quot;all links should follow the
syntax `=&gt; link description`&quot;;  (or even better `=&gt;
[description](link)`)
* restrict horizontal breaks to only `---`;
* etc;

Then no-one needs to re-implement yet another markup language, and can
just re-use their favourite CommonMark parser and feed it this
sub-set.

Granted this would open the door for people to just ignore the spec
and use full CommonMark syntax, but then one could implement &quot;linters&quot;
on the server side (or even in the client side) to check that only the
Gemini sub-set syntax is used.




&gt;<i> Further, after making that change I plan to decree &quot;absolutely no spec

</I>&gt;<i> seriously *discuss* possible spec changes for that long.
</I>

Why not add a version like `text/x-gemini-2020-03`?


Moreover section 6 of RFC 2046 (governing the MIME types) states:

    <A HREF="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046#section-6">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046#section-6</A>

~~~~
A media type value beginning with the characters &quot;X-&quot; is a private
value, to be used by consenting systems by mutual agreement.  Any

&quot;X-&quot; prefix, and publicly specified values shall never begin with
&quot;X-&quot;.
