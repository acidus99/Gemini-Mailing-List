Indeed it is ugly, one other workaround to this is having

&gt;<i>	```
</I>&gt;<i>	```
</I>
interpreted as literal '```' to avoid altering preformatted text, and
to be clear, this does not apply to the case of having multiple
preformatted text blocks next to each other, this only applies to a
single preformatted text block that contains nothing.

&gt;<i> And that is if escaping only considers syntax that would be

</I>&gt;<i> meaning a line starting with &quot;\#&quot; is still translated to &quot;#&quot; inside
</I>&gt;<i> preformatted text, it could actually make the problem worse by
</I>&gt;<i> increasing the number of preformatted lines that must be modified.
</I>
I suggested a special parser rule for preformatted text blocks that is
separate for the rule used for all other text, and this rule only
applies to '^\```', though I agree with your concerns.

&gt;<i> &gt; also keep in mind that '\' does not only escape the character after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it, it disables line formatting, because in the example above, if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; '=' is escaped, '&gt;' is right after it and can be interpreted as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quote.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see how this is correct? A quote line must start with &gt;, not
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt;. If in &quot;\=&gt;&quot;, the \ escapes the = so that the resulting text is =&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see how it could be interpreted as a quote.
</I>
I'm pointing out to those writing parsers to avoid the pitfall of just
skipping the character after that escape character and continuing as
normal from there, I do that myself so I thought it might be worth
noting, to clarify, if the parser ignores the character that is escaped
and continues as normal from there, then:

&gt;<i>	\=&gt;
</I>
escaped only the '=' which means now that '&gt;' is the first character in
the line and can be interpreted as a quote block, of course, this is
implementation specific, and I don't know how others have implemented
their parsers.
