I'm not trying to twist information. I feel like your argument hinges on him having been able to
also successfully argue the fair use angle.

</I>
So an archive counts as fair use then. A non commercial archive can use Field as precedent: it's
for archival purposes, the work is available for free online, it may be a complete archive but the
full work is available for free online, and there's no market for someone's random prose that they
make available for free.

Ergo, anyone can make an archive of anything they aren't explicitly told not to via robots.txt (at
least in the US) and get away with it.

&gt;<i> Anyways, you're the one who brought up this court case, not me. I don't agree with

Okay, but &quot;gemini users and what they think&quot; won't matter. The only place to seek relief is a court
of law, and the court of law is firmly against you here.

While I was drafting this you responded to my other email, so I'll merge the two replies here:

Well, if the case never made it to the Supreme Court, then the lower court's ruling stands. Ergo, it's still a precedent and most courts in the US would still follow it.

Just my two cents,
