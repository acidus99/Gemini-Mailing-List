Yeah, but *everything*'s quite useful for some people, and individually
each little useful thing is not *that* much more complicated, and then
one day...

Which is not to say nothing like this will ever happen, I actually think
that really good multilingual support is a lot more important than many
other things and might be worth the cost.  But I've definitely changed
my mind that this is a quick and easy thing which can be snuck in along
with defining lining breaks and SNI and stuff.  We can take our time to
figure out a good solution to this.

Cheers,
