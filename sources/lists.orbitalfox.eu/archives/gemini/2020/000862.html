well, if it's ONLY CRLF, then it enables making basic clients in *ANY* language, including pure assembly, if someone were brave enough (well, the core part, you'd probably write the TLS part in C or something, still)

maybe change the spec slightly, so, after the header, there's CRLF, immediately after which is an empty line with the line ending that applies for the rest of the document, and require at least one non-empty line after that?
that wouldn't matter for more advanced languages, which can just ignore that and use builtin functions, but for more basic ones, it makes it easy to read, &quot;is it LF, else is it CR followed by LF, else assume CR&quot;... while it would be possible to do that with normal content lines too, it'd be harder, as you can't just &quot;eat&quot; a byte or two from the start...
