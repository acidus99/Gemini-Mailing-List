Again, clients are free to ignore the &quot;do not cache&quot; response code as they wish. It would be considered bad form, and it may confuse the everloving hell out of somebody who's requesting a random picture and keeps getting the same one, but you're free to do it, just as you're free to cache any response now.

Just my two cents,
Robert &quot;khuxkm&quot; Miles

(PS: still working on that implementation)
