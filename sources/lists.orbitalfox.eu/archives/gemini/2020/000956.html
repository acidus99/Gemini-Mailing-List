I'd rather make life a little harder for developers - who are
technical people who know what a CR and LF are and are, anyway, signing
up for a bit of fiddly detail by undertaking to implement an internet
protocol from scratch - than make life harder for content authors, who
may have no idea what this nonsense is all about and are arguably doing
an even bigger service for the community by providing something to use
our present abundance of servers and clients to read.

Sorry if this seems blunt!
