I have a script which checks for redirects on websites and reports
status codes. On web it is much smaller problem - the saved latency is
much less. This way I can see dead links and links which could cause
problems - http redirects instead of https or normal redirects which can be
optimised. Maybe something similar could be done for gemini, so that content
authors could check if their links are ok.

I don't like this idea, because content authors should focus on writing
content, not on how the content looks or if they are writing it the
&quot;correct way&quot;. Linters for gemini code sound like a bad idea and a sign
that something is wrong.

&gt;<i> On the server side, server authors should take care when doing things
</I>&gt;<i> like automatically generating directory listings to put trailing slashes
</I>&gt;<i> in links to directories so that the redirect is not necessary.
</I>That's the best solution I think.
