How can the client tell if it's percent encoded or not? If you start

Exactly.  To make things worse, space is a protocol element in link lines
and *can't* be left unencoded by the author, whichever way we choose.


&gt;<i> We can decide to *always* percent encode links in gemtext (as the spec
</I>&gt;<i> states now) or to *never* do it, but I don't see how we can reasonably
</I>&gt;<i> have both.
</I>

I agree.  But what we can have (and it's messy, but not as messy as the
alternatives) is &quot;authors encode percent and space&quot; and &quot;clients encode all
other reserved and non-ASCII characters.&quot;

&gt;<i> Consider another hypothetical case:
</I>
=&gt; teddybearoftheyear.com/vote?ew0k%20The%20Great Vote for me!
&gt;<i>
</I>
That's the best you can do.  But in the case where the link line is

&gt;<i> =&gt; teddybearoftheyear.com/vote?&#1048;&#1074;&#1072;&#1085;%20&#1043;&#1088;&#1086;&#1079;&#1085;&#1099;&#1081;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://teddybearoftheyear.com/vote?ew0k%20The%20Great">http://teddybearoftheyear.com/vote?ew0k%20The%20Great</A>&gt; &#1043;&#1086;&#1083;&#1086;&#1089;&#1091;&#1081; &#1079;&#1072; &#1084;&#1077;&#1085;&#1103;! [1]
</I>&gt;<i> [2] [3]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>then the client must translate it for sending over the wire into

<A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A>
teddybearoftheyear.com/vote?%D0%98%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%20%D0%93%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9
&lt;<A HREF="http://teddybearoftheyear.com/vote?ew0k%20The%20Great">http://teddybearoftheyear.com/vote?ew0k%20The%20Great</A>&gt;

because making the author type all that is wholly abominable.  Online
URL-encoders are not that helpful, because they give you + instead of %20.

[1] This is Ivan the Terrible, who for most of his life was actually a
quite effective tsar despite his (occupational) paranoia and a serious
outbreak of madness just before he died; a better translation would be
&quot;Ivan the Formidable&quot;.  Still, nobody would call him a teddy bear (and so
his ukase &quot;Vote for me!&quot; would probably be in vain).

[2] The latest spec change makes this line incorrect unless &quot;
teddybearoftheyear.com/vote&quot; is to be interpreted as a relative path.  It
needs to be prefixed by &quot;<A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A>&quot; or at the very least &quot;//&quot;.

[3] If the space had not been %-encoded by the author, the Tsar's second
name would be part of the link name and not part of the IRI.
