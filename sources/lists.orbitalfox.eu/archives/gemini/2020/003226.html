The point of that paragraph was that my proposal makes it so that you
only have to modify the preformatting toggle lines to paste in
arbitrary content, not the content itself. It does achieve that.
(CDATA does not because the string &quot;]]&gt;&quot; ends it and there is no rule
about matching the number about brackets used to open it, so a CDATA
section cannot include &quot;]]&gt;&quot;.)

For what it's worth, the reason I don't think HTML needs this as much
as gemtext is because HTML already has a general escaping mechanism,
and is not necessarily meant to be written by hand anyway.

Interesting. Clarification: is this like PostgreSQL string escapes,
where two consecutive toggle lines inside a block come out as a
literal &quot;```&quot;? Or does it only apply to empty blocks (and not the same
pattern within a block with other content), so that embedding a
literal &quot;```&quot; requires four in a row (one to end the current block,
then two for the literal sequence, then the fourth to open another
preformatting block - assuming two adjacent blocks will be merged)?
