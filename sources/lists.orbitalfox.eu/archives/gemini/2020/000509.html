This is nicely timed, actually, as things like robots.txt are now
looming larger on my personal radar than they have previously - with
CAPCOM I am writing for the first time a program which automatically
makes Gemini requests, and I'm very keen on making sure that it's a
&quot;good citizen&quot;.  There hasn't been too much overt discussion of good
Gemini citizenship yet, but now that non-human clients are becoming more
common, there should be.  Robots.txt is obviously part of that package.

(It's *not* super relevant to feed aggregation, because nobody publishes
a feed without the expectation that it is read entirely by bots, but
other issues, especially rate limiting, rate)

It's been many years since I read any robots.txt specs from the web.  I
will refresh my memory and start thinking about this, and asking
questions, in the hopes that we can finalise some stuff soon.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
