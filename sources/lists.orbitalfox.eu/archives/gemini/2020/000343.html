<PRE>Hmm, I've just realised something which might salvage this whole mess.
It's possible even that what I'm about to describe is exactly what the
&quot;long line&quot; folks have been talking about all along without my
realising it.  Sorry for missing it if so, but I don't think it was
ever made explicit!

I have always conceptualised our choice as being between two
alternatives:

1. Hard-wrapped text which clients display verbatim, line-by-line,
   exactly the way Gopher works.

2. What I'll call &quot;full blown reflowing&quot;, the way HTML and LaTeX work.
   This involves lines longer than the viewport being split up into
   multiple shorter lines, but also consecutive non-blank lines
   shorter than the viewport being joined into fewer, longer lines.
   Basically, this model of reflow is &quot;paragraph based&quot;.  Consecutive
   non-empty lines of text form clumps called paragraphs which are
   formatted as a whole, whether this results in more or fewer total
   lines compared to the &quot;source&quot;.

There is another option that I hadn't thought about until now, which
is to do only the first half of 2. above.  That is, lines longer than
the viewport get broken up nicely at word boundaries into lines of
length equal to or less than the viewport width - but that's it.
Consecutive shorter lines are *not* joined together.  Blank lines in
the &quot;source&quot; are rendered, one by one, into empty vertical space.
The renderer has no explicit concept of a paragraph.

This allows writing things we want to look like paragraphs as
individual long lines (easy for most editors, plays nicely with
version control) with the knowledge they'll be nicely wrapped to the
viewport width, but it doesn't break things like
one
word
per
line
for
emphasis, because the lines won't be sucked up and joined together, and
it also doesn't break lists for the same reason (more on lists below).

I kind of like this.  Unlike the paragraph-oriented web/LaTeX model
where ten consecutive newlines and two consecutive newlines are
identical, this also allows us to put larger gaps between paragraphs
to give the impression of pausing for thought.





Neat, huh?

This does rescue lists, right?  A list of short items:

* Mercury
* Gemini
* Apollo
* Shuttle

does't get turned into a mess of:

* Mercury * Gemini * Apollo Shuttle

But multi-line list items get wrapped appropriately.  Dumb clients
which don't recognise list items at all can do this in an ugly way, by
applying exactly the same wrapping code they use for normal lines:

* This is a multi-line list item where the beginning of lines after
the first one are not offset from the left hand of the viewport to
match the offset of the first one.

Whereas smarter clients can recognise lines beginning with &quot;*&quot; as
being list items and do slightly nicer formatting:

* This is a multi-line list item which has been handled by a smarter
  client which results in a nicer appearance - a strictly optional bit
  of extra work for ambitious client authors.

There doesn't seem to be any need to keep track of whether or not you
are inside of a list or not?

This syntax is strictly line-based, and recognising a special type of
line involves only looking at the first few characters.  Recognising
Gemini links is of course mandatory, but so long as every other
special kind of line can be handled appropriately by just printing it
(in the way that list items seemingly can be) then defining special
line types for headings, etc. doesn't actually add any extra burden on
simple clients.  It's basically a question of how many cases you want
to handle in a switch statement...

This seems pretty great, the only downside is that even bare minimal
clients need to be able to wrap long lines to result in readability.
I'm not quite as bothered by this as I was before I realised that
Python has a standard library function which just does this (it's
even pretty smart, e.g. if the final word of a line would make that
line longer than the requested width, and the word has a hyphen in
it, it'll break at the hyphen if that shortens the lin enough), but
it's still not great.  I wonder how common that kind of function is
across standard libraries?

Surely it can't be this simple.  I look forward to somebody pointing
out the inevitable overlooked fatal flaw...

Cheers,
Solderpunk
