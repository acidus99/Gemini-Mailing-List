<PRE>* Tuesday, 2020-06-02 at 19:26 +0000 - solderpunk &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini">solderpunk at SDF.ORG</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i>But if anybody thinks they see a real problem with the design of 
</I>&gt;<i>anything currently in the protocol, in principle now is the time to 
</I>&gt;<i>mention it.
</I>
One little thing that's bothered me ever since first reading the spec, 
and which I can't see being discussed before (sorry if I missed it):
there seems to be no way to quote a line starting with &quot;```&quot;. So for 
example there's no way to present in a preformatted text block a gemini 
document which contains &quot;```&quot; lines.

Relatedly, there's no way to have a text line which starts with any of 
the magic character sequences.

Here's one possible way to solve both these problems *and* the problem 
of invisible strings on a &quot;```&quot; line being used for extensibility:

A line consisting of just the three characters &quot;```&quot; is a preformatting 
toggle line. A line of the form &quot;```TEXT&quot; is interpreted as a text line 
with contents TEXT if preformatted mode is currently off, and as 
a preformatted line with contents TEXT if preformatted mode is on.


Examples:

``````

```#this# is heavy type, not a header

```
``````     ```     ```     ```
  ```     ```     ```     ```
   ```     ```     ```     ```
    raindrops keep falling on my text
```


That last one would be equivalent to:

```
``````     ```     ```     ```
``` ```     ```     ```     ```
```  ```     ```     ```     ```
```   raindrops keep falling on my text
```

which is easier to read.
