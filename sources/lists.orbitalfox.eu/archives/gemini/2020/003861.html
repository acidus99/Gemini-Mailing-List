The response has a textual part at time, which is UTF-8 encoded. Assuming a 2x response code,  the content itself is defined by its content-type, which can be anything, in any encoding, following any relevant  convention. UTF-8 (aka Universal Coded Character Set Transformation Format &#8211; 8-bit) itself is an encoding of Unicode. There is no such things as plain text in 2020.

But this is about URLs, no? 

As long as gemini follows established standards, then one must deal with encodings as defined by those standards.

Not sure why this is controversial. The tooling exists. No one writes UTF-8 by hand. Ditto for URLs encoding/decoding.

Use the Tools, Luke.

P.S.
There is perhaps a bit of a sleight of hands running through gemini's rhetoric about how &quot;simple&quot; everything is. But nothing is *that* simple once one looks at the details. The rabbit hole runs deep. Rome was not build in one day. Nor are gemini's foundations. 

P.P.S.
For entertainment purpose, the DNS RFC dependency graph [pdf]:
