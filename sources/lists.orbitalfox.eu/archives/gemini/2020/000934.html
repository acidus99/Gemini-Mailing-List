Ye, I wanted to be able to show where the 'match' comes from, so people
can judge in a more informed way if it's relevant.

&gt;<i> A couple of minor thoughts for your consideration

Sure, makes sense

&gt;<i> 2. Might be better UI to display snippets as bullets. That way clients that

</I>
I'll have to read the gemini spec again :P

&gt;<i> 3. Is there a way for the user to lengthen the snippets, perhaps there could
</I>&gt;<i> be some alternative URLs that allow longer or shorter results shown.
</I>
That should be easily done, in principle I could also allow the
modification of the number of highlights returned (currently max 5).

&gt;<i> 4. Maybe there needs to be some pagination of the results if too many are
</I>&gt;<i> shown, or maybe that is not a problem yet...
</I>
Currently not a problem, and when it becomes a problem I think I prefer
to just cap the result set. Using other (http) search engines showed me
that everything not on page 1 is probably not relevant anyway and if I
would offer [1] people could refine the search to be more relevant.

&gt;<i> otherwise - keep up the good work!
</I>
Thanks for the comments, they're very useful!
