Oh, there was also the argument made at some point that if Gemini
doesn't have any standardised syntax for these common formatting tasks,
ambitious clients might start trying to recognise the most popular
non-standard ways of doing it, which could easily lead to divergent
implementations across clients.  So, better to provide a standard way to
do to provide us control and uniformity.

I don't mean to claim either of these arguments are bulletproof, I just
think that a principle of &quot;we shouldn't do anything that risks
fragmentation of Geminispace&quot; (which is obviously a good principle)
necessarily comes down clearly on one side of this question or the
other.

Cheers,
