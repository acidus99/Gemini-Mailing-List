</I>
I don't really think this is a scenario where there are things that weren't &quot;intended&quot;; what was intended was to create a protocol, lighter than the Web and heavier than Gopher, for serving content securely (at least, from where I sit and what I see). Obviously, the protocol isn't perfect, so sometimes it needs things added that may not have been there at the beginning, but fit the intent of the protocol.

&gt;<i> It would be discouraging for people to have their implementations break
</I>&gt;<i> so often because the protocol is never stable and features get
</I>&gt;<i> added/removed with stuff changing all the time.
</I>
The spec was created around August of 2019 (at least, the list was first posted to in mid-August). It's only a year old. If a breaking change *needs* to be made, it's not too late yet.

&gt;<i> The way I see it, Gemini is complete, the only way going forward is
</I>&gt;<i> tidying up the spec and growing the gemspace with more content, and in
</I>&gt;<i> the meantime, Gemini implementations will mature and become more
</I>&gt;<i> appealing for newcomers.
</I>
I'm willing to agree with you on this point; it seems like we don't *need* this breaking change, at least not yet.

&gt;&gt;<i> Well, if all I want is gemini + X, then using protocol Y with its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bloat of features I *don't* need is less tempting than sending a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feature proposal to the gemini ML. And again, that's a good thing! It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> means people are engaging and shaping the trajectory of their own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> internet future. A rejected proposal is a hundred times better than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one that was never discussed for fear of ridicule or social
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> repercussions. The community is alive and vibrant :D
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You wouldn't want to add revision control to Gemini, that's what Git is
</I>&gt;<i> for, just like you wouldn't add remote shell to Gemini because that's
</I>&gt;<i> what SSH is for, this should apply to everything, use the right tool
</I>&gt;<i> for the right task.
</I>
That's not really a good comparison. Obviously you wouldn't add revision control and/or a remote shell to Gemini; that has nothing to do with serving content. But if the X in &quot;gemini + X&quot; has to do with content (serving it, etc.), it's worth considering.

Just my two cents,
Robert &quot;khuxkm&quot; Miles
