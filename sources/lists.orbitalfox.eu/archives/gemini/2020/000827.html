<PRE>Ahoy!

The three month spec freeze announced, well, almost three months ago,
will be expiring soon.  Things to ponder/discuss have been piling
up.  So, I've been considering dealing with some of the &quot;low hanging
fruit&quot; early (I have some time off work later this week because of a
national holiday).  I'm thinking in particular of fairly minor
changes, where it is obvious that there is a problem in what's already
specced or important functionality is missing, and where there are
fairly obviously solutions.

To this end, I'm going to outline some proposals below for feedback.
I *hope* that these will be pretty uncontroversial.  Feedback is
welcome, as always, but we have to do *something* about these issues,
so if you really think what I propose below is a bad idea, a better
alternative would be a very good thing to bring to the discussion!

Here we go, then...

ISSUE 1:

Problem: The current spec does not impose any limit on request header
length.  The status code and META field can be separated by
arbitrarily many spaces and/or tabs.  Malicious or buggy servers can
hang or crash carelessly written clients by sending an infinite stream
of whitespace.  It's not clear *why* anybody would want to do this (a
&quot;reverse DOS attack&quot; is not very useful!), but it's clearly a problem
nevertheless.

Proposal: Redfine response headers from:

&lt;STATUS&gt;&lt;whitespace&gt;&lt;META&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;

to:

&lt;STATUS&gt; &lt;META&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;

i.e. exactly one space character between &lt;STATUS&gt; and &lt;META&gt;

Rationale: Allowing multiple whitespace characters of different kinds
makes sense in, e.g., the link syntax of text/gemini - that has to be
written and read by human content authors, so it's a good idea to
accommodate different editor behaviours and different personal
preferences for laying things out.  But response headers are written
and read by software, so there's no need to be so generous.
Specifying the header format more precisely actually just makes life
slightly easier for client authors.  As a result of this, the maximum
length of a response becomes finite (as the length of &lt;STATUS&gt; and
&lt;META&gt; are already well defined elsewhere).

Client authors who want to follow Postel's law won't need to make any
changes here.  I imagine many server authors also won't actually need
to.  The most probable scenario is no change needed (the server already
sends one space) or a single s/\t/ / is neeed.

ISSUE 2:

Problem: The spec makes a big fuss about how text/gemini is
line-oriented, but does not clearly state what exactly constitutes a
line.  The definition of link lines includes a &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; at the end but
it's not clear if that applies to all line types - or whether I even
meant to do this or it was a careless error.

Proposal: Actually, it turns out this is decided for us.  RFC2046,
which defines the text/* MIME media type and the text/plain subtype
covers this very clearly:

---
4.1.1.  Representation of Line Breaks

   The canonical form of any MIME &quot;text&quot; subtype MUST always represent a
   line break as a CRLF sequence.  Similarly, any occurrence of CRLF in
   MIME &quot;text&quot; MUST represent a line break.  Use of CR and LF outside of
   line break sequences is also forbidden.

   This rule applies regardless of format or character set or sets
   involved.
---

Since text/gemini is, well, text/gemini, it is a &quot;text&quot; subtype and
using anything other than CRLF means we're violating the RFCs we're
supposedly building on top of.

So, CRLF everywhere it is.

I propose it be mostly the server's job to handle this.  Text editors
on different operating systems used by content authors will use
various different line break encodings which are beyond our control,
so we can't really make it the author's job.  Servers can translate LF
to CRLF before sending content over the network.  This way clients
only need to handle the &quot;canonical&quot; format, no matter what authors do.

Rationale: Don't break foundational RFCs.

Yeah, I know, this is tedious and no fun for server authors, but, well,
see above.

ISSUE 3:

Problem: There's no way to specify the (human) language a text/gemini document
is written in.

Proposal: Define a new parameter for the text/gemini MIME type
(alongside the previously defined `charset`) to specify language.
Following the example set by HTML, it seems natural to call the
parameter `lang` and to allow values as per RFC1766, e.g.:

text/gemini; charset=utf-8; lang=en
text/gemini; charset=utf-8; lang=en-US
text/gemini; charset=utf-8; lang=en-GB
text/gemini; charset=utf-8; lang=es
text/gemini; charset=utf-8; lang=fr

Rationale: A protocol for a global network which targets human beings
reading textual content as its first-class application shouldn't be
Anglocentric!  Gemini already has:

* A Spanish-only server at <A HREF="gemini://gagarin.p4g.club">gemini://gagarin.p4g.club</A>
* An auditory browser which is/will be language aware
* A search engine which will eventually become more difficult to use
  without the ability to limit searches to target languages.

This looks a bit scary at first from an extensibility point of view,
because it does kind of open the door to defining all sorts of
additional parameters.  However, the pre-exisiting MIME RFCs we're
leveraging here make it pretty clear that (i) these things aren't
open-ended, each MIME type and subtype has a fixed and finite set of
defined parameters, and (ii) that only certain kinds of semantic
information are really appropriate here.  So this is about as safe as
extensibility gets.

ISSUE 4:

Problem: Name-based virtual hosting is explicitly described as being
supported in the spec, but no mention is made of SNI (Server Name
Indication, a TLS extension which puts the desired server hostname in
the TLS handshake).  Without this, virtual hosting can't be made to
work reliably.

Proposal: Mandate use of SNI by clients.

Rationale: Earlier I proposed speccing that clients SHOULD use SNI but
requiring that servers be robust against its absence, by assigning a
default hostname.  Upon more thought, this won't work.  I was thinking
about how a missing Host: header was handled in this situation in
HTTP, where a default host works just fine.  But with TLS involved,
this is a problem: if the default host is not the one the client has
actually requested, the default certificate's Common Name and Subject
Alternative Names won't match what the client expects and the
certificiate will be rejected.  So, I think we just have to require
SNI.

If you're a client developer, please check whether or not the TLS
library you are using supports SNI!  If not, let me know.  I imagine
in this day and age they all will, so this won't be a burdensome
requirement.

That's it!

Cheers,
Solderpunk
