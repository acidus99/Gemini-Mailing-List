</I>&gt;<i> Last summer I had been doing a lot of thinking and a lot of writing in
</I>&gt;<i> my phlog on the subject of improvements which could be made to gopher,
</I>&gt;<i> as part of a wider conversation which was going on in the phlogosphere
</I>&gt;<i> at the time.  I wanted to keep following that train of thought, but I
</I>&gt;<i> knew that not everybody in the Gopher community was interested, and I
</I>&gt;<i> also didn't want the subject to steal too much focus away from the other
</I>&gt;<i> things I had been happily phlogging about for years.  So I decided to
</I>&gt;<i> start an entirely new section of my gopherhole, and announced in my
</I>&gt;<i> phlog that I would be sticking all future posts on the matter of new
</I>&gt;<i> protocol design there, in a separate space for those who wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> follow it.  In the same announcement, I gave the thing a name for the
</I>&gt;<i> first time: Project Gemini!  I made that announcement on June 20th,
</I>&gt;<i> 2019.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the time, I honestly didn't consider the project anything more
</I>&gt;<i> than a thought experiment.  I was genuinely shocked when I heard just
</I>&gt;<i> two days later on June 22nd that Sean Conner had gone and actually
</I>&gt;<i> *implemented* the damn thing and setup a publically accessible Gemini
</I>&gt;<i> server at gemini.conman.org.  I'm no less surprised to be writing this
</I>&gt;<i> message one year later in the knowledge that Geminispace is just shy of
</I>&gt;<i> *one hundred* public servers!  The enthusiasm that Gemini has attracted
</I>&gt;<i> and the growth that the community and the space have undergone in the
</I>&gt;<i> past year has exceeded my every expectation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to say &quot;thank you&quot; to everybody who has contributed to
</I>&gt;<i> Gemini in a small way or a big way in this time.  Thanks to everybody
</I>&gt;<i> who has helped shape the protocol through discussion on the mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> (and thanks to the generous host of this this mailing list!); to
</I>&gt;<i> everybody who has written a server, or a client, or any other software;
</I>&gt;<i> to everybody who is running a Gemini server; to everybody who is
</I>&gt;<i> producing content for Geminispace; and to everybody who is helping to
</I>&gt;<i> spread awareness of the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We've come a long way in the past year, and I think we can rightly be
</I>&gt;<i> very proud of what we've built.  Now that the fundamentals of the
</I>&gt;<i> protocol have solidified, I am very excited to see what we can achieve
</I>&gt;<i> together as we start to shift focus toward building both static and
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic content in our new space: the Gemini journey has only just
</I>&gt;<i> begun.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Onward and upward!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Solderpunk
