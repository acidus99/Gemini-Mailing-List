This is a good question, let me show my opinion about why i agree with
these changes.

In short  to me, the reason  to put a space  after &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;=&gt;&quot;  is the
same that changed  &quot;*&quot; to &quot;*&lt;space&gt;&quot;.  If, in a  distant future, a new
convention appears for identify a word, or a text starting with a word
using  &quot;&gt;&quot;  (for   example)  the  gemini  parser  will   steps  in  an
inconvenience  like the  ones we  are discussing  in this  thread with
&quot;#&quot;. Because  is (in  my opinion)  unlikely that a  person (i  mean an
human being  :-)) writing a text  that will be read  by other persons,
marks  a word  using a  string prefix  that include  a word  separator
(including space)  after and  before or  in the middle  of it  i think
would be a good  idea change the format to require a  space for any of
the symbols Solderpunk mentioned.

This is, of course, probably not  the only reason to make this changes
(and maybe is not very valid :)) but i can not find any better at this
time! ;D

I hope i was able to explain my point even with my bad English!

Bye!
