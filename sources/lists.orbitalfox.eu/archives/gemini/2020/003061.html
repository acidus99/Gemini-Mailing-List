Thanks marc, and thanks John for the details. One more point to clarify:

Earlier this year SPDX updated its guidelines to permit the inclusion on the
list of _some_ source-available licenses that don't meet OSI / FSF requirements
for their respective definitions. The guidelines are at [1] if you are
interested.

Under the revised guidelines, a few licenses that have been called &quot;ethical
source&quot; licenses are on the list. For instance, the Hippocratic License 2.1
was added to the list earlier this year. [2] As John noted, the SPDX community
does not aim to establish its own definitions for terms like free or open 
source software, and tries to defer to other groups that are focused on those
topics.

I realize I've taken things far afield from Gemini, so I'll hold off from
further licensing trivia on this list  :)  Happy to chat offline if folks
have questions about any of this.

Steve
