_minimalism_:  as a personal taste and aesthetic principle, Yes. Also
a guiding principle, as frugality.

_simplicity_: Yes, by far the most important reason -- as in &quot;less
moving parts&quot;, &quot;no black box&quot;. Easily understanding all the core parts
to the ground  Grasping it all at the same time without digging deep.

It relates to &quot;_explainability_&quot;:  explain sockets and basic network
to a beginner and they will grasp Gemini without pain - it could even
be a basic example of how to use sockets

Back to the analogy: Show me a bicycle, I understand immediately how
it works - except maybe the freewheel :-)  Show me the modern SUV
engine fuel injection system. I somehow _know_ what it does. I know it
is very efficient. I know the black box contains powerful MCUs with
sophisticated algorithms. I don't really feel I understand it.

I remember a Python core developer coming up with a nice motto for a
Python conference many years ago: &quot;It fits my brain&quot;.  Gemini, without
TLS fits my brain.  A bicycle, even an old car may fit my brain. A
modern car does not anymore.

_easier DIYability_: Yes. closely related to simplicity. A _very
refreshing_ aspect of Gemini is &quot;it is so simple you can implement it
in a few hours. -- Ooops... and for TLS?  -- it is very simple. Just
call this [big] shared library. -- Hmm ... if I call a big TLS library
where it becomes complex, I could as well _very easily_ build a
HTTP/HTML client by calling libcurl, right?  And arguably, I can find
libcurl in as many platforms as libtls!

I think it relates also to hardware hobbyists. I don't mean the
Raspberry Pi sort of thing (actually more powerful than hardly old
PCs). I mean rather Arduino-like boards. I could imagine some smart
guys will or have already implemented a ultra minimal TCP stack, and
PPP to an internet gateway and could use Gemini -- ... probably not
with TLS.
