That sounds like a really nice feature that some people would value in a
client that offered it. If, while browsing gemini, I could quickly set
the colors or styling on a domain level it could be neat to visually
separate places I go routinely. Some users might value that feature
enough to choose a client that offers it. Others wouldn't care.

Another option on the client level would be to hash the domain into a
color code of some sort, dynamically creating variation in the
backgrounds to a reasonable degree (shades of grey? below a certain
lumen?). That would give the user an obvious indication if a link
followed changed domains. Again, it might be of value to somebody and
others won't care.

We're getting a plethora of clients popping up. Maybe some of these new
ones want a way to differentiate themselves. I'd suggest that putting
any and all of these levels of control into the client's hands would be
great for gemini long term. The problems come when we want to solve
these things server-side.
