...wait.  I didn't actually remove relative links at all.  That's a
relief.  I was tired when I saw Sean's email and assumed the first!

I just went through everything again.  My email to this list explaining
the changes I made didn't square up with the actual changes I made to
the spec.  Sorry for the confusion.  To be very clear, relative links
are absolutely still permitted in text/gemini documents, and in fact
even schemeless links are still permitted in text/gemini documents.  The
only actual change to the spec that pertains to =&gt; links is that I
removed the part saying that if there was no scheme the client should
assume one of <A HREF="gemini://.">gemini://.</A>  This, I think, is actually fine - see Alex
Schroeder's post on the nice use of these rare kind of link for serving
text/gemini over other protocols:
<A HREF="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/page/2020-11-30_Gemini_specification_changes_in_a_disagreeable_way">gemini://alexschroeder.ch/page/2020-11-30_Gemini_specification_changes_in_a_disagreeable_way</A>

Schemeless links are only forbidden in requests, i.e. what a client
sends to a server.

Sorry again for the confusion.  I hope this won't happen again, and I
hope it would also be obvious, but for the record, where a change to the
spec and my announcement to the spec don't match up, the actual spec
document is, of course, authoritative.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
