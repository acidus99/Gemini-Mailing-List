No, I don't like that idea.

&gt;<i> The same issue exists with text lines (it's impossible to display &quot;=&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> or &quot;#&quot; at the beginning of a line of text), but I'm not concerned
</I>&gt;<i> about that because having to prefix such lines with a space is not a
</I>&gt;<i> big deal for plain text, whereas it is for code.

I have suggested this in IRC as I've considered that someone might have
use for this, I agree with your argument, and since gemtext processing
happens only by reading the first few bytes of each line, it is
possible to introduce a new line format that is '\' which is escaped
line, where it discards line formatting that is based on the first few
characters so

&gt;<i>	\=&gt; this is escaped
</I>
will print

&gt;<i>	=&gt; this is escaped
</I>
also keep in mind that '\' does not only escape the character after it,
it disables line formatting, because in the example above, if '=' is
escaped, '&gt;' is right after it and can be interpreted as a quote.

Now, even pre-formatted text toggle characters can be escaped by adding
a rule in your parser to consider '\```' within a pre-formatted text
block and translate it to literal '```'.

Anyone else who might find my suggestion unappealing or have a better
idea, feel free to share, I think this is a flaw with the gemtext
document format not to have a way to escape certain characters to
disable them from being interpreted mistakenly, all other formats do
have a mechanism for doing this.
