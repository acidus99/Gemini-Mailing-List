<PRE>Hello,

I have a suggestion to add to the list and a question on parsing quote 
lines.

&gt;<i> I'm trying to prepare a list of spec issues that I want to finalise as
</I>&gt;<i> soon as possible.  If you think I've forgotten something, please let me know.
</I>
The current spec suggests supporting TOFU.  I think you may want to 
consider also supporting using the default/system certificate authority 
trust system as a fallback.  This allows certificates signed by Let's 
Encrypt or others to be used without the client having to store the 
known certificate. It also allows server operators to renew certificates 
without breaking clients.

This might be the behavior of clients today (trust system trusted CAs or 
use TOFU), but it's nice to have clearly defined behavior.

&gt;<i> * There's this long-standing issue of the fact that none of the
</I>&gt;<i>    character sequences which identify the start of a non-text line type
</I>&gt;<i>    were originally defined with spaces after them, but we've added that
</I>&gt;<i>    requirement hodge-podge as ambiguities have appeared, and now we're in
</I>&gt;<i>    a situation where half the line types need them and half don't.
</I>&gt;<i>    Consistency suggests we require spaces everywhere, but this has been
</I>&gt;<i>    surprisingly controversial and may break some things.  But a final
</I>&gt;<i>    ruling is required.
</I>
I've been wondering about this...  Specifically, in these example scenarios:

Sans whitespace: &gt;This is a quote
With whitespace: &gt; This is a quote

Should these two be parsed the same or should one include leading 
whitespace?

-----

Also, are you open to suggestions/additions to the text/gemini format?

Kind regards,
Kiba
</PRE>
