<PRE>Historically, efforts to establish a common logging format for Gemini
have not been well received.  I think there's already too much diversity
out there and server authors are reluctant to change.  The question of
whether or not IP addresses should be routinely logged also usually
proves quite divisive.

I still think there's value in such a standard (as it allows for
reusable log processing tools), but I definitely think it's out of scope
for the protocol spec proper and belongs in a companion spec.  I think
those are better suited to [tech] than [spec]?

For the record, I don't like that the Apache format uses spaces as a
field separator when spaces also occur inside the date.  Molly Brown's
log format uses tabs as separators, so it works very nicely with the
standard `cut` utility.  I use `cut`, `grep`, `sort`, `uniq` and `wc -l`
in short pipelines to run queries on my logs, and really enjoy being
able to do so.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
