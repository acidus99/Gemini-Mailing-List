 &gt; @all:  Does anyone know how to make links from gemini URLs in 
Markdown files so it will render in the browser?

gemini schema?

For markdown or html files to work correctly, they would have to be 
rendered by the client. The default trick that most clients have to deal 
with unknown mime format is to open them in an external application. But 
that won't work properly - any relative path links won't work correctly.

There is a fair amount of html being served in gemini and the occasional 
bit of markdown too. GUS has some content type statistics here:

   <A HREF="gemini://gus.guru/statistics">gemini://gus.guru/statistics</A>

There are a couple of clients that directly support these formats, but 
much less so compared to text/gemini which is supported by all. The ones 
I know of (there may well be others) are:

render text/html: Kristall, GemiNaut, Diohsc (via converter)
render text/markdown: Kristall

Client authors could plug in an converter into their pipeline if they 
wish, as a way to display such content in a client that only supports 
gemtext. There are converters you can use, such as md2gemini and 
html2gmi for that.

But I think for now, most clients will simply render text/html and 
text/markdown as plain text (not interpreted).
