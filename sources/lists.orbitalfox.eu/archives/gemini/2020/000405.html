Got it, thanks for clarifying.

We'll never be able to stop people going nuts and defining their own
structure on top of the official structure in the spec if they really
want to, but I think if the official spec can define a perfectly flat
structure (such that actually building an AST is unnecessary) which is
rich enough to take care of the most compelling styling that's needed to
achieve good readability, then that's absolutely fine.  There's no need
to have a concept of a list encapsulating consecutive list items in
order to implement the clean formatting I discussed previously, so I
think we can do without it.  It might feel weird compared to HTML or
LaTeX, but if it works, where's the problem?  I think this is how lists
work in common troff macros, actually, but I can't swear to it.
 
&gt;<i> I'm willing to admit that HTML has perhaps tainted my thinking here, but it

</I>
In the rough spec I sent around for this line-oriented syntax, each line
*isn't* a new paragraph in any meaningful sense.  If you want vertical
whitespace between two parts of text which correspond to different lines
before wrapping, you need to put a blank line in between them.  This
facilitatess things like
one
word
per
line
for emphasis, acrostic poems, etc.

&gt;<i> When a client is wrapping a line longer than the viewport, the client may chose
</I>&gt;<i> to add indents or other visual indicators to distinguish the beginning of the
</I>&gt;<i> line from a continuation line. The simplest way to do this would be by adding a
</I>&gt;<i> hanging indent to continuation lines.
</I>
Hmm.  An elegant idea, but I guess it would look quite strange for
ordinary text?

&gt;<i> Expanding on my previous code example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ```
</I>&gt;<i> def display_paragraph(line):
</I>&gt;<i>     # Strip leading and trailing whitespace
</I>&gt;<i>     line = line.strip()
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     initial_indent = ''
</I>&gt;<i>     subsequent_indent = '    '
</I>&gt;<i>     wrapped_text = textwrap.wrap(line, initial_indent, subsequent_indent)
</I>&gt;<i>     for line in wrapped_text:
</I>&gt;<i>         print(line)
</I>&gt;<i> ```
</I>
Aah!!!  I hadn't noticed that initial_indent, subsequent_indent feature
of textwrap.wrap.  That makes handling unordered list items in the
proposed way absolutely trivial!

def display_unordered_list_item(line):
    # Strip * and any whitespace
    line = line[1:].strip()
    print(textwrap.fill(line, viewportwidth-2, &quot;* &quot;, &quot; &quot;)
