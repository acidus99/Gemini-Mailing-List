<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Matthew Graybosch once stated:

  I'll keep that in mind if the idea proves popular.

</I>
  One of Sir Tim Berners-Lee's initial ideas for HTTP was to allow the user
to edit the page in the browser and have that update the file on the server. 
HTTP didn't get this capability until May of 1996 [1] where various methods
were defined that included PUT and DELETE.  It's sad to think that no
browsers at that time even attempted to do that [2].  Instead, we kept on
using FTP, later sftp and maybe even rsync for the technically minded.

  As I mentioned, I know of at least two other people working on this
concept [3], and the notion that having a single tool (even if it just
shells out for the editing portion) might be a good idea to reduce friction. 
And the non-Unix thing is a bonus (but I wasn't even thinking in that
direction).

[1]	RFC-1945 which describes HTTP/1.0.

[2]	Although if anyone knows of a browser that did, I'd like to know
	about it.

[3]	To support a wiki on Gemini.
