can't you simply set up different version revisions, though, for that?
maybe just a &quot;gemini-stable&quot; and &quot;gemini-next&quot; branch, where gemini-next is explictly experimental and can change at any time,
and ideas from there that work, can be cycled into gemini-stable at some kinda-set intervals?

</I>
I think it'd be best if it returned an (optional?) timeout/expiry info, for the tag (if not optional, 0 or -1 can signify infinite time), not sure what time unit, probably just seconds, though &quot;1h&quot; for 1 hour, and such is also possible
that way the server can specify if it should be flagged as missing for the next hour, or next day, or forevermore, etc, 
useful in cases that you temporarily take down a page for whatever reason, or where you might change urls every so often, or if you're simply prone to typos and sometimes fumble the links, and don't want to bother to manually ask for re-index... sometime you might not even know that a page is not crawled by some crawler...

also while probably not necessarily part of the spec, what should be the case if there's a redirect to a nonexistant URL?
should the url that was redirected FROM, be permanently &quot;not found&quot; as well?

and if it's intended for non-human agents, maybe mention that, too? that human-controlled clients are allowed to re-request on demand and don't have to block it forever?

&quot;client error&quot; makes more sense than &quot;permanent error&quot; in this case, too
