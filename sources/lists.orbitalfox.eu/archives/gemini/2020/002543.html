<PRE>Sorry, that could have been me, dragonstone still generates certificates 
without a subject (And it won't be updated since I'm currently working 
on it successor).
Also there should be s little information as possible stored in the 
client certificates since they get transmitted in the clear to avoid 
giving away extra data to someone who is &quot;just&quot; eavesdropping without 
messing with the connection itself (and therefore having a pretty good 
chance of staying undetected).

Have a nice day!

P.s. Apologies to Sean for sending a duplicated mail, I apparently still 
manage to hit the wrong reply button in thunderbird
