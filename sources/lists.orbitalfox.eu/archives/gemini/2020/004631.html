&gt;<i> If you chose such a link, you'd in principle get all 40,000+ document

</I>&gt;<i> will be a different link altogether for interactive search, where you
</I>&gt;<i> would be asked using a 10 response to enter keywords from the metadata
</I>&gt;<i> (language, author, title, Library of Congress subject classification,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.)
</I>
You could just combine the two pages and return a 10 when no query
string is provided to advsearch.gmi.

&gt;<i> However, that's inherently less precise: if you provided keywords
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Mark Twain&quot;, you'd get both books by him and books about him, such as
</I>&gt;<i> _My Mark Twain_ by William Dean Howells.
</I>
So you provide no interactive way to create an advanced search filter,
and you are replacing it with an interactive way to create not an
advanced search filter.

&gt;<i> With so many pages to search, all the search terms are ANDed together:
</I>&gt;<i> the more keywords, the less output to look through.  (I'm not sure
</I>&gt;<i> what the upper limit on results will be: for Google it's 1000.)  You
</I>&gt;<i> probably don't want all the works by one author anyhow: you want the
</I>&gt;<i> ones you can read.
</I>
You could simply prioritize books written in the language of the
interface - so with the fr.gemguten.example.com/author/Jules%20Verne.gmi
page, French books would show up at the top.  But this solution doesn't
scale to finding books in an arbitrary language.

&gt;<i> The search engine doesn't know what the link looks like.  I suppose
</I>&gt;<i> that could be passed in the query too: &quot;...
</I>&gt;<i> &amp;linktext=Les%20oeuvres%20de%20Jules%20Verne%20en%20fran&#231;ais&quot;, for
</I>&gt;<i> example.
</I>
The server is smart enough to generate something along those lines on
its own.  Please don't make URLs that much longer.

&gt;<i> Fine as far as the error messages are concerned.  But just because you
</I>&gt;<i> want a French interface, it doesn't necessarily mean you want to
</I>&gt;<i> reject English or German books from the search.
</I>
Of course not.  The interface language is completely dissociated from
the actual content of the pages, it only affects the language they are
written in.
