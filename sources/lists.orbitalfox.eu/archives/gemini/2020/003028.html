</I>
I think this is an apples to oranges comparison; 5.5.2 has to do with the text/gemini media type, which, while it is a part of the spec, isn't protocol based (i.e; I could serve text/gemini on a web server if I really wanted to)

&gt;&gt;<i> The spec was created around August of 2019 (at least, the list was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first posted to in mid-August). It's only a year old. If a breaking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change *needs* to be made, it's not too late yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If a crucial change were to be made, of course, I'm all for it, but in
</I>&gt;<i> my opinion, it seems that there is no need for any more features to be
</I>&gt;<i> added, and the way I see it is moving towards stabilizing the spec
</I>&gt;<i> without any breaking changes, that's just my opinion.
</I>
I agreed with you on that point though; this isn't needed, at least not yet. But if the breaking change needed to be made, like you said, it should be made. This attitude of &quot;oh, we don't need anything else&quot; might convince some people who otherwise would have had good suggestions to back away; after all, if we aren't adding new features, why bother giving your suggestion?

&gt;&gt;<i> That's not really a good comparison. Obviously you wouldn't add
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> revision control and/or a remote shell to Gemini; that has nothing to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do with serving content. But if the X in &quot;gemini + X&quot; has to do with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> content (serving it, etc.), it's worth considering.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I may have went to the extreme with this, but take a look at web land,
</I>&gt;<i> there's applications written to entirely run on the web, those include
</I>&gt;<i> mail readers, video and music players (implemented in JS), document
</I>&gt;<i> editors (Google docs and whatnot), and finally, control panels which
</I>&gt;<i> serve the purpose of a remote shell, obviously, that's not SSH, but if
</I>&gt;<i> more and more features get accepted to the protocol, how long until
</I>&gt;<i> that becomes possible?
</I>
Just for the sake of it, I really want to try and make a remote shell in Gemini CGI, just to prove a point. You can do it already, with the protocol as-is; send the command as a query to a CGI endpoint

&gt;<i> Applications can be implemented in Gemini currently, using CGI, these
</I>&gt;<i> applications don't have to do with serving content, you could implement
</I>&gt;<i> a calculator, a banner generator, and a git repository viewer, all
</I>&gt;<i> using what is currently available, I have no argument against
</I>&gt;<i> implementing such applications using CGI which currently allows
</I>&gt;<i> extending the protocol without requiring more features to be added.
</I>
Okay, but with all due respect, what does that have to do with content size? CGI isn't going to help the fact that the protocol currently has no way to indicate &quot;this is how big the response will be&quot; or &quot;this is the hash of the file&quot;. Those questions, at least in my opinion, need to be answered at the protocol level, unless we're going to make a .well-known for Gemini.

Just my two cents,
