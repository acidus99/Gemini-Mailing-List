  There's a reason why UTF-8 was selected as the default character set for
text/gemini, and one of those is to allow other people than English speakers
a means of expressing themsevles [1].  I don't think it's entirely
unreasonable to expect such a person to use Unicode for both domain name and
filenames [2].  Yes, tooling could be made to handle &quot;canonicalizing&quot; links
[3] but why not look into allowing IRIs?  Without an attempt at it, it would
be difficult to know what would work, what doesn't and where the difficulty,
if any, lie.  *That's* why I'm so insistent on coding up
&quot;proof-of-concepts&quot;.  Just decreeing &quot;this is how it shall be done&quot; rarely
works out well [4].  And decreeing &quot;this shall NOT be done&quot; could put off
non-technical, non-English speaking people. [5]

&gt;<i> I don't think the idea of &quot;de facto standards&quot; fits within the Gemini
</I>&gt;<i> ethos at all. It's not supposed to be extensible and clients aren't
</I>&gt;<i> supposed go off and do random things while others have to decide what to
</I>&gt;<i> do and play catch-up. That is how the Web grew and became more complex,
</I>&gt;<i> and it's why we have only a few browsers today.
</I>
  And this is working out if the specification should be ammended to allow
IRIs, and if not, at at least have a jutification.

&gt;<i> The ecosystem benefits when we all just stick to the standard, with the
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps obvious exception of demos and toys.
</I>
  One more point of reference.  The Gopher RFC (RFC-1436) states the use of
ISO-8859-1 for a character set.  It is wrong then, for gopher servers to
serve up UTF-8 documents even though it's not standard?  Yes, gopher is not
Gemini, but UTF-8 does seem to be a modern &quot;de facto standard&quot; in
gopherspace.

[1]	For example, <A HREF="gemini://blekksprut.net/">gemini://blekksprut.net/</A>

[2]	Otherwise, punycode wouldn't exist.

[3]	Conversion from IRI to URI, with Unicode normalization,  prior to
	publication.

[4]	Such as X.200---lovingly developed and standardized but no one used
	it.  Or Xanadu.  Over 60 years of design work and still not working.

[5]	And I'm saying this being a thoroughly American mut that speaks only
	English.
