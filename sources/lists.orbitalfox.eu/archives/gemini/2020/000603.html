<PRE>Hello all

Just recently joined your email list after lurking for a while (via HN). 
I like the look of gemini, hopefully it can hit a sweet spot of simple 
hypertext without the baggage of the full web infrastructure. I think 
gemini is interesting. And I particularly have enjoyed reading the 
discussion about text formatting and bullets... no, seriously.

I'm interested in user interfaces and cognitive aspects of hypertext 
among other things.

My question is really about how we can support cognitive aspects of user 
navigation through gemini-space. I understand and largely endorse the 
reasons for the simple text based protocol and format. However at the 
moment, browsing gemini-space is a very homogenous experience (each page 
looks the same as others). So it is not so clear to the user whose page 
you are on.

On the wider web, there is a stronger notion of place, which has become 
very brand heavy and each website is a graphic masterpiece in its own 
right. There is a &quot;cost&quot; to that clearly.

Is there a simple and gemini-friendly way for us to (optionally!) convey 
this sense of place. For example, to set a simple global favicon or 
background colour for pages on a certain site. It could help with user's 
task of navigation and understanding exactly where they are. I know 
there are lots of CLI junkies around here, so maybe this hasn't been a 
priority so far.

I'm not proposing anything heavy or like the www, but I feel there could 
be some simple sweet spot here to be investigated.

Best wishes

   - Luke
