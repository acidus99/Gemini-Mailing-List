Can I still keep this thread &quot;open&quot;, at least to give a &quot;theoretical&quot;
alternative?  (Just talking about the alternative, although not using
it, could give us an insight of what might be nice to have in a future
iteration.)

(I don't think I'll be posting much on this, except after I get some
feedback from the cryptographers community.)

</I>
It's not like there are hundreds of client and server implementations...  :)




&gt;<i> There is a very real chance that this kind of change would

</I>&gt;<i> fork.
</I>

This is perhaps true;  although as said, with strong consensus, I
don't think that would happen.

Ciprian.
