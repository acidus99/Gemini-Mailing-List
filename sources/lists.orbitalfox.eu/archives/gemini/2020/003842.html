<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; And it is even more important for people who use scripts like arabic,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chinese, devanageri, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am to be convinced that unicode URLs are a good thing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And I say that as a native speaker of a language which
</I>&gt;<i> includes glyphs which aren't in US ASCII.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An URL is an address, in the same way that a phone
</I>&gt;<i> number or an IP is an address. Ideally these are globally
</I>&gt;<i> unique, unambiguous and representable everywhere.
</I>&gt;<i> This address scheme should be independent of a localisation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We don't insist that phone numbers are rendered in roman
</I>&gt;<i> numerals either. My dialing prefix isn't +XXVII. The
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> prefix isn't <A HREF="tweeling://">tweeling://</A> in dutch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using unicode in addresses balkanises this global space into
</I>&gt;<i> separate little domains, with subtle ambiguities (is the
</I>&gt;<i> cyrilic C the same as a latin - C, who knows ?), reducing
</I>&gt;<i> security, and making crossover harder. If somebody points
</I>&gt;<i> me at an url in kanji or ethiopian, I would have great
</I>&gt;<i> difficulty remembering nevermind recreating it, even if the 
</I>&gt;<i> photo there is useful to the rest of the world. If you 
</I>&gt;<i> are saying what about the guy from Ethiopia - well, I suspect he
</I>&gt;<i> would have trouble with kanji too... without a common
</I>&gt;<i> denominator this is an N^2 problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I appreciate that many languages are in decline and even
</I>&gt;<i> facing extinction - but interacting with the internet requires
</I>&gt;<i> a jargon or specialisation anyway, in the same way that botanists
</I>&gt;<i> invoke latin names, mathematicians write about eigenvectors
</I>&gt;<i> and brain surgeons talk about the hippocampus, all regardless
</I>&gt;<i> of which languages they speak at home.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> TLDR: The words after the gemini =&gt; link can be unicode, the
</I>&gt;<i> link itself should not.
</I>
I mostly agree with this in the sense that the protocol and text/gemini
should stick to URLs that are URI-safe (nothing outside the safe
80-something characters).

That said, I don't think there's anything wrong with a friendly client
showing percent-decoded unicode representations of a path or
punycode-decoded representations of an international domain name in the
address bar or anywhere else in the interface.

In the same vein, if a server wants to be extra friendly to gmi file
authors, it can, like I suggested earlier, allow users to name and link
to files in unicode, but percent-encode everything before sending it to
over the wire. I actually implemented this in my personal gemini server
today, and it was a trivial change (especially when compared to what I'd
have to do to properly validate IRIs...), allowing me to write &quot;=&gt; &#38609;&#24565;/
&#38609;&#24565;&quot; and have it sent to the client as &quot;=&gt; %e%9b%91%e5%bf%b5/ &#38609;&#24565;&quot;.
