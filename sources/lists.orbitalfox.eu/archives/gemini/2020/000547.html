<PRE>Howdy!

FWIW I had a very pleasant experience with Asuka client. It has no package
available for download but it's in Rust and can be built by a relatively
unskilled person. Some documentation on how one would build it is missing
but I'm sure this is something that can be remedied without much effort.

Instruction pretty much boils down to:
1. Run rustup
2. Get the code
3. Run cargo build
4. Done.

The undocumented part is between 2 and 3:
* on Windows, change dependencies to pancurses (I should send a patch)
* on Linux, `sudo apt install ...` some dependencies (needs documenting)

But yeah, in an ideal world there would be a package ready for download.

You can find it here: <A HREF="gemini://vi.rs">gemini://vi.rs</A>  I'm using Let's Encrypt TLS certs with a modified Pollux. I've been watching the Gemini project for months now and I like where it is headed. I chose to publish using only Gemini because it is the closest user-sovereign publishing system we have ATM.

</I>&gt;<i> The only problem now is that lots of people have asked me what they can download and run to read my Gemini &quot;mission log&quot;. There aren't any precompiled packages or installers so I've been having them ssh to kiosk to run the VP client. Is anybody planning to publish packages/installers anytime soon? I've had several thousand hits on my Gemini space in the last couple of days despite the hurdles for getting onto Gemini. Castor is hosted on sr.ht that has CI capabilities. I'm familiar with setting up CI builds on Github but not on sr.ht. Does anybody know how to set that up and is willing to send a patch to the maintainer of Castor?
