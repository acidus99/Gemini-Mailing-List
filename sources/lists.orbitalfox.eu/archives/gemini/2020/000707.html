<PRE>Might as well join in on the announcements bandwagon. :p

I'm hosting a server at <A HREF="gemini://park-city.club.">gemini://park-city.club.</A> It's for the &quot;netgroup&quot;/not-quite-pubnix that I admin, Park City. We're a *lot* more active at <A HREF="https://park-city.club,">https://park-city.club,</A> but we have a small-but-respectable gopher presence as well. I'm mostly planning on having the Gemini server be a rehost of the Gopher content, with perhaps some of the HTML content as well if I can get that working smoothly enough.

Right now we're using molly-brown as our server, as it just worked really. I only set it up yesterday, so the only thing we're hosting at the moment is a rehost of my personal phlog (which i need to move to my tilde still) and some experiments with color and inline graphics. I'll try to add some more stuff moving forwards, but maintaining content for three protocols is a *bit* tricky.

Some of the other park city members were commenting that they'd be more likely to use Gemini if they had a way to set background/text colors and give their pages a *little* bit of flair. The HTML versions of cosmic.voyage and gemini.circumlunar.space were pointed out as good examples. I know that's not exactly what the standard is aiming for, but I do understand their concern over wanting to personalize their space a *little* bit. But I'm sure we'll play around and see what we can make regardless.

I can't wait to see where the Gemini project goes. There's a lot of potential here.
