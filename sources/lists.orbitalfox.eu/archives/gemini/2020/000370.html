Me too!  Although I'm still very keen to hear from jmcbray on these
recent developments.  I *suspect* they'll be happy.  But I really don't
want to rush into this.

But I am amazed at how much more tractable getting away from
gopher-style hard wrapping has made this whole discussion.  It has made
it obvious to me that the problem all along has been with determining
the scope of special features.

Consider bulleted lists, with hard-wrapping.  Suppose we have this
content, hard wrapped to 40 characters, and our viewport is 60
characters so we want to combine lines:

* To demonstrate endurance of humans and    | Line 1
equipment in spaceflight for extended       | 2
periods, at least eight days required       | 3
for a Moon landing, to a maximum of two     | 4
weeks                                       | 5
* To effect rendezvous and docking with     | 6
another vehicle, and to maneuver the        | 7
combined spacecraft using the               | 8
propulsion system of the target vehicle     | 9
* To demonstrate Extra-Vehicular            | 10
Activity (EVA), or space-&quot;walks&quot; outside    |
the protection of the spacecraft, and to    |
evaluate the astronauts' ability to         |
perform tasks there * To perfect            |
techniques of atmospheric reentry and       |
touchdown at a pre-selected location on     |
land                                        |

Any old client can recognise that Line 1 is a list item by virtue of
the leading *.  But in order for a client to do a nice job of
reformatting this list to 60 chars, it has to understand that lines 1
through 5 constitute a single list item (i.e. that this is the scope of
the * in line 1), and that lines 2-5 are not an independent paragraph
of text coming after a list with only a single item.  To a human, this
is obvious, even if they can't read English, because the list items at
lines 6 and 10 make it clear.  But to a parser, at the time it
encounters line 2, it has no idea what's in lines 6 or 10.  So parsing
requires looking ahead, and understanding rules like &quot;Once started, a
list item continues until we encounter either a new list item or a blank
line&quot;.  It's exactly that kind of fiddly rule that I was terrified of
filling the spec with earlier.

In HTML, the scoping problem is trivial, because there are explicit
beginning and tags, &lt;li&gt; and &lt;/li&gt;.  Markdown gets rid of these for
visual lightness (great!), but that scoping information is still
essential.  In Markdown it's in there implicitly for a sufficiently
complicated (bad!) parser which understands the concept of blocks
(which can be nested).  So Markdown trades the visual complexity of
HTML for conceptual complexity that makes it a pain to parse.

The syntax we're now talking about, where scope is limited to a single
line, is such an elegant alternative to both of these!  One way to think
about it is that things like =&gt;, * and # are differnet kinds of opening
tag but they all have the same closing tag, which is \n.  Because there
are opening and closing tags, the parsing is easy, like HTML.  But
because our closing tags are invisible and need to be there anyway, we
get ease of authoring and visual lightness like Markdown.  It's the best
of both worlds.

I'm so glad we hit upon this before I ran out of patience and just
declared Gopher-style plain text hard wrapping to be the final decision!
Thanks to everybody who steered the conversation in this direction.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
