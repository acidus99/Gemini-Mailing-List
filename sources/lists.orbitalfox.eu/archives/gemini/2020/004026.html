The thing I've worked out so far for myself is based on the use of a 
content management system called Logarion (written in Ocaml by Orbifx). 
I first run it to create a new document based on a title I give. Once 
the file is made I edit it locally with nano, basically in Gemini format 
minus Logarion's header. (The documents are meant to be in Markdown, but 
Gemini is like a subset of that anyway.)

When the document is written and marked for publication in its header, I 
run a script which calls Logarion to export them to GMI along with an 
index listing ordered by date (date.gmi) that Logarion itself provides. 
The script then copies the generated content into a directory on my 
server, and as such it is published.

I've been thinking about devising a minimalist alternative to this 
workflow because it's a little bit overkill for what I'm doing. My 
thought is that the least a Gemini site or log requires is:

* A server-generated directory listening in reverse alphabetical order
* Hand-written files whose names begin with their ISO date at least, 
hopefully with a title after.

This way all you really need is a text editor and nothing more, and just 
create an entry by running `nano '2020-12-10 Hello, World!.gmi'` (OK not 
sure if putting an exclamation point in a file name is reasonable, but 
whatever.)

The idea is people will go to the root directory of your log and get a 
nice and tidy human-readable index that they can browse from the top 
down... you just write content and don't worry about navigation.
