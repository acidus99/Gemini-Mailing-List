<PRE>Hi,

after a long time of lurking on this list, I've finally installed jetforce on
my server [1]. There is not much to see at the moment, but I'm working on it.

I've also implemented rudimentary gemini support in my gopher client ncgopher [2].
There are still a lot of rough edges, especially some keyboard commands that only
work on gophermaps and not on gemini, but it's getting better every day. I pretty
much use ncgopher as my primary gemini client and fix what comes along.

One of the issues that has come up with other clients is that they block
on binary downloads. ncgopher downloads files in background, indicating
the number of bytes read (a bit like lynx). This way, you can continue browsing
while downloading your favourite konpeito mix.

ncgopher is written in Rust, which some people hate and others love. I started
to implement this client to teach myself rust, so it's far from perfect.

However, the client is known to compile on FreeBSD (my primary system), OpenBSD,
Linux (tested on Debian and Arch), and OS X. Maybe Windows works as well.

More features will be coming available in the next weeks. Feel free to create
an issue on [2], if you encounter any bugs.

- Jan
