</I>
I think this is the best summary of the overall project direction. I
quoted just a bit but maybe the whole paragraph could find its way in
the Gemini FAQ or in a Gemini &quot;vision&quot; document. I _did_ read as much
as I could before posting but didn't see this orientation as clearly
stated.elsewhere.

&gt;<i> I am happy to make it simpler, more beautiful,
</I>&gt;<i> more hackable, more general purpose, friendlier to low power computers
</I>&gt;<i> and slow networks, to whatever extent is possible without interfering
</I>&gt;<i> with its seaworthiness as a lifeboat. [...]
</I>&gt;<i> But throwing out TLS so that it can be more readily implemented by
</I>&gt;<i> somebody who just learned what a socket is yesterday is ultimately
</I>&gt;<i> self-defeating from the lifeboat perspective.
</I>
Please note that my initial post was just a question: &quot;Is this Mercury
concept still alive and are members of the community interested in
it?&quot;

I _did not_ suggest to &quot;throw out TLS&quot; and made it clear in the
following discussion that my &quot;gripe&quot; (if I may say!) was not with TLS
but with _mandatory_ TLS.

I just happen to think that the initial http/https was not such a bad
thing, contrary to the orthodox view in the HTTPS/Web world of today
-- I won't explain why I think that because I don't want to pour more
oil on the fire :-)

&gt;<i> The mandatory encryption in Gemini is an
</I>&gt;<i> important, functional, deliberate part of the lifeboat design.  It would
</I>&gt;<i> be a bad lifeboat without out.
</I>
Good. It clarifies things. Maybe this (and other parts of your answer)
could be prepended to the Mercury document as a caveat / &quot;note to the
reader&quot;
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When we *do* chase improvements in these other regards without
</I>&gt;<i> compromising our role as a lifeboat, we also need to keep a sense of
</I>&gt;<i> perspective, make our criteria clear, make measurements and not trust
</I>&gt;<i> our guts, etc.  I'm all for a lower power, greener internet.  But if you
</I>&gt;<i> really want to push in that direction hard, you need to make radical
</I>&gt;<i> departures from the basic paradigms that the web and Gemini are both
</I>&gt;<i> built around.
</I>&gt;<i> [...]Gemini is
</I>&gt;<i> never going to be the absolute best choice for low power consumption,
</I>&gt;<i> for low bandwidth, etc.  That's not so say we shouldn't give those
</I>&gt;<i> things any thought, but we needn't bend over backward for 1% or 2%
</I>&gt;<i> savings because it just doesn't make sense.  We should concern ourselves
</I>&gt;<i> with the &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; of these problems.
</I>
Maybe the whole discussion got side-tracked by my SUV analogy.  It was
mostly intended as a joke.
I then made the mistake of answering too seriously to your &quot;please
disambiguate&quot; question. I am sorry for that.

BTW I loved your &quot;vegans carrying loads of USB keys on their bikes&quot;.
Good one! :-)
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Be aware that &quot;Mercury&quot;, as I sketched it, was a &quot;conceptual
</I>&gt;<i> navigational aid&quot; for me to try to grapple with the question of whether
</I>&gt;<i> or not Gemini was becoming &quot;too complex&quot; (and one that most people - not
</I>&gt;<i> all, but most - had a very negative reaction to).
</I>
I didn't know that. I guess this is why I asked on the mailing list. I
do understand now that it is a touchy subject. I am sorry for the
noise.

&gt;<i> I think that's all I have to say on this matter.
</I>
Heard you loud and clear ;-)
