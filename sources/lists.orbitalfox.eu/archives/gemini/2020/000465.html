<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Ciprian Dorin Craciun once stated:
&gt;<i> So I've taken Sean Conner advice and implemented a proof-of-concept
</I>&gt;<i> client and server (only the protocol, transport and crypto part, not
</I>&gt;<i> the actual file serving) in Python by replacing TLS with NaCL /
</I>&gt;<i> `libsodium`.
</I>
  Wow.  For that I thank you.  Now there's something to actually look at. I
do have a few questions about the code as I'm looking over it.  Prepare for
lots of questions.  I had them for solderpunk as well.

1) I assume the 32-bit length is sent bigendian (if I understand the
argument to struct.pack() and struct.unpack() correctly---I'm not a Python
programmer).  Why big endian?  99% of all computers on the Internet today is
little endian (x86) so it seems to me that sending it little endian would be
better.  [1][2]

2) As I feared, this requires a more complicated implementation.  solderpunk
wanted a protocol that could be implemented quickly and while TLS might be a
bad protocol, it at least has the feature of being widely available and
largly transparent if done correctly (like libtls, part of LibreSSL, does). 
It handles not only the crypo portion, but the framing of data (invisibly to
the rest of the application).  To tell the truth, I don't know the actual
bytes of the TLS portion of the protcol as that is handled for me.

  In fact, that's part of why HTTPS was so successful---it doesn't change
the HTTP protocol at all.  It just slips in between TCP and HTTP and is
transparent to both.

  [ snip ]

&gt;<i> I hope I haven't made too many mistakes, and I hope this is useful as
</I>&gt;<i> a proof-of-concept that one could replace TLS for such simpler
</I>&gt;<i> protocols,
</I>
  I know that given the self-sign certificate nature of Gemini decreases
security a bit (TOFU and all that), not *all* Gemini servers are using
self-signed certificates.  There's at least two that I know of that use
actual signed certificates (from Let's Encrypt), and for my own server, I
use a signed certificate from my own CA (technically, the certificate isn't
self-signed, but the CA is self-certificed).  With a signed certificate, you
get *some* assurance that the server you are talking to is the server you
expect to be talking to, but it's still, technically, subject to a MITM
attack (either at the corporate level, or at the state level---it's way less
likely to come from some random hacker).

  What's still missing from your proof-of-concept though, is support for
client certificates.  Yes, you have the &quot;transient&quot; stuff working, but for
my Gemini server, I have a second that is unavailable unless you have a
signed certificate from me.  Send in a certificate request, I generate the
certificate and send that back, and you can access the sooperseecret portion
of my site [3] (no one has done that yet; then again, I haven't exactly
advertised that I would do that either).

  This way, I can control who has access to what on my Gemini server in a
mostly stateless way (I don't have to maintain a database of userids and
passwords, just pass out certificates which can be revoked if needed, and
will expire after a period of my choosing).  Yes, that complicated *my* end,
and may complicate a client that wants to support that, but it doesn't
complicate the *protocol* at all---TLS provides all the machinery for that.

  I'm still going over your code, but I'm not sure I can run it.  For one, I
don't know which version of Python (I know there are major differences
between 2 and 3 and I think I only have 2.something---I don't program in
Python) and I don't have libsodium install (but I do have NaCL).  But again,
I thank you for doing this work and giving us something tangible to look at
and run.

[1]	Okay, I happen to agree with the big endian choice, but that's
	because I'm biased---binary based Internet protocols are all big
	endian, and I have a soft spot for the Motorola CPUs of past.  I've
	never been a fan of little endian personally.

[2]	I'm also asking to reflect back to you the same argument you
	presented with using CRLF.  Your big endian choice seems to be
	&quot;because that's how all Internet protocols do it&quot;.
