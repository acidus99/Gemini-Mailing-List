This is correct!  The new lightweight feed idea is *not* supposed to
replace Atom, which is considerably more powerful and flexible.  The
idea is simply to make it possible to subscribe to even very simple
static gemlogs which are maintained by hand, so people are not forced to
choose between tedious handwriting of XML, running fragile scripts which
attempt to guess a post's timestamp from the filesystem metadata (which
is too easily changed by accident) or the filename (which encourages
longer, uglier URLs), or running a CMS or static site generator (which
they might perceive as over-complicated or over-opinionated), just to
make sure people are able to follow their writing.

If a site *is* being generated by a CMS or static site generator,
there's no reason for it not to provide Atom feeds.

Cheers,
