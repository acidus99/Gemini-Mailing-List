<PRE>Hi all,

In service of some recent discussion about replies in Geminispace [0]
[1] [2], I wanted to share a bit about a new feature on GUS.
Specifically, backlinks. It's live, you can go try it out right now if
you want [a], and I think it provides one possible solution to finding
replies to posts in Geminispace.

First, what are backlinks? Take, for example, page A. Now let's say
there are three pages B, C, and D, all of which link to page A. In
this situation we define B, C, and D as A's backlinks.

I think this could be interesting information in a general sense, if
you as a content author simply want to know what pages link to you.
But since most (I think?) reply-type posts link to the original post
they're replying to, that means they will get surfaced by this
functionality too. So, if you want to see replies to post &quot;foo&quot;,
simply look at the backlinks for that page on GUS.

I have some ideas for functionality that could be built on top of this
feature, if it sticks around. For example, maybe there's finally a use
for certificate auth on GUS, so folks could create &quot;accounts,&quot; specify
URLs and domains that they care about, and get some sort of
notification when new backlinks are discovered for those URLs or
domains.

There are some definite pros and cons to this solution to the &quot;replies
in Geminispace&quot; problem, but in the spirit of experimentation, I've
built a quick version of it and put it out there for some
experimentation. Please let me your thoughts!

[a] documentation for the feature is at <A HREF="gemini://gus.guru/about">gemini://gus.guru/about</A> - but
the TLDR is: perform a GUS search, click the link to enter verbose
mode, and now you should see links to backlinks pages for each result
that has backlinks.
