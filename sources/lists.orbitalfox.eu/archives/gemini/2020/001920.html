</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By checking on several server on a dedicate page of known public keys?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all of this...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, I'll be replying to several of your messages here because I'm
</I>&gt;<i> getting mixed signals here. And then I can answer your questions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It will also permit surfing at the speed of ligth with instant display of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clicked link... something that is no more existing in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; old-school-too-much dynamic web.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Having TLS is better, but it come with a latency cost with the one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connection per request behavior. Freedom is also having the choice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems a primary concern of yours is overhead of establishing a
</I>&gt;<i> connection. Well, TCP itself has overhead---three packets (at 40 bytes per)
</I>&gt;<i> before the connection is considered &quot;up&quot;. Yes, TLS increaases that bit
</I>&gt;<i> more, but to say that there will be no latency without TLS is not a good
</I>&gt;<i> argument. UDP has no latency, but there are other issues with using it [1].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Continuing ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Optional PGP signature is enough to provide integrity.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are you sure that TLS is safe? States are allowing communication they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can't decipher?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The fun fact is:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -   with TLS, the whole server is using only one certficat and the integrity
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     of publication rely only on this security and you don't know if it is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     compromised server.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -   with PGP signature, each writer using the server have his own certificat
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     to secure his writing integrity.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When you are reading pgp signed document from a server where you own a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; defined set of public pgp keys, you don't fear MITM attack (the same way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TLS is secure only with a PKI).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The difference is that external PGP signature are all computed only at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; document publication time and not on the fly for each user request.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It also seems you have reservations about the PKI infrastructure, which is
</I>&gt;<i> fine, I do too. It seems you really distrust TLS. Okay. But PGP (for GPG
</I>&gt;<i> for that matter) isn't the silver bullet you think it is. So let me answer
</I>&gt;<i> you questions now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By asking to you?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay.HOW do I get you the public key and ensure you have it correctly?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it's a public key, so there's no issue with people seeing it, but how
</I>&gt;<i> do you know I am the one giving you the key?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only way I know of to be 100% certain is to exchange keys in person.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By checking on <A HREF="https://keys.openpgp.org/?">https://keys.openpgp.org/?</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll throw your own statement back at you: &quot;you don't know if it is a
</I>&gt;<i> compromised server.&quot; I don't know, and I think you don't know either.
</I>&gt;<i> Again, your own words back at you: &quot;Are you sure that TLS is safe? States
</I>&gt;<i> are allowing communication they can't decipher?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By checking on several server on a dedicate page of known public keys?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Reduces the likelyhood of MITM, but still a pain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The hardest part of cryptography, by far, is key management. There is
</I>&gt;<i> still no good way to distribute public keys that aren't subject to various
</I>&gt;<i> attacks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -spc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [1] Namely, you open yourself up to participate in amplified denial of
</I>&gt;<i> service attacks. I used to run the QOTD service on UDP, until I
</I>&gt;<i> realized I was getting requests from forged IP addresses and sending
</I>&gt;<i> data to said forged IP addresses. This is why we can't have nice
</I>&gt;<i> things on the Internet. [2]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [2] QUIC. Yes, I know about it. Yes, I don't like it, and it will have
</I>&gt;<i> similar issues to TCP. Yeah, yeah, Google says it has 0-connection
</I>&gt;<i> overhead, but I don't know how hard it's been attacked yet. And
</I>&gt;<i> guess what? That's yet another library dependency for a &quot;simple
</I>&gt;<i> client&quot; because QUIC has no support in any kernel I know of, and
</I>&gt;<i> probably won't for several years. I also don't trust Google, but
</I>&gt;<i> that's my issue.
