If clients aren't free to cache, then I'm not free to save a .gmi file on
my file system.  That's all a client-side cache is.

&gt;<i> Consider using

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The advantages of not serving connections one by one is that it provides
better service to clients on a heavily-used server.  Right now there are no
heavily-used servers, but there's nothing in the Gemini ethos that says
&quot;documents should only be of interest to a few&quot;.  That's sheer elitism.

&gt;<i> Does everyone here require a lecture on why their desired features
</I>&gt;<i> aren't in the protocol yet?
</I>

Client caching has nothing to do with the protocol.  The idea of 22 is that
authors (not servers) may want to advise clients against caching in a
particular case.

Do you have anything else to help the community with?

&gt;<i> If any feature does not add a great value at an acceptable cost to the
</I>&gt;<i> simplicity of the protocol, consider it rejected before even proposing
</I>&gt;<i> it, I don't want to have a different experience browsing Gemini space
</I>&gt;<i> using netcat than using Kristall.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If you are browsing with netcat, caching is not even an issue.  If nobody
wanted to serve dynamic content, 22 wouldn't be useful.  It is handy for
those who do want to, to communicate their intent.  No client and no server
has to implement this.
