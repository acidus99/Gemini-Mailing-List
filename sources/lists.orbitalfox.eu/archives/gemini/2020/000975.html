<PRE>It was thus said that the Great plugd once stated:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Has anybody developed a general theory of specification creep? :-)
</I>
  Yes.  There's Zawinski's Law:  Every program attempts to expand until it
can read mail. Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones
which can.

  You can read some commentary about it from these links:

  -spc (Every program has at least one bug and can be shortened by at least
	one instruction---from which, by induction, one can deduce that
	every program can be reduced to one instruction which doesn't work. [1])

[1]	This actually happened.  Not to me, but I know of such a case.
