There is no need whatsoever for a crisis of confidence. I certainly have 
confidence in your approach to Gemini or I'd not have tried making a 
server in an uphill language like Erlang. The client certificate mechanism
is unfamiliar rather than complex. The unfamiliarity will run into 
friction in terms of developer resistance and the limitations of existing 
code and documentation, but those are only two among many elements in the 
tradeoff. Given time, the limitations of SSL libraries will be better 
understood or obviated.

Maybe the transient cert thing will take off; maybe it won't. Again, time 
will tell and it doesn't need to be resolved any time soon.

I have a pretty clear vision for what I'd like to be able to do with 
Gemini: have a visually tasteful, minimalist, distraction-free reading 
experience for content that is trivial to publish and trivial to keep just 
among my friends, and I feel the ecosystem will be there in a few months 
if not weeks.
