<PRE>Well, the reason I added a timeout to deedum was because some servers don't close the connection, and the client was much easier to write if the connection terminated.

So, first the ability to tell the user that the server was unresponsive vs asking them to wait for things to stream-in seems important, otherwise how long are they supposed to wait? What if the server just hits an infinite loop?

Yet I question the reason behind keeping an open connection. The ability of a client to render progressive docs, images or video is seems orthogonal to a status code that says this connection will not close. Some of the streaming things out there seem very... application-y, and getting away from the app platform that is the web was a major motivator for me to invest in gemini. This feels like comet which was basically ajax which made everything terrible. Just my ptsd though.
