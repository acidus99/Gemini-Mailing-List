<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Felix Quei&#223;ner once stated:
&gt;<i> Hey List!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While planning out the implementation of TOFU for Kristall, i noticed
</I>&gt;<i> something weird:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Quoting the spec:
</I>&gt;<i> ----------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> TOFU stands for &quot;Trust On First Use&quot; and is public-key security model
</I>&gt;<i> similar to that used by OpenSSH.  The first time a Gemini client
</I>&gt;<i> connects to a server, it accepts whatever certificate it is presented.
</I>&gt;<i> That certificate's fingerprint and expiry date are saved in a persistent
</I>&gt;<i> database (like the .known_hosts file for SSH), associated with the
</I>&gt;<i> server's hostname.  On all subsequent connections to that hostname, the
</I>&gt;<i> received certificate's fingerprint is computed and compared to the one
</I>&gt;<i> in the database.  If the certificate is not the one previously received,
</I>&gt;<i> but the previous certificate's expiry date has not passed, the user is
</I>&gt;<i> shown a warning, analogous to the one web browser users are shown when
</I>&gt;<i> receiving a certificate without a signature chain leading to a trusted CA.
</I>&gt;<i> ----------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This means that trust in a server is lost as soon as a certificate is
</I>&gt;<i> expired and a subsequent renewal of the certificate with the same
</I>&gt;<i> private key is the same as visiting the host for the first time. But
</I>&gt;<i> when i refresh my server certificate before it expires (which is
</I>&gt;<i> recommended), we will have the situation that the client will not trust
</I>&gt;<i> the server anymore (same situation as when an attacker is doing a MITM
</I>&gt;<i> attack) which i think is not a good situation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My proposal for both server certificates is the following:
</I>&gt;<i> An endpoint stores the public key of the servers certificate as well as
</I>&gt;<i> the host name. As long as this host continues to use the same identity
</I>&gt;<i> (pub+privkey), it will be trusted. Certificates that aren't refreshed
</I>&gt;<i> will error to the client, having another pubkey presented will error
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;harder&quot; (as in: this is a possible MITM attack)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The same behaviour could be used for client certificates as well,
</I>&gt;<i> allowing the renewal of client certificates with the same private key
</I>&gt;<i> (which would solve the &quot;how do i have persistent identities&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you guys think?
</I>
  I think that's reasonable, as the client certificate for gemini.conman.org
is set to expire in a few days (I run my own CA as an experiment).
