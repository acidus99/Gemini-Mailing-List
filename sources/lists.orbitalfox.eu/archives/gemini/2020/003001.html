<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Solderpunk once stated:
&gt;<i> It's true that frequent use of &quot;the back button&quot; or similar
</I>&gt;<i> navigational strategies to get around Geminispace means that certain
</I>&gt;<i> individual pages may be loaded several times within a browsing session
</I>&gt;<i> (one might go back and forth between a page listing entries in a gemlog
</I>&gt;<i> and those individual entries), and that can be a little wasteful.
</I>&gt;<i> Smarter navigation tools (like AV-98's &quot;tours&quot;) can reduce this waste,
</I>&gt;<i> but it's also easily fixed by clients doing something simple like
</I>&gt;<i> keeping the 5 or 10 most recently visited pages cached in memory, with
</I>&gt;<i> cached pages expiring after 10 minutes or so (AV-98 does this, although
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think I've done a release since adding it).  Clients doing this
</I>&gt;<i> would obviously have problems with content which updated more frequently
</I>&gt;<i> than every 10 minutes, but that kind of content is - and I would argue
</I>&gt;<i> *should* be - very rare in Geminispace.  Apps are the one obvious place
</I>&gt;<i> where this strategy might fail, which is perhaps yet another argument in
</I>&gt;<i> favour of having different clients optimised for reading and for apps.
</I>
  For my gopher client, I cache files that are fetched for the session. 
They're stored to disk, and when I quit out of the gopher client, the files
are deleted.  There is an option to reload an already loaded page, but I
don't think I use that all that often.
