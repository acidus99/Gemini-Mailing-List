<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Stephane Bortzmeyer once stated:
&gt;<i> On Mon, Dec 07, 2020 at 09:46:06PM +0000,
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini">colecmac at protonmail.com</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini">colecmac at protonmail.com</A>&gt; wrote 
</I>&gt;<i>  a message of 49 lines which said:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Despite what this RFC says, I don't see what situation would actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; completely fail on punycoded domains. I guess the spec could mandate trying
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with punycode first, than Unicode, but that seems needless to me. Do you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have an example of a system/network that fails on punycode?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> mDNS (used in Apple's Bonjour). Despite its name, it has little to do
</I>&gt;<i> with DNS, and it requires UTF-8 (and does not use Punycode).
</I>
  I was curious about this, having written a DNS library [1].  Saying it has
nothing to do with DNS while being called &quot;Multicast DNS&quot;, using the same
encoding scheme as DNS, and covers a portion of the DNS namespace, saying it
has &quot;little to do with DNS&quot; is a bit uncharitable (in my opinion).  It *is*
DNS, over UDP---it just uses a special IP address and different port.

  I was also surprised that UTF-8 characters *are* possible in DNS packets
[2].  I was, however, a bit disappointed that &quot;g&#233;meaux.bortzmeyer.org&quot; and
&quot;xn--gmeaux-bva.bortzmeyer.org&quot; didn't exist.

[2]	And I was happy to see my library could successfully deal with such,
	even as I wasn't conseciously aware of doing so.
