However they like!  But &quot;verbatim&quot; seems like the only sensible option.

I really don't follow you here.  Writers are of course *allowed* to put
asterisks around their words if they want to but this doesn't imply that
they should expect clients to do anything in particular with that
information.  People use asterisks to emphasise words when writing
plain text content for Gopher where they know for sure that clients
won't do anything with it.

&gt;<i> So clients will render the above as &quot;sshle&quot;, which isn't the writer's
</I>&gt;<i> intent.
</I>
What on Earth makes you think clients will render that as sshle?  I
wouldn't use a client that did that.
