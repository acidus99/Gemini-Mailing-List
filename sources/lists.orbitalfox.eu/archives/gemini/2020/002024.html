<PRE>Hello!

I discovered Gemini a little over a month ago, and like many others, decided to
write my own client. It's been a fun project, and it's now been a few weeks since
it reached the point where I'm spending more time browsing Gemini capsules
than writing it. Thus, I figured I should share it in case others found it useful.

Notable features include a vim-inspired interface, a focus on features of
convenience for browsing such as search within a page, and cross-platform
support, including making it relatively easy for non-developers to run it
through releasing binaries.

I invite you to visit its home page at
<A HREF="https://ajtjp.com/software/titan/titan.html">https://ajtjp.com/software/titan/titan.html</A> and give it a try. For now, I've
left its home page on the WWW, so that users without a Gemini browser can
discover and download it more easily. I've set up a couple mailing lists on
SourceHut (linked from its home page), so if you are interested in following
Titan, you can subscribe there, as I don't want to spam this thread.

I've also recently set up a Gemini capsule at <A HREF="gemini://ajtjp.com,">gemini://ajtjp.com,</A> running
Gemserv. There isn't much content there yet, compared to my Gopher or HTTPS
sites, but I will likely be adding more in the future.

- Andrew J

P.S. It's been pretty cool reading various Gemlogs over the past month. I
should probably reach out in response occasionally; there are several capsules
where I've seen enough updates to start recognizing them. Doubly so when I've
realized I've also browsed their Gopher hole in the past!
