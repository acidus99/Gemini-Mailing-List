 marc &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini">marcx2 at welz.org.za</A>&gt; wrote 
 a message of 45 lines which said:

&gt;<i> An URL is an address, in the same way that a phone number or an IP
</I>&gt;<i> is an address. Ideally these are globally unique, unambiguous and
</I>&gt;<i> representable everywhere.  This address scheme should be independent
</I>&gt;<i> of a localisation.
</I>
This theory, in the world of domain names, is wrong. RFC 2277 says
that &quot;protocol elements&quot; (basically, the things the user does not see
such as the MIME type text/gemini) do not have to be
internationalized. Everything else (&quot;text&quot;, says the RFC) must be
internationalized, simply because the world is like that, with
multiple scripts and languages. Now, identifiers, like domain names,
are a complicated case, since they are both protocol elements and
text. But, since they are widely visible (in advertisments, business
cards, etc), I believe they should be internationalized, too.

&gt;<i> Using unicode in addresses balkanises this global space
</I>
The english-speaking space is not a global space: it is the space of a
minority of the world population.

&gt;<i> subtle ambiguities (is the cyrilic C the same as a latin - C, who
</I>&gt;<i> knows ?),
</I>
There is no ambiguity, U+0421 is different from  U+0043.

&gt;<i> reducing security,
</I>
That's false. I stil wait to see an actual phishing email with
Unicode. Most of the time, the phisher does not even bother to have a
realistic URL, they advertise &lt;<A HREF="http://evil.example/famousbank">http://evil.example/famousbank</A>&gt; and it
works (few people check URL).

Anyway, the goal of Gemini is not to do onli banking so this is not
really an issue.

&gt;<i> If somebody points me at an url in kanji or ethiopian, I would have
</I>&gt;<i> great difficulty remembering nevermind recreating it,
</I>
It is safe to assume that a URL in ethiopian is for people who speak
the relevant language so it is not a problem. 

&gt;<i> without a common denominator this is an N^2 problem.
</I>
There is no common denominator (unless someone decided that everybody
must use english but I don't remember such decision).

&gt;<i> but interacting with the internet requires
</I>&gt;<i> a jargon or specialisation anyway, in the same way that botanists
</I>&gt;<i> invoke latin names, mathematicians write about eigenvectors
</I>&gt;<i> and brain surgeons talk about the hippocampus, all regardless
</I>&gt;<i> of which languages they speak at home.
</I>
OK, then let's all use Hangul for URL. (It's a nice script, very
regular, so it is convenient for computer programs.)
