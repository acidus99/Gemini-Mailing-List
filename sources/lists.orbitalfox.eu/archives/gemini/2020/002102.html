<PRE>A proposal: &quot;TOFU-TOTS&quot;.  You know, like tater tots, but without
potatoes in them.  Or rather, trust-on-first-use augmented by
trust-over-time-and-space.

Desiderata:

* Limit actions of blind faith to a single point in time.
* Allow ever more trust to slowly, organically build up after that
  point.
* Permit fully automated regular key rotation on servers.
* Don't require client authors to write code to validate signatures.

Assumptions:

* MITM attacks limited to a single network for a short duration of time
  are a plausible threat, but MITM attacks which target an individual
  user no matter which network their using are extremely hard, and even
  on a single network (home ISP, say), MITM attacks which last for
  months or years require dedication and are more likely to be
  whistleblown.

Quick description:

* Certs last for several years
* The very first time you connect to a server (or the first time after
  so long that all your previous knowledge about that server is badly
  out of date), blindly accept whatever you get.
* New keys and certs are generated 1 year before they become valid
  (consecutive certs have maybe 1 month of overlapping validity to allow
  for change over)
* New certs, or their fingerprint, are served on a well-known end point
  immediately after generation, i.e. for roughly one year before their
  validity begins.
* TOFU-TOTS clients have a &quot;trust maintenance&quot; procedure which should be
  run, say, once a month, or maybe every 3 months.  Fancy clients can do
  this automatically in the background on a separate thread.  Simple
  clients can just keep track of when this was last run, check that
  against the current date on startup and say &quot;Hey, you haven't done
  trust maintenance in a while, wanna do it now?  Y/N&quot; without bothering
  with threads.  Users who are security nerds should be able to run it
  on demand whenever they like.
* Trust maintenance involves:
    - Removing expired certificates from the TOFU database
    - If a non-expired cert in the DB has less than 1 year of validity
      left, hit the server's well known endpoint and, assuming that
      transaction takes place using a previously trusted cert, store the
      cert/fingerprint you see at that endpoint, along with a counter of
      how many times you've observed it.
    - If the same well known endpoint ever serves up different future
      certificates while the same current certificate is valid, &quot;warn
      hard&quot;.
* When a new cert comes down the line, &quot;warn hard&quot; if it's completely
  out of the blue.  Accept it silently if it's been pre-advertised by
  the appropriate server at least N times previously (perhaps &quot;warn
  softly&quot; if it's been advertised less than N times but at least once),
  and delete that server's previously trusted cert (possibly
  incrementing a counter of the number of trusted roll-overs this server
  has achieved, permitting the option to &quot;warn extremely hard&quot; if we
  ever get an out of the blue cert change for a server which has
  previously done the right thing multiple times).

Properties:

* Meets all desiderata above.
* If I steal your private key, I can straightforwardly use this in
  attacks only until your current cert expires - not forever, as
  would be the case with 100 year certs.
* In order to extend the time I can exploit the stolen key, I need to
  successfully MITM every possible future victim of my attacks, for
  multiple executions of their trust maintenance routine, which happen
  at unpredictable times, over the course of a year, possibly from
  multiple different networks, and I can't do this if I steal your key
  in its final year of validity, because victims will have already
  picked up the true next certificate at least once - this is a big
  improvement over roll-over schemes where new certificates are signed
  with the private key of the old certificate, in which case once I've
  stolen your key it's trivial for me to just sign myself future
  certificates which anybody will accept - and I can keep doing this,
  forever, spinning a single key breach out indefinitely despite
  regular rotation!
* Clients are, as always, vulnerable to undetected MITM attacks on that
  very first connection, but such an attack can be fairly easily
  discovered after the fact (providing a strong disincentive for e.g.
  commercial ISPs to do them regularly) unless the attacker commits to a
  clean exit by MITMing you multiple times in the future to feed you the
  legitimate next cert.

Right now, I think this provides pretty good robustness against MITM
attacks relative to how conceptually complicated it is - nothing is
involved on the server side except generating stand-alone self-signed
certs and copying them at the right time into the document root, which
is very easily automated, and nothing is involved on the client side
except storing hashes of entire certs in a DB and checking expiry dates.
Client authors never have to write their own signature validation code,
so this can be done even with TLS libraries that don't make that easy.
It also has the advantage of keeping TLS network overhead as low as
possible by having servers only ever send a single cert.

But, maybe I've overlooked something.  Feedback welcome.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
