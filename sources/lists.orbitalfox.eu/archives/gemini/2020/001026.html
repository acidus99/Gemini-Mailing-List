<PRE>Definitely no worries. I am a little bummed that I did not get this cleared up before a major
 release I just did. I just went through multi-hour (it needs to get improved) cross-compilation 
and website updates and do not relish doing so again this weekend. So this may sit for a short
bit, but will get updated in the not distant future for Bombadillo. I have added the issue on
the tildegit[1] and will try to get to it this week.

I definitely agree that escaping should occur, but since my client was originally built as a
gopher client I was not escaping there... and just never updated anything in that regard
when gemini got added. The Go net/url module's QueryEscape[2] uses '+' for space rather 
than '%20'.  So it seems that is why I was running into thinking people were not supporting 
escaping. What is the advice here? It seems that python does not, by default, escape a '+'
as a space and a number of servers are using Python. Further, it seems that '+' can be,
optionally, supported as representing a space... this seems like it can/will lead to problems.

My guess is that Molly Brown will support it fine, but that JetForce and many others may
not.
