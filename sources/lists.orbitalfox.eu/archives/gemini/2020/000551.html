<PRE>Hi Dave,

This is a good point to raise.  I guess prior to the recent influx of
interest from Hacker News and other places, we've been able to somewhat
ignore this, because most of the consumers of Gemini content have also
been active community members who have the skills, interest and time to
get their client(s) of choice up and running.  But lowering the barrier
to entry will be important for wider adoption.

I can't promise anything, but I'll make an effort to push out a 1.0.0
release of AV-98 tomorrow (cue anguished cries from people in
Gopherspace who have been waiting years for a 1.0.0 release of VF-1!),
and as part of that I'll upload it to PyPI - that means a simple `pip
install` will be able to get people started.  Admittedly a command-line
client isn't going to be an easy intro for a lot of people, but it will
work for many, and to be honest I'm not sure the project is necessarily
ready for thousands of new users in a short time span yet.  But some
extra energy - and especially content! - would definitely be very
welcome.

Cheers,
Solderpunk

You can find it here: <A HREF="gemini://vi.rs">gemini://vi.rs</A>  I'm using Let's Encrypt TLS certs with a modified Pollux. I've been watching the Gemini project for months now and I like where it is headed. I chose to publish using only Gemini because it is the closest user-sovereign publishing system we have ATM.

</I>&gt;<i> The only problem now is that lots of people have asked me what they can download and run to read my Gemini &quot;mission log&quot;. There aren't any precompiled packages or installers so I've been having them ssh to kiosk to run the VP client. Is anybody planning to publish packages/installers anytime soon? I've had several thousand hits on my Gemini space in the last couple of days despite the hurdles for getting onto Gemini. Castor is hosted on sr.ht that has CI capabilities. I'm familiar with setting up CI builds on Github but not on sr.ht. Does anybody know how to set that up and is willing to send a patch to the maintainer of Castor?
