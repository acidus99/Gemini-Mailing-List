Yes you're right there are different reference systems, so coordinates 
will vary accordingly. What I couldn't get from those links is anything 
to resolve the naming question or whether a constellation could be both 
in quadrants named both &quot;NQ2&quot; and &quot;NGQ3&quot; in different schemes.

In 50 years time the historians will wonder why there was a fundamental 
naming quirk within the hypertext system that replaced the web. No one 
will know about the wikipedia pages and the naming convention will 
become re-mythologised to take on other cultural symbolism.

Or maybe not.
