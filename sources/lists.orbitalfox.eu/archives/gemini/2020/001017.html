This is precisely what excites me about SCGI.  Until Go gets non-broken
from the perspective of traditional unix user-based permissions, there's
no way for Molly Brown to securely kick off a CGI process via fork().
If something else (a helper program, or the admin) starts the process,
they can presumably start it as a `nobody` user and chroot it somewhere
safe.  It's clunky, but I can live with it for now.

</I>
We really need to get the adaptation of RFC-3875 documented somewhere.
Not in the Gemini-spec, but in some kind of side-spec thing, with it's
own name or ID and file in gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/, or a sub
directory thereof.  Not just CGI, but our proposed adaptation of robots.txt,
and other stuff like that.  I dunno what these should be called, I'm not
sure how they should be managed.  I might end up delegating most
responsibility for these &quot;side specs&quot; to interested people who I trust
to do a good job.  I have a bunch of ill-formed ideas for side specs
that it would be good to bring to life.
 
&gt;<i>   I was going to make SCGI support a handler (like all of my dynamic content

</I>&gt;<i> thus leaves users out [1].  I then had an inspired thought (or evil, take

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> lrwxrwxrwx  1 spc spc 16 May 24 00:03 foo -&gt; <A HREF="scgi:////tmp/log">scgi:////tmp/log</A>
</I>&gt;<i> lrwxrwxrwx  1 spc spc 22 May 23 23:57 here -&gt; <A HREF="scgi://localhost:33333">scgi://localhost:33333</A>
</I>&gt;<i> lrwxrwxrwx  1 spc spc 22 May 23 23:58 there -&gt; <A HREF="scgi://[fc00::1">scgi://[fc00::1</A>]:3333/
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   The first points to a Unix domain socket, the other two to TCP sockets. 
</I>&gt;<i> This will give users a way to use SCGI without having access to the config
</I>&gt;<i> files for the Gemini server.  I'm not saying everybody has to use this
</I>&gt;<i> symbolic hack for SCGI---it's just that I'm using this hack for SCGI support
</I>&gt;<i> in GLV-1.12556.  
</I>
Nice hack!
