<PRE>Greetings Geminauts!

Hot on the heels of Gemfeed, I'm happy to announce that a rough first
implementation now exists of my long-planned Gemini feed aggregator,
CAPCOM:

<A HREF="https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/CAPCOM">https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/CAPCOM</A>

It's probably not yet ready for people to experiment with setting up
their own personal CAPCOMs (ala moku-pona), but I'm announcing it
already to draw attention to the fact that I now have an experimental
version of the public CAPCOM instance up at:

<A HREF="gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/capcom/">gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/capcom/</A>

It is aggregating jmcbray's &quot;Send the Nukes&quot; feed, and the feed for my
own &quot;Hi-ten Heroes&quot; cycling gemlog, because these are the only feeds I
know of!  Only you can help to change that...

At least in these very early days of Geminispace, I don't intend to
&quot;curate&quot; the public CAPCOM, it will basically be the &quot;firehose&quot; for
all of Geminispace.  I hope this will make it an awful lot easier for
the small community to keep tabs on itself, compared to manually
checking a whole lot of infrequently updated addresses every day.  I
also hope that it will remove the fear that some people may have been
having that there's no point spending time producing content for
Gemini because nobody will find or read it.  Now that we have
something like Bongusta, there is no reason an active gemlogosphere
can't bootstrap itself.

As already stated, if you are using the sftp-based free Geminispace I
offer at gemini.circumlunar.space, you can email me to get an Atom
feed generated for any of your directories via a cron job.  If you are
hosting content at your own server (or any server where you can setup
cron jobs or run commands from ssh), you can test out Gemfeed 1.0.0 to
generate your own feed!  If you get it working, just email me (or the
list) your feed URL and I will add it to CAPCOM.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
</PRE>
