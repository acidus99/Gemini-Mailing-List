<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Sandra Snan once stated:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While I'm on the topic of one link per line, the whole numbers in the
</I>&gt;<i> paragraphs to refer to line links style is not cool. Its as if you want
</I>&gt;<i> inline links. If you wanted inline links then why didn't you put them in
</I>&gt;<i> the spec?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> The spec was designed by someone who wanted text paragraphs followed by
</I>&gt;<i> (or preceded by) lists of links. _Pages_ are hypertext, but the prose
</I>&gt;<i> isn't.
</I>
  Because it was clear that people *wanted* links in gopher?  Because there
are too many variations on Markdown already?  Because it's not that easy to
parse Markdown? [1]  Solderpunk wanted a way to include links and still make
it easy to parse.

  I do the numbering thing because I'm converting HTML to gemtext, and I
borrowed most of the code from my work in converting HTML to text for
gopher.  I like HTML for its hypertext capabilities.  But I found that it
was harder for me to convert HTML to gemtext tnan to plain text since
gemtext has *just* enough capabilities to make it seem easier, but not
enough to handle some of the seldom used tags (like &lt;DL&gt;&lt;DT&gt;&lt;DD&gt;) or even
simple nesting (a &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt; within a &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;).

  I could serve HTML, but that would go against the grain of Gemini.

  So I'm looking at this post of mine:

        <A HREF="http://boston.conman.org/2020/07/28.1">http://boston.conman.org/2020/07/28.1</A>

and I'm wondering how I would do it differently.  I supposed instead of
(showing the rendered output, not the actual gemtext):

        On Saturday, I sent a message [1] to the party responsible for
        slamming my Gemini server [2] (one among several) and I've yet to
        receive any response.  I removed the block from the firewall, and I
        haven't seen any requests from said bot.  It looks to have been a
        one-off thing at this time.

        [1] /boston/2020/07/25.2
        [2] /boston/2020/07/24.2

        Weird.

        But then again, this is the Intarwebs, where weird things [1] happen
        all the time [2].

        [1] /boston/2006/10/30.1
        [2] /boston/2015/04/29.1

        At this point, I'm hoping it was fixed silently and it won't be an
        issue again.

        issue again.

  I'm not sure how I fell about that.  It doesn't look as good to me as the
numbered links.  Would you prefer I just serve up text/html?  Not use HTML
at all?  Change the output to the sample above?

  And before I go, here are the links to all three versions (HTML, plain
text, gemtext):

	<A HREF="http://boston.conman.org/2020/07/28.1">http://boston.conman.org/2020/07/28.1</A>
	<A HREF="gopher://gopher.conman.org/0Phlog:2020/07/28.1">gopher://gopher.conman.org/0Phlog:2020/07/28.1</A>
	<A HREF="gemini://gemini.conman.org/boston/2020/07/28.1">gemini://gemini.conman.org/boston/2020/07/28.1</A>

  -spc

[1]	Markdown, as initially defined by John Gruber also allowed arbitrary
	HTML.  I think most people either forget that detail, or don't know
	about it in the first place.
