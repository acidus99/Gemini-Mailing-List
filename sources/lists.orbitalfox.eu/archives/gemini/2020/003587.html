Wow this thread blew up overnight. Anyway, I was the one that first posted about Field v. Google as one example case about litigation related to search engines and copyright. In an effort to avoid more &quot;someone is wrong on the internet&quot; arguments, here's the crux:

- If you as a copyright holder want to deny your content being cached and served by a 3rd party (for instance a search engine) you have a well known mechanism to do so in robots.txt.

- If your content is archived or cached against your desires your means of remediation are legal ones. Taking the issue to court will result in a court deciding if you are within your rights to protect your content or if the searcher/archiver/indexer is under fair use.

- The rules around copyright and media protections are established in each country, but are nearly universally applied worldwide via the Berne Convention and/or agreements like the Electronic Commerce Directive. 

- Existing legal precedent suggests you can expect a ruling in favor of implied consent if you do not have a robots.txt. 

All of this is to suggest we save ourselves the trouble down the road and just use robots.txt as-is.


Finally, and completely unrelated to everything: it was Oracle who tried to claim their APIs via patent rather than the other way around. See:
