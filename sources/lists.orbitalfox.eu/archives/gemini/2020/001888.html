<PRE>Even with a simple protocol, clients will need to make decisions around
handling things gracefully to give users a good experience. The network
is fundamentally unreliable, after all!

Maybe in these early days client authors can help the community by
exposing debug logs. Kind of like when you open dev tools in a browser
and you can see warnings for protocol violations or errors.

</I>&gt;<i> As implementers tho, I wonder if we shouldn't be working around problems like this (assuming it's on the other side). Should we be strict with out of spec implementations? I feel that the attitude of trying to parse bad html and weird headers is partially what led to the mess in the web early on... But if some clients start working around that stuff, then ones that don't will be considered broken.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I may have had a related issue, I remember having trouble with redirects

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; were closing *right after* sending the redirect, I think, and I wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; capturing the last few bytes. But I was using Go, not Flutter, so I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; sure how much this helps.
