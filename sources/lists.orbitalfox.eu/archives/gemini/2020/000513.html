<PRE>Greetings all!

I too have been working on getting some aggregation tools together for gemini.
I have written this: <A HREF="https://tildegit.org/sloum/spacewalk">https://tildegit.org/sloum/spacewalk</A>

It generates update listings similarly to moku-pona. It is written in golang and
takes advantage of concurrency when checking for updates to pages and should
run pretty fast. It also allows for individual users to manage multiple aggregation
feeds/pages and is ideal on a multiuser system (though users will still need access
to cron to be able to have things automatically run on a schedule).

If you get it installed and running please let me know how it works out for you as
I have not had opportunity to use it in conjunction with an actual gemini server
as of yet (just a lot of local testing).

I know there is also still the problem of content on gemini that does not involve
talking about gemini itself. To that end I have put up some content on my
circumlunar geminispace:

<A HREF="gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space:1965/~sloum/">gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space:1965/~sloum/</A>

I was a musician in a previous life and have a large catalog of various types of
music. I thought maybe it could have a second life on gemini, or a first life in the
case of a few things I plan to eventually post. My plan is to put up another album
every week or two. The first one is a drone/ambient album. Hopefully someone
will enjoy some of it (there is a bunch of different stuff, so definitely come back
again even if the first one isnt to your taste).

Credit where credit is due:

The idea to put up music was very much inspired by Cat's excellent gemini capsule
KONPeITO (<A HREF="gemini://konpeito.media">gemini://konpeito.media</A>), which posts really really awesome mixes.


I hope the plaguetimes are treating everyone alright and that you are all staying
safe/healthy!
</PRE>
