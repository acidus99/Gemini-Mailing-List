well, teeeechnically it'd have to do this for all text/* files, according to the rfc, including
plaintext and whatnot... although THAT's unlikely to happen...

I'd also be in favor of server handling it, although that is a kinda-valid point...
html doesn't count because the browsers will do their best to fix all kinds of TOTALLY BROKEN html,
you can have partial tags, no end tags for some, etc, and the browser will never tell the user your
site is a trashpile, it will just silently try its best to fix it up (even in inspect element,
you'd see the &quot;repaired&quot; version)...
