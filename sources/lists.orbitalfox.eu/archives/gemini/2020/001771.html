General purpose, application-optimised clients.  Application specific
clients would be nothing to get excited about.  To quote my post:

&gt;<i> Yes, you can build tiny little remote command line apps which use HTTP

</I>
I have an in-development proof-of-concept implementation of this here:

<A HREF="https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/alphonse">https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/alphonse</A>

It is basically AV-98 with half the code ripped out (and more ripping to
be done!).  It requires a URL, TLS cert and TLS key as compulsory
command line options.  The cert is used unconditionally for all
requests, and it will refuse to visit any URL which is not at the same
domain and the same path or lower as the provided starting URL.  The
&quot;go&quot; command, all bookmarking stuff, &quot;tour&quot; command and any other
interface elements that allow the user to specify somewhere to go have
been removed.  You just use the internal links of the apps you point it
at upon startup and can't go anywhere else.

I have aliased `astrobotany` in my shell to fire up Alphonse, pointed at
astrobotany.mozz.us/app and feeding in my existing cert/key, and it's
now how I water my plant.  As intended, it basically gives the remote
Gemini app the appearance of a local command line application.  Now I
can use any Gemini client I like for my day to day reading of gemlogs,
without it needing to support client certificates or, if it does support
them, without me having told it where to find my astrobotany certs, and
thus my little space plant is now totally invulnerable to CSRF attacks.

This is not only a safer way to use astrobotany, it is much more
convenient than opening a general purpose client, opening my bookmarks,
choosing astrobotany, selecting my cert from a list that is brought up
when it sees the 6x status code, and then playing.  I just open a new
terminal, type `astro`, hit tab, hit enter and then I'm in,
authenticated, ready to go.  I can't imagine wanting to go back to the
old way.  If more applications built around long-lived certificates
appear in Geminispace, I will add new aliases for the ones that
interest me.  It's a really great approach, IMHO.

It is not foolproof - it cannot protect against application-internal
CSRF attacks, e.g. some kind of multi-user application where one user
can post text/gemini content which is rendered by another user of the
same application.  But for single-user applications or applications
where different users cannot interact with one another via means of
unfiltered text/gemini, this is great.  App developers do not need to
bother with tedious nonce code, and users can click on any link they
like in their everyday client knowing the apps they use via their
app-specific client are totally safe.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
