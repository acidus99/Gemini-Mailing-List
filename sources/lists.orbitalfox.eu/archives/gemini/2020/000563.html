  One misbehaving client on an IP address can present a headache by repeated
making requests and (especially if it's behind a larger pipe than yours)
sawmp the server.  By recording the IP address, it can be identified and
blocked.

  Or a mishevaving client always makes the same request to a non-existant
resource.  I had this happen on my gopher server---some web bot kept trying
to fetch the main index.html page.  Very annoying.  Again, easy to block if
you have the IP.

  -spc (Oooh, that reminds me, I have a bug to patch in GLV-1.12556 ... )
