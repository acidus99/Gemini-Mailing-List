<PRE>Solderpunk wrote recently regarding use of color in gemini
documents. 

I would like to put in a vote to the contrary. I know that not
all clients will support color, those that do not may not be
coded to remove any methodology of adding color (current
methods surround vt100/ansi escape sequences). Many
clients will also not be terminal based, making escape
sequences nearly meaningless. Having said all this, my two
cents are that the spec should not address this whatsoever.
It should be on content creators to decide whether adding
said escape sequences is something that are comfortable 
with. Likewise, each client should choose whether this is
a detail they want to handle or not. At present my client
supports color for all protocols that it supports (gopher,
gemini, finger, local files). When color mode is toggled on
any escape sequences in the \033[???m series will be
rendered (but no other escape sequences). It feels weird
to _remove_ gemini from this feature. It feels like it should
not be a part of the spec, just like it is not part of the
gopher spec, and some clients support it and some dont:
content creators beware.


I am running into similar worries with the wrapping and
reflowing conversation. I do not want to add horizontal
scrolling to my client so hard wrapping will be done at
screen width. Reflowing is another matter of course....
I'm starting to feel like it just isnt worth the fuss. Since
_all_ clients seem to hard wrap, just use a long line if you
want flowed content. Done. No extra work required for
clients. It keeps things very very simple. At present gemini
is great to navigate around (what there is of it anyway)
and fulfills the goal of being like gopher, but better. 

Just my two cents...
