<PRE>Le lundi 7 d&#233;cembre 2020, 19:00:02 CET <A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini">colecmac at protonmail.com</A> a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> C&#244;me's reply here asserts that a client would never need to parse
</I>&gt;<i> IRIs, and so there's no added complexity. Just copy the IRI from the
</I>&gt;<i> link line, do DNS, and send the IRI to the server. But this is not
</I>&gt;<i> true, a client would need to do parsing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What parsing would a client have to do?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Extracting the domain, so it can be punycoded for DNS lookups
</I>
True, thanks for pointing that out.

&gt;<i> - Resolving relative IRIs would require parsing the current IRI,
</I>&gt;<i>    and the provided one, and combining them. You cannot just copy it
</I>&gt;<i>    to make the request.
</I>
Also true, but it should be the same value that is extracted for DNS.

&gt;<i> - When receiving an input status code on a page that already has a
</I>&gt;<i>    query string, the IRI has to be parsed to detect that there is a
</I>&gt;<i>    query string, and then remove and replace it with the new input of
</I>&gt;<i>    the user.
</I>
Good to know, I did not think of query string situation.

&gt;<i> - Extracting the path to get a name for downloading files
</I>&gt;<i> - Etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are many reasons why a client would need to be able to parse an
</I>&gt;<i> IRI, the relative link one and DNS one being the most important.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would then require IRI parsing libraries, and as I have explained
</I>&gt;<i> earlier, these don't exist in likely many programming languages, and
</I>&gt;<i> when they do, they are third-party.
</I>
From what you said on irc, the situation is different between URI and IRI because most languages have URI parsing either in their stdlib or in a well tested known library.
But, if no project use IRI, of course no one will write a library for it, this is a chicken and egg situation here.

Also, for the purpose of a client, it seems to me the parsing needed (domain and query extraction) is only to search for the first &quot;/&quot; and the last &quot;?&quot;, and some minor tweaks on the scheme maybe (which does not contain unicode, I will leave the scheme alone, promise).

Note: Just tried <A HREF="gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/%64%6f%63%73/%66%61%71%2e%67%6d%69">gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/%64%6f%63%73/%66%61%71%2e%67%6d%69</A> in lagrange, it does work.
