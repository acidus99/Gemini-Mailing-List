I feel like what's been revealed here is that you have little control of 
this the way it's designed. You could eschew URIs for your own format, but 
then it would be just harder than it is now to use off-the-shelf tools to 
&quot;pervert&quot; gemini, but still possible. It could also be that people fork 
into another protocol. In the end, the browser can be handed something by 
a server, and if the browser and server are both consenting programs, 
they'll do what they want. And if enough people think it's cool, there 
will be more of those servers, more of that content, and then more of 
those browsers. This is what happened to <A HREF="http://,">http://,</A> isn't it? How Netscape 
defeated Mosaic?


Some of the excitement around gemini feels like it's because it's a 
rebooting of http. I definitely feel it some myself. I like the aesthetic, 
though, and the idea behind it. The reality is, too, that if people extend 
gemini into another http, it will just be not-as-good http.

But can you stop people from super-setting gemini?

PS reading all this gemini stuff makes me want to create a &quot;<A HREF="wiki://">wiki://</A>&quot; 
scheme, like native super-wiki web
