<PRE>Howdy gang,

Don't think I've posted to this list since I got involved when it became
apparent that with the way discussions were going text/gemini was officially
going to be hardwrapped if someone didn't step in to support the one or two
people arguing against it. So something like 3-4 months(??).

I've had accounts on most of the tildes with gemini servers running, and I was
apparently the first person to have a gemini.circumlunar.space account, but
I've never had a server of my own.

uNtIl NoW!

Last night after zooming with friends while blackout drunk I apparently
purchased the domain name `commie.space`, and also spun up a debian VPS, so I
woke up today to a fully-DNS-propagated server. I also see that molly-brown
was installed. I've been meaning to do something like this, so I can only
assume it was supposed to be for gemini. Many thanks to the gemini community
and smirnoff for the $20/month recurring draw from my bank account.

That being said, now that the trigger's been pulled, I plan to keep this thing
up, so this morning I actually set molly brown up and quickly drafted up a
couple blog (flight log? capsule? glog?) posts, one of which explains what the
hell I even plan to put there. At the moment, the idea mostly revolves around
wild stories about working retail during the coronavirus pandemic. Maybe I'll
write hot takes about the current DiScOuRsE on left twitter every once in a
while too. And what would a gemini server be without the stereotypical meta
content about gemini?

I know it's not some wonderful, novel, interesting use for the protocol, but I
figure if I say something here, it might end up in the gemini.circumlunar.space
server list, and if that happens, it will probably get indexed by gus, so it
will actually be in gemini space. And if that happens, it'll probably force me
to actually keep up posting to it.

Anyway, that's the deal, I guess there's nothing more to say.

Thanks a lot,
lel
