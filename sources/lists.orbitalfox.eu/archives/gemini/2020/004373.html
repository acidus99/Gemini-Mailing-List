As someone who grew up actually rotating a dial to enter 7, 10, or (for
international calls) 15 digits, and looking them up in a paper booklet when
I hadn't memorized them, the user experience *sucked*.  Rectangular dials
are quicker, but otherwise not that much easier to use.  You could get a
name-to-number mapping by voice if you had enough details (typically a
postal address), but that is increasingly useless except for reaching a
business.  So what we have now is a system where numbers are universal and
the associated names are purely local.

The insinuation was that internationalised URLs are essential
&gt;<i> because people who don't speak english at all might not be
</I>&gt;<i> able to comprehend or (if their input system is sufficiently
</I>&gt;<i> different) generate ascii/latin text.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think that is not the point at all.  In general, anglophones don't want
URLs that are completely meaningless: domain names generally have meaning
and so do path names and file names (consider <A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A>
gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/companion/robots.gmi, for example, which
tells you a lot about the document it identifies).  But if they are in the
wrong script, &#1076;&#1077;&#1081; &#1072;&#1088; &#1085;&#1086;&#1090; &#1072;&#1090; &#1086;&#1083; &#1080;&#1079;&#1080; &#1090;&#1091; &#1072;&#1085;&#1076;&#1077;&#1088;&#1089;&#1090;&#1072;&#1085;&#1076; &#1086;&#1088; &#1080;&#1074;&#1077;&#1085; &#1090;&#1091; &#1088;&#1077;&#1082;&#1086;&#1075;&#1085;&#1072;&#1081;&#1079;.  In

&gt;<i> The desire to be inclusive is good, but we are deferential

</I>

Nid yw pob gwlad yn defnyddio un iaith yn unig.  (Not all countries use
only one language).


&gt;<i> In this regard having people know learn a new language to interact
</I>&gt;<i> with the internet isn't that much of an imposition, but a return
</I>&gt;<i> to the way things were... just scaled up to the size of the planet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In imperio Romanorum, facilis est negotiator Romanus quam Gallus sive
Germanus, because the Roman grew up knowing the language of trade.
Likewise the anglophone today.

Isn't that yet another hint ? That the point of a language is to
&gt;<i> communicate, not to serve as a barrier, despite the machinations
</I>&gt;<i> of nationalists ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
'M&#225;lin eru h&#246;fu&#240;einkenni &#254;j&#243;&#240;anna' &#8212; Languages are the chief distinguishing
&gt;<i> marks of peoples. No people in fact comes into being until it speaks a
</I>&gt;<i> language of its own; let the languages perish and the peoples perish too,
</I>&gt;<i> or become different peoples. But that never happens except as the result of
</I>&gt;<i> oppression and distress.'
</I>&gt;<i> These are the words of a little-known Icelander of the early nineteenth
</I>&gt;<i> century, Sj&#233;ra Tomas S&#230;mundsson, He had, of course, primarily in mind the
</I>&gt;<i> part played by the cultivated Icelandic language, in spite of poverty, lack
</I>&gt;<i> of power, and insignificant numbers, in keeping the Icelanders in being in
</I>&gt;<i> desperate times. But the words might as well apply to the Welsh of Wales,
</I>&gt;<i> who have also loved and cultivated their language for its own sake (not as
</I>&gt;<i> an aspirant for the ruinous honour of becoming the lingua franca of the
</I>&gt;<i> world), and who by it and with it maintain their identity.
</I>

--J.R.R. Tolkien, who was the furthest thing possible from either a
nationalist or an imperialist.  This is less true in Wales than it was when
Tolkien wrote it, but the point is the same.
