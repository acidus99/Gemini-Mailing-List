<PRE>&gt;<i> Flounder looks awesome, nice work. It's a beautiful website, and
</I>&gt;<i> looks great on Gemini too. To my knowledge this is the first time
</I>&gt;<i> gemtext has been used like this outside Gemini, like as a generic
</I>&gt;<i> format.
</I>
Thank you/! /
&gt;<i> That would be great, the first thing I tried to do was visit
</I>&gt;<i> flounder.online in my Gemini browser but it didn't work of course.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise it's a bit confusing.
</I>
Based on my research, it looks like the most mature tool for this is Molly Brown with CGI --
getting it working might be a weekend project for me.

&gt;<i> Could you explain more? I don't know Rust but I'd be happy to
</I>&gt;<i> help idea-wise.
</I>
Basically the issue is -- a common use case would be for someone to want to link another flounder page from their page, for example I might link
my friend juliet.flounder.online's page from alex.flounder.online. A user who is using Flounder through a web app may use the link <A HREF="https://juliet.flounder.online">https://juliet.flounder.online</A>
which isn't ideal when accessing it through gemini, since the link brings them out of Gemini. I think the solution is to instruct users to use
<A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> links for other Flounder pages (and maybe put something in the UI that encourages this) and then convert <A HREF="gemini://x.flounder.online">gemini://x.flounder.online</A>
to <A HREF="https://x.flounder.online">https://x.flounder.online</A> when rendering it over https (right now I use the mozz.us proxy). I could also force this translation by modifying users' text when they save a file with
an <A HREF="https://x.flounder.online">https://x.flounder.online</A> link but I'm not a fan of that. Maybe I could create some sort of warning that explains this, or even better I could come up
with a way to let people use simple tags like @alex and then translate that into a gemini URL on gemini or an https url on https.

 &#160;&gt; The twtxt protocol sounds cool, and good addition to the small web.

I think there was a discussion earlier in the mailing list that inspired my idea!

&gt;<i> Finally, you should check out gemlog.blue if you haven't already, on
</I>&gt;<i> the Web and Gemini. It's a similar project, but with a slightly different
</I>&gt;<i> focus, as the posts are only available on Gemini.
</I>
This is very cool! I'll definitely have to glean some ideas from this

Alex
