Apache is designed to be able to serve large enterprises with high
request loads. The cause for their concern seems unlikely to apply to
multi-user Gemini hosts.

&gt;<i> I concede that this isn't impossible - it is potentially expensive,

</I>
It's very much a matter of implementation. For example, if high
performance is a concern you can regenerate the information once per
minute rather than on a per-request basis, or on request from the users,
via a Gemini endpoint.

That's however a good argument for an Allow directive corresponding to
Disallow, to be able to disallow by default and only allowing resources
lower down in the hierarchy explicitly, which allows for a &quot;better safe
than sorry&quot; approach to &quot;prevent&quot; a crawler from picking up resources
before the new robot rules have been picked up.

&gt;<i> So I think this is the interesting bit of the discussion -
</I>&gt;<i> the tradeoff of keeping this information inside the file or
</I>&gt;<i> in a sidechannel. You are of course correct that not every
</I>&gt;<i> file format permits embedding such information, and that
</I>&gt;<i> is the one side of the tradeoff.... the other side is
</I>&gt;<i> the argument for persistence - having the data in another
</I>&gt;<i> file (or in a protocol header) means that is likely to be
</I>&gt;<i> lost.
</I>
What you're proposing is doubly effective in that data that isn't there
*can't* be lost! :)

I appreciate your point, but &quot;not every file format&quot; is an
understatement. It's really only one file format that is controlled by
the Gemini spec right now: text/gemini. That's where we could add such
information and define it to be meaningful.

&gt;<i> And my view is that caching/archiving/aggregating/protocol
</I>&gt;<i> translation all involve making copies, where a careless or
</I>&gt;<i> inconsiderate intermediate is likely to discard information
</I>&gt;<i> not embedded in the file.
</I>
A careless or inconsiderate intermediate is likely to discard
information, full stop. It's only respectful and considerate robots
that will recognize either approach.

&gt;<i> For instance, if a web frontend
</I>&gt;<i> serves <A HREF="gemini://example.org/private.gmi">gemini://example.org/private.gmi</A> as
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://example.com/gemini/example.org/private.gmi">https://example.com/gemini/example.org/private.gmi</A>
</I>&gt;<i> how good are the odds that this frontend fetches
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="gemini://example.org/robots.txt,">gemini://example.org/robots.txt,</A> rewrites the urls in there
</I>&gt;<i> from /private.gmi to /gemini/example.org/private.gmi and
</I>&gt;<i> merges it into its own /robots.txt ? And does it before
</I>&gt;<i> any crawler request is made...
</I>
On the other hand, how likely is it that a web crawler will interpret
robot instructions from text/gemini-turned-html documents?

&gt;<i> A pragmatist's argument: The web and geminispace are a graph
</I>&gt;<i> of links, and all the interior nodes have to be markup, so those
</I>&gt;<i> are covered, and they control the reachability - without
</I>&gt;<i> a link you can't get to the terminal/leaf node. And even if
</I>&gt;<i> this is bypassed (robots.txt isn't really a defence against hotlinking
</I>&gt;<i> either) most other terminal nodes are images or video, which typically have
</I>&gt;<i> ways of adding meta information (exif, etc).
</I>
Do you propose to standardize extensions to Exif/ID3/Vorbis
comments/PDF metadata etc. as well as text/gemini? Neither these
currently have a standard way to specify a robots policy; it seems
understood that it's not a concern of the file itself whether a crawler
should be able to download it if the file is ever served over a
crawlable graph.

Hotlinking is a different concern altogether. The purpose of robots.txt
is not to disallow hotlinking.
