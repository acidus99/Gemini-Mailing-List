<PRE>Hi

&gt;<i> &gt; It's 2020, can we please be allowed to use french in our links?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And it is even more important for people who use scripts like arabic,
</I>&gt;<i> chinese, devanageri, etc.
</I>
I am to be convinced that unicode URLs are a good thing.

And I say that as a native speaker of a language which
includes glyphs which aren't in US ASCII.

An URL is an address, in the same way that a phone
number or an IP is an address. Ideally these are globally
unique, unambiguous and representable everywhere.
This address scheme should be independent of a localisation.

We don't insist that phone numbers are rendered in roman
numerals either. My dialing prefix isn't +XXVII. The
<A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> prefix isn't <A HREF="tweeling://">tweeling://</A> in dutch.

Using unicode in addresses balkanises this global space into
separate little domains, with subtle ambiguities (is the
cyrilic C the same as a latin - C, who knows ?), reducing
security, and making crossover harder. If somebody points
me at an url in kanji or ethiopian, I would have great
difficulty remembering nevermind recreating it, even if the 
photo there is useful to the rest of the world. If you 
are saying what about the guy from Ethiopia - well, I suspect he
would have trouble with kanji too... without a common
denominator this is an N^2 problem.

I appreciate that many languages are in decline and even
facing extinction - but interacting with the internet requires
a jargon or specialisation anyway, in the same way that botanists
invoke latin names, mathematicians write about eigenvectors
and brain surgeons talk about the hippocampus, all regardless
of which languages they speak at home.

TLDR: The words after the gemini =&gt; link can be unicode, the
link itself should not.

regards

marc
