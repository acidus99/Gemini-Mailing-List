That makes very little sense to me.  It's true that www.vatican.va provides
a Latin user interface, but a site presenting English law is going to have
an English interface only, even though the older laws are in Latin or Old
Norman French.  *Nobody* needs an Old Norman French user interface.

Similarly, gutenberg.org provides only an English interface, even though it
provides e-books in 55 languages, from 37527 in English and 2356 in French
down to 21 languages with a single book each.  (There are other PG-like
sites in and for many countries; see the WP article.)

I can't agree there either.  The only requirement in Gemini imposed on the
query string is that the URL sent after a 10 or 11 response contains
whatever the user entered as the query string.  There is nothing to prevent
link lines from containing query strings themselves.

In the Gemini PG interface I plan to write as soon as I have a chance, the
UI will be entirely in English, the only language I speak.  When you are
searching, you can include words in the query like &quot;lang:en&quot; or
&quot;media:text/plain&quot; or &quot;author:Twain&quot;, as well as plain words in any script,
more or less like Google Search.

All Gaul is divided into three parts: the part that cooks with lard and
goose
fat, the part that cooks with olive oil, and the part that cooks with
butter.
