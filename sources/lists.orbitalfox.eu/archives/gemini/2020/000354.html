God, I hate computers.

But, many thanks for bringing this to my attention.

Unicode is already a first-class citizen in Gemini (text/gemini is
assumed to be UTF-8 if a different encoding is not explicitly provided
in the response header), and I don't think I have any interest in
changing that.

As for the present discussion...well, it's obvious this problem is no
less of a problem under paragraph-oriented &quot;bidirectional&quot; reflowing.
It's not obvious to me if it's less of a problem under a Gopher-style
hard-wrapping to a pre-defined maximum width model....I suppose if the
width of line including CJK characters is dependent upon the combination
of font and terminal being used (I don't know if it is, but it seems
probable) then it's not actually possible for a CJK-using author to
comply with a spec like &quot;Hard-wrap all your content at X characters&quot;...

Hmm...
