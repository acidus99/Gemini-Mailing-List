Point taken.

Yep, as stated, this should have been &quot;LR or CRLF&quot;.  Speccing that would
require minimal changes to servers (which could just serve files
verbatim and assume nobody is generating CR-only files in this day and
age), and clients (most of which could handle these two with either no
trouble or minimal trouble).

But doesn't just picking two out of the three seem lazy?  Or is that
just me?  Is it okay in 2020 to just write bare CR out of existence?

&gt;<i> &gt; We basically need to choose between forcing server authors to normalise
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all endings to CRLF or forcing client authors to recgonise LF (even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; though it'll probably never be seen in the wild).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Would that be only for text/gemini?  Or all of the text/* formats?
</I>
Ugh.  Let me think...

Cheers,
