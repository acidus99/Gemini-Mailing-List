<PRE>But is it a zero sum game like that really (either make it hard on server
authors or make it hard on content authors)?

The would-be Gemini content author at this point in the game will be
someone who either has created an SSH key and SSHed into a pubnix, used Git
to send their content to a Dome style server or used sftp to upload their
hand written Gemini text.

Is it truly making their life harder to enter:

gemini fmt mytext.gemini&lt;Enter&gt;

and thereby save the server and client authors from having to do all of
that checking logic? They're still are many other ways they can enjoy the
moving target development against an evolving spec aren't there?

:<i>)
</I>
I hope my idea doesn't seem hostile somehow, because it's not intended to
be in any way. I just figure save everybody effort and complexity,
everybody wins&#8230; feed two birds with one seed.

Thanks
