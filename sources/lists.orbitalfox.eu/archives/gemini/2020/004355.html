Just an anecdote I briefly brought up on IRC...

I briefly experimented with percent-encoded Japanese and Norwegian
addresses on some of my capsules, but quickly gave up and went back to 
pure ASCII. *Not* because typing in percent-encoded names was annoying,
but because I realized how hard it was to verbally convey my Japanese
addresses to my Norwegian friends and vice versa. The de facto
universality of ASCII might something to embrace, not something to run away
from, if we want to be serious about being inclusive.

(marc - your posts in this thread have been great.. really appreciate
them!)
