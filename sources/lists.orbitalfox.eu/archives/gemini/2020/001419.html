<PRE>I&#8217;ve added support for client certificates in the latest build, basing
mostly on implementation of AV-98. There&#8217;s a weird bug when using
<A HREF="gemini://astrobotany.mozz.us/">gemini://astrobotany.mozz.us/</A> which requires restart of client for
certificate to work (and for it be deactivated) but
<A HREF="gemini://gemini.conman.org/private/">gemini://gemini.conman.org/private/</A> works properly. Are there any other
servers requiring client certificates that I can test against?

I also updated code to comply with updates to Gemini protocol. Looking
forward to seeing status code 11 in the wild :)

&gt;<i> Thanks. These responses and re-reading the spec clarified my initial

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am still unclear as to what happens after a transient certificate has

</I>&gt;<i> solution here. Either certificate is sent only when server requests it,

</I>&gt;<i> always use it for them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And additionally, should browser ask user for every page that requires a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it's that the client generates a single self-signed client cert the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> host as part of every single request: PLEASE DON'T DO THAT!  This is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about as wrong an implementation of Gemini's idea of client certificates
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as possible.  The vast majority of URLs will not require or expect a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client cert (which is why there's a way for servers to explicitly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> request one in the unusual circumstance it's needed), and any you send
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will just be ignored.  You will be needlessly increasing the TLS overhead
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (which is already pretty heavy relative to typical text/gemini payload
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sizes) for no gain.  Worse, admins of unrelated servers would be able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compare their logs and track you across Geminispace.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it's that you generate a single certificate the first time it starts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up but only send it out in response to a status code of 62 that's a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different matter (I assume it goes without saying you shouldn't ever use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it in response to a status code of 61 because the behaviour for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transient certs is extremely clearly specced and this would fly in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> face of just about every part of it).  I still think it's the wrong
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thing to do, but it's slightly less disasterous than the first option.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Client certificates should be handled in a very deliberate manner - the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user needs make the clear decision to opt in, on their own terms, to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being identified to some server(s).  It's an exceptional condition and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should never be automated or hidden from the user for the sake of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> convenience.  Sharing a single certificate across domains isn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something anybody should ever do lightly.
