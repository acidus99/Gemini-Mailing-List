This seems like a good change in principle. The articles still contain
large chunks of uncited claims, or claims that  and IME could be swept
up any minute now for that reason.

&gt;<i> Previous contributors to this mailing list highlighted the problem that

It's not so much an issue in my opinion. Wikipedia has a bar of entry
in terms of notability for a reason, and it should function more as an
encyclopedia (where the content reflects popular opinion on facts) than
an everything-site that people can use to promote their projects.

If we can manipulate the process of creating a popular opinion on facts
in a benign way (by &quot;marketing&quot;) then maybe we should go ahead, but I
think this also happens naturally as subjects gain notability: whatever
we do, Wikipedia notability should be a side effect, not an end.

Tangential funny Wikipedia story:
