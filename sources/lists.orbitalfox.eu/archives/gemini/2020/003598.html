I like to think of gemini as TLS + TOFU whereas the web uses TLS + PKI. TLS by
itself is not a complete security model without something on top of it to
establish trust.

We're talking about validating x509 certs here which were literally designed to
work with PKI [0]. Using them in any other context is throwing the whole
security model out the window. Nobody can &quot;rely&quot; on x509 parameters in
that sense. They might think they can, and giving them that false sense of
security is the wrong thing to do.

(are there other types of certs that can be used with TLS? I have no idea, but
if so I bet they aren't supported by openssl...)
