And my understanding is that while Gemini isn't supposed to be a Gopher 2.0,
it's supposed to make it better than Gopher. I think that non-hard-wrapping
could be a big step towards this goal.

</I>
Honestly, even if it takes 40 lines of code, I'd rather write that then
manually wrap every single gemini document I ever write. 

&gt;<i> What are other people doing, writing in &quot;long line&quot; form and

</I>
For things such as email, after manually wrapping quotes, I think using
`fmt` or `par` is the most efficient way to wrap text. However, this only
works for text that's written once, such as emails. This doesn't work for
continually edited content such as websites.

&gt;<i> If you're hosting shared gemini content for a group of non-technical users,
</I>&gt;<i> it might make sense for your server to automatically reformat gemini files
</I>&gt;<i> before sending them
</I>
I don't have a problem with people &quot;rendering&quot; into Gemini. I just think that
the spec shouldn't make it necessary. Rendering/compiling into Gemini adds
a level of indirection that hides the transparency that makes me love the
protocol.

Cheers!
