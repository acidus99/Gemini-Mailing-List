This is unavoidable in any case of adding a sufficient number of
features that can be combined. If every feature proposal should be
evaluated in terms of the slippery slope of &quot;what if we add more&quot; there
wouldn't be a point to discussing additions to the protocol, a notion
that I'm actually partial to, but that I think shouldn't be used as a
basis for judging against individual feature proposals.

Okay, I'm glad that you picked it up even when it wasn't addressed
directly at you. Consider the option, and why I believe that using the
2x range is inappropriate.

&gt;<i>   The concern is over large responses.  It wasn't much of a concern until

That would be a nice feature, but is it nice enough to warrant breakage
across the growing number of implementations? text/gemini documents can
display an estimated size for linked files, and a user can configure
their automatic client to abort at a certain point or choose in their
interactive client to cancel a request. Not a complete solution by any
means, but worth considering as it is much cheaper.

No-cache/please-cache 2x responses however seem like they can add a lot
of value for very little cost. Existing client implementations will be
compatible, and the idea of the second digit as a hint from the server
that can be ignored by a simpler client is retained.
