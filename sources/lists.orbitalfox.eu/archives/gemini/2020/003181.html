</I>
It would be the only markup that isn't entirely line prefix based and
would complicate parsing a lot potentially invalidating straight forward
techniques that clients are already using. Rendering something like
*this* as italic text may also be surprisingly error prone, considering
other contexts in which one might want to use &quot;*&quot; and the different
sequences of text one might want to emphasize. It's something Markdown
parsers frequently get wrong, or at the very least causes unintuitive
problems.

I agree that Unicode is not a good solution to the problem since the
italic blocks are intended for mathematical use, not emphasis. Unicode
deliberately avoids repeating the work of what the consortium thinks
belongs to a markup language (but does not show the same apprehension
for pictures of levitating men in business suits).

Perhaps some clients could optionally choose to interpret &quot;*-encoded&quot;
italics in the way you suggest in a way that's easy to toggle. Such a
feature is either allowed (&quot;Text lines may be presented to the user in
a visually pleasing manner for general reading, the precise meaning of
which is at the client's discretion.&quot;) or prohibited (&quot;Authors should
not expect to exercise any control over the precise rendering of their
text lines, only of their actual textual content.&quot;) depending on your
reading of the spec. But do consider the way in which I might started
an emphasis block earlier in this paragrah, which I'll now complete: *
