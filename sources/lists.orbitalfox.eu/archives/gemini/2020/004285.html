<PRE>Gemini spec does not mention caching, and the FAQ says:

 &gt; Gemini has no support for caching

So I was a bit surprised when I was putting together some dynamic 
content for my capsule and found that my client (amfora) was caching 
things. I was able to get around it by using temporary redirects to add 
cache busting query strings.

I don't have much experience with gopher, but I have seen that this has 
been a problem in the gopherspace. On the mozz.us phlog entry for his 
Rock Paper Scissors game he notes:

 &gt; The random token at the end of the URL (e.g &quot;/bfhqK3kH&quot;) doesn't
 &gt; actually represent anything. I only added it for cache-busting on
 &gt; lynx (otherwise you would always see the same result as the first
 &gt; time you loaded the page). I really hate doing that because it screws
 &gt; with the purity of my gopher routes. But a lot of people (including
 &gt; myself) use lynx. It sort of reminds me of JS hacking to support old
 &gt; Internet Explorer versions.

( <A HREF="gopher://mozz.us:70/1/phlog">gopher://mozz.us:70/1/phlog</A> 2019-04-12 )

Is there some guarantee that a capsule writer has on what may _not_ be 
cached, or is it entirely up to the client's discretion? If the latter, 
is this something which could be clarified in the spec? My impression 
from this ML was that caching is frowned upon (except for perhaps 
navigating back and forth through your history), but this has not been 
my experience (at least with amfora).
