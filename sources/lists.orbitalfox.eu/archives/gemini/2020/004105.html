I think the primary advantage of this bookmarks .gmi format would be interchange between clients (and instances of the same client) without humans editing the file. I don't think a client would want to store their bookmarks in this format, as there may be additional (possible internal) metadata to deal with, too.

When it comes to manual editing, I could see reordering and tagging your existing bookmarks as real-world use cases, and a simple line-based format makes these quite straightforward. But in any case, I'd probably prefer doing this via the client GUI myself.

&gt;<i> Maybe one browser will use text lines as comments, and another will use

</I>
A simple companion spec for client bookmark exchange similar to the Gemini subscriptions one should solve this problem adequately by defining what is meaningful and what should be ignored. Another format like XBEL could still be used if one's client supports additional information per bookmark.

&gt;<i> XML and the XBEL spec prevents these issues at the expense of user writing.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure how many users really are going to be writing their own
</I>&gt;<i> bookmarks though, and of those, how many are going to have trouble with XML.
</I>
XBEL is certainly an existing solution to exchanging bookmarks, and but it would be nice to have something that is compatible with the Gemini ethos. Personally I would even prefer JSON-based formats to XML (easier to parser, easier for humans to read), but gemtext has the unique advantage of being viewable by all clients even if they have no concept of importing bookmarks, or bookmarks in general.
