Welcome to the ecosystem!

Its great to see another client. There are a couple of other clients 
that support tabs like Kristall and amfora (that I know of). Others take 
the approach of forking the browsing session with a new window (like my 
own, GemiNaut). Personally I like to be able to use the normal OS 
features to manage application windows, and each fork of the browsing 
session feels more to me like a separate thread through Geminispace to 
be independently minimised, maximised, etc. Some folk seem to prefer 
tabs though.

On a slightly separate note, I saw from your profile you have a 
background in FirefoxOS. I know it had its ups and downs, but it does 
live on in KaiOS which is gaining a wide user base particularly outside 
Europe and North America. I have a a Nokia 2720 which I love as a flip 
phone, for its relative simplicity and for its battery life. There is a 
simple marketplace of apps.

So a quick question - do you think it could be possible to write a 
gemini client for KaiOS? Personally, it would be great to be able to 
check a few pages when on the move. And more importantly, it would open 
gemini up to a wide and diverse range of potential new users who may 
have a lot to contribute.

Best Wishes
