<PRE>OK, I've been doing some &quot;light reading&quot; about this topic, and this is
what I've found out so far.

(Although I think the change of adopting anything besides TLS is
closer to 0 at this moment, which I would say is a shame...)




#### About &quot;pro-TLS&quot;, and &quot;don't roll your own&quot;

[I.e.  This part is a counter argument to my previous emails.  I still
think we can do &quot;simpler&quot;, but I do like to be fair, and thus I'm
debating myself...]  :)


Bellow I'll point out three articles, written by three different
people (which after searching the internet seem to be knowledgeable in
this domain, perhaps not Schneier / Bernstein level, but still much
better than the average developer), in a time span of about 10 years.
(The section we are interested in is `client-server application
security`, and not `website security` because the later actually means
&quot;HTTPS security&quot;, thus TLS is mandatory, although the former
completely ignores certificates, as in X.509, thus only SSH-like
assumptions.)

* [2015]  <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/tqbf/be58d2d39690c3b366ad">https://gist.github.com/tqbf/be58d2d39690c3b366ad</A>

&gt;<i>From [2009] (although I would say it's an incomplete advice as it
</I>doesn't say what to do next):
~~~~
One of the reasons OpenSSL has such a poor track record is that the
SSL protocol itself is highly complex. Certificate chains, revocation
lists, ASN.1, multiple different hashing and encryption schemes...
when you have over a hundred thousand lines of code, it's no wonder
that bugs creep in.
~~~~


&gt;<i>From [2015] (Colin is the author of the [2009] article):
</I>~~~~
What happens when you design your own custom RSA protocol is that 1-18
months afterward, hopefully sooner but often later, you discover that
you made a mistake and your protocol had virtually no security. That
happened to Colin, but a better example is Salt Stack. Salt managed to
deploy e=1 RSA.

[...]

Most of these attacks can be mitigated by hardcoding TLS 1.2+, ECDHE
and AES-GCM. That sounds tricky, and it is, but it's less tricky than
designing your own transport protocol with ECDHE and AES-GCM!

In a custom transport scenario, you don't need to depend on CAs: you
can self-sign a certificate and ship it with your code, just like
Colin suggests you do with RSA keys.

Avoid: designing your own encrypted transport, which is a genuinely
hard engineering problem; using TLS but in a default configuration,
like, with &quot;curl&quot;; using &quot;curl&quot;, IPSEC.
~~~~


&gt;<i>From [2018]:
</I>~~~~
In custom protocols, you don&#8217;t have to (and shouldn&#8217;t) depend on 3rd
party CAs. You don&#8217;t even have to use CAs at all (though it&#8217;s not hard
to set up your own); you can just use a whitelist of self-signed
certificates &#8212; which is approximately what SSH does by default, and
what you&#8217;d come up with on your own.

Since you&#8217;re doing a custom protocol, you can use the best possible
TLS cipher suites: TLS 1.2+, Curve25519, and ChaPoly. That eliminates
most attacks on TLS. The reason everyone doesn&#8217;t do this is that they
need backwards-compatibility, but in custom protocols you don&#8217;t need
that.

[...]

Avoid: designing your own encrypted transport, which is a genuinely
hard engineering problem; using TLS but in a default configuration,
like, with &#8220;curl&#8221;; using &#8220;curl&#8221;, IPSEC.
~~~~


The takeaway:  if we go with TLS, let's mandate:
* TLS 1.2 with TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
  <A HREF="https://ciphersuite.info/cs/TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256">https://ciphersuite.info/cs/TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256</A>
* or, TLS 1.3 with TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
  <A HREF="https://ciphersuite.info/cs/TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256">https://ciphersuite.info/cs/TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256</A>
* as for certificates only ECDSA, which seem to be available also via
Lets Encrypt;

These options are also suggested by both Mozilla and CloudFlare:
* <A HREF="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS</A>
* <A HREF="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/ssl-tls/cipher-suites">https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/ssl-tls/cipher-suites</A>




#### About the noise protocol

I've glossed over the Noise protocol specification, however before
getting into that I've read the first link bellow:

* <A HREF="https://latacora.micro.blog/factoring-the-noise/">https://latacora.micro.blog/factoring-the-noise/</A>
* <A HREF="https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html">https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html</A>  (this is the actual specification);

Basically I think the only Noise protocol instance that pertains to
`<A HREF="gemini://`">gemini://`</A> is the `XX` exchange pattern, citing from the first link
above:
~~~~
XX and XK require an extra round trip before they send over the
initiator&#8217;s static key. Flip side: they have the strongest possible
privacy protection for the initiator, whose identity is only sent to
the responder after they&#8217;ve been authenticated and forward secrecy has
been established.
~~~~

In fact Alexey Ermishkin together with Trevor Perrin (the original
author of the protocol) have started a project called NoiseSocket,
which basically just focuses on the the `XX` pattern.  (As for
credentials, Trevor Perrin worked for WhatsApp in designing the Noise
protocol, which is still used today.)

* <A HREF="https://github.com/noisesocket/spec">https://github.com/noisesocket/spec</A>
* <A HREF="https://noisesocket.org/post/1/">https://noisesocket.org/post/1/</A> -- I strongly suggest reading this
document if one is interested in the Noise protocol;

The only disadvantage with Noise (or NoiseSocket) is that given the
frame size is limited to 64K, in case of `<A HREF="gemini://`">gemini://`</A> we need to
implement extra &quot;chunking&quot; for it to work for bodies.  (Alternatively
we can just use it as we do TLS, namely a &quot;stupid pipe that just
applies encryption&quot;...)




####  The part about other alternatives

I've found the following project that also does a &quot;state-of-the-art&quot;
analysis (though granted in 2015):

* <A HREF="https://github.com/auditdrivencrypto/secure-channel">https://github.com/auditdrivencrypto/secure-channel</A>
* <A HREF="https://github.com/auditdrivencrypto/secure-channel/blob/master/prior-art.md">https://github.com/auditdrivencrypto/secure-channel/blob/master/prior-art.md</A>
* <A HREF="https://github.com/auditdrivencrypto/secure-channel/blob/master/properties.md">https://github.com/auditdrivencrypto/secure-channel/blob/master/properties.md</A>
* <A HREF="https://github.com/auditdrivencrypto/secure-channel/blob/master/draft.md">https://github.com/auditdrivencrypto/secure-channel/blob/master/draft.md</A>
* <A HREF="https://github.com/auditdrivencrypto/secure-channel/blob/master/draft2.md">https://github.com/auditdrivencrypto/secure-channel/blob/master/draft2.md</A>

(I don't know his credentials, thus I would assume nothing.)

The &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; is quite &quot;high-level&quot;, but it provides a nice
starting point.  The properties document is a good check-list to
analyze any proposal against.  (The only issue, is that he is
interested in building a peer-to-peer network, thus at least the
public key of the server is known in advance.)

The second draft (i.e. `draft2.md` above) is quite interesting,
although as said it does one require to know beforehand the server's
public key.




####  About my previous proposal

I'll have to think harder about it (within my limited cryptographic
expertise), and perhaps submit it to a cryptographers community for
feedback.

At the moment I can see only a minor privacy flaw in it:  the client
discloses its identity (and proof of identity) to any server;  instead
it should first wait for the server to disclose its identity (and
proof of identity) before proceeding.

This issue stems from the fact that the `transport_prepare` function
is &quot;symmetrical&quot; and tries to reduce network round-trips;  instead the
client could first wait for the server verifier and then send its own
(i.e. just a minor change to that function).

Ciprian.
