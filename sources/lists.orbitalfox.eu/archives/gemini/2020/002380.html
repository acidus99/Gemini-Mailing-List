<PRE>&gt;<i> If nothing else, I think there's a small, useful role for a very simple
</I>&gt;<i> caching proxy which just maintains an in-memory cache of everything
</I>&gt;<i> visited which is valid for, say, five minutes. The reason this is
</I>&gt;<i> useful is that navigating Gemini capsules often involves extensive use
</I>&gt;<i> of the &quot;back button&quot; (and, at least for me on AV-98, the &quot;up&quot; command,
</I>&gt;<i> which gets you from example.com/foo/bar/baz to to example.com/foo/bar/
</I>&gt;<i> even in the lack of an explicit link, and the &quot;root&quot; command, which gets
</I>&gt;<i> you from example.com/foo/bar/baz to to example.com), which often entails
</I>&gt;<i> loading the same page repeatedly in a relatively short window of time.
</I>&gt;<i> A very simple dumb local cache would cut down on transactions for this.
</I>
I think this is often best relegated to the client, but I see how it's nice
for the client not to have to worry about it, and to have this other proxy instead.
I was originally picturing something longer lived, so that it would still be
useful along with any caches the client already has, but I'm not sure how much
sense that makes.

&gt;<i> For people like me who often read something in Gemini/Gopherspace, then
</I>&gt;<i> want to reference a few days later but cannot remember where they read
</I>&gt;<i> it, a proxy which maintained full-text search of everything visited in
</I>&gt;<i> the past month or so would be super handy, but I have no idea how to
</I>&gt;<i> build such a thing.
</I>
Me neither, but that definitely seems cool. I'm sure Natpen would have an
idea on how to do this :). It's also a nice way to keep history for clients
that don't do that (all of them?). The full text search also doubles as an
archive of all the sites you visit.
