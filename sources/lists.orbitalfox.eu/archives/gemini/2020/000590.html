I have found both of these servers very difficult to install. With
gemserv, I tried debian's packaged rust, rustup, and rustup nightly.
All failed for different interesting reasons. I could never get the
dependencies sorted out for GLV-1.12556.

Jetforce is very easy to install with pip, which is probably why it's
the most used server currently.

I'm using molly-brown currently, because I like how it handles user
public_gemini directories. Full cgi support would be nice.

Thanks for all the hard work all you software developers are doing!

</I>&gt;<i>   What do you mean by &quot;most mature&quot;?  By age, it's GLV-1.12556 (disclaimer:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 		* support for any type of documents (from multiple directories)
</I>&gt;<i> 		* CGI (both Gemini and HTTP specific, RFC-3875 compliant)
</I>&gt;<i> 		* user directories
</I>&gt;<i> 		* client certificate support
</I>&gt;<i> 		* easy to extend with custom modules (if you know Lua)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and Gemserv:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 		* support for any type of document
</I>&gt;<i> 		* CGI (Gemini only, not quite RFC-3875 compliant)
</I>&gt;<i> 		* user directories
</I>&gt;<i> 		* reverse proxy
</I>&gt;<i> 		* virtual hosts
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Both have recent updates. By popularity, last time I checked, it was
</I>&gt;<i> JetForce (which also has had recent updates).  Of the three mentioned,
</I>&gt;<i> JetForce is in Python, Gemserv in Rust, and GLV-1.12556 in Lua.  The lack of
</I>&gt;<i> virtual hosting in GLV-1.12556 is because I lack experience in dealing with
</I>&gt;<i> server certificates with multple hosts, and because of that, I can't exactly
</I>&gt;<i> test that feature.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On the software list [1], there is no description about the state and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feature set of any of the listed server software.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I only need to serve static files, as everything else happens on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; static site generator before being uploaded.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   If that's the case, then most of the servers would probably work, it then
</I>&gt;<i> comes down to which language do you have available for compiling/running the
