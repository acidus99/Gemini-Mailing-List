<PRE>There's been a lot of discussions about the lack of an end-of-message
indicator in the protocol. Clearly it's something that a lot of client and
server implementers are missing.

A proposal that arose (I think acdw may have been the first to suggest it;
correct me if I'm wrong) was to include a &quot;content-length: &lt;nr of bytes&gt;&quot;
in the &lt;META&gt; of a status 20 response. It's a simple thing to add, that
doesn't extend the protocol into bloat.

&quot;But, ew0k! The &lt;META&gt; is for MIME types! That's not a MIME type!&quot;

Yes, this is true. Would that cause an issue? In that case calling it
&quot;x-gemi-content-length&quot; should resolve it, as the &quot;x-&quot; prefix is for
experimental types and any receiver that doesn't recognize it will ignore
it. I'm aware that it still doesn't convey info on the *type* of content,
and thereby doesn't belong among MIME type info, but it's a compromise I'm
willing to make.

Are you?

Cheers,
BW/ew0k
