<PRE>So I wrote a gemlog about a gemini feed a few days ago, way before I
even knew it was an ongoing discussion:
<A HREF="gemini://tilde.team/~ew0k/is-this-aggregator-idea-good.gmi">gemini://tilde.team/~ew0k/is-this-aggregator-idea-good.gmi</A>

Obviously I'd given the matter a thorough 10 or so minutes before
sharing my thoughts :) I've thought a lot more on it since, and
received a great amount of feedback.

The format I proposed was this:

=&gt; FULLURLTOPOST TIMESTAMP, AUTHOR NAME, TITLE
For example:
=&gt; <A HREF="gemini://billsdomain.com/gemlog/posts/is-this-aggregator-idea-good.gmi">gemini://billsdomain.com/gemlog/posts/is-this-aggregator-idea-good.gmi</A>
2020-11-14T22:03:12+00:00, Bill P. Jones, Is This Aggregator Idea
Good?

Obviously my intended use case is *very* specific: I intended for a
feed aggregator to in turn produce a feed of the same format that it
was parsing to begin with, in order to allow recursive aggregation. In
that case the author's name becomes important, but if my &quot;feed&quot; is a
bunch of links from my own index page then putting my own name on
every link looks weird and feels redundant.

And timestamp... well... I hate it when posts end up in the wrong
order, but I have issues with the timestamp format I proposed myself
too:
- it's hardly human readable. Too long.
- The inclusion of a timezone makes lexicographic sort fallible. I
don't see how we can make everyone set a timestamp in UTC, though.
People will (and should, since it feels more natural to them) use
their own local time.

I don't want to be bikeshedding this issue, and I clearly see how my
own proposed format has flaws that are insurmountable if we want to
gain widespread adoption.

However... I don't see how an overly simplified format makes any sense
at all. I'd rather parse a bunch of atom feeds than aggregate a bunch
of link lists that will end up looking like this:

[1] 2020-11-21 - Re: My thoughts
[2] 2020-11-20 - My thoughts
[3] 2020-11-20 RE: My thoughts
[4] 2020-11-19 ~ew0k, A post!
[5] 2020-11-19 Diary Entry, ~someone

Cheers,
~ew0k
