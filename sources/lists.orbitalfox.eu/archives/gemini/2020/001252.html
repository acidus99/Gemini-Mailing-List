This sounds &quot;short and sweet&quot; and simple, but this basically makes
Gemini infinitely extensible.  Link lines stop having anything to do
with the concept of &quot;links&quot;, and become vehicles for anything that
somebody wants to come up with a URI scheme for, which is a large and
totally open category which will grow over time and may come to include
very scary things (for the love of God, there was an IETF draft for a
javascript: scheme! [1]).  Giving clients the power to recognise any old
scheme which comes along is guaranteed to induce a repeat of the
evolution of the web.  Basically we can now think of the line:

=&gt; scheme:restofuri Human friendly label

as equivalent to something like:

&lt;scheme arg1=&quot;restofuri&quot; arg2=&quot;Human friendly label&quot;/&gt;

text/gemini would be fully as extensible as HTML where client authors
can just invent new tags like &lt;blink&gt; and &lt;marquee&gt;.  It's exactly what
nobody here wants.

I am *so angry* that there isn't a construct in the internet
architecture which is *nothing more* than a convenient way to concisely
specify an application protocol, a hostname or IP address, a port, and
a path.  This is such an obviously useful thing to have.  It's what
almost everybody *thinks* a URL is, but it turns out that's wrong.  Who
would have thought that Gopher's clunky and archaic notation of:

path&lt;TAB&gt;hostname&lt;TAB&gt;port&lt;TAB&gt;

literally has not been improved on in ~30 years?

At this point I am honestly considering speccing that =&gt; lines may
*only* use URLs whose scheme corresponds to an application protocol.
Permitting *any* RFC-compliant URL is just way, way too open-ended and
defeats the point of so much careful efforts elsewhere in the protocol.

Cheers,
