<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Remco once stated:
&gt;<i> Here's what the expose.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> # GLV-1.12556
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; <A HREF="https://github.com/spc476/GLV-1.12556/blob/13d52b63/Lua/GLV-1/gateway.lua#L156">https://github.com/spc476/GLV-1.12556/blob/13d52b63/Lua/GLV-1/gateway.lua#L156</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * AUTH_TYPE : &quot;Certificate&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> * REMOTE_USER : client certificate X509 subject common name
</I>&gt;<i> * TLS_CLIENT_HASH : certificate fingerprint
</I>&gt;<i> * TLS_CLIENT_ISSUER : certificate X509 issuer
</I>&gt;<i> * TLS_CLIENT_ISSUER_* : certificate X509 issuer sub fields
</I>&gt;<i> * TLS_CLIENT_NOT_AFTER : certificate end date
</I>&gt;<i> * TLS_CLIENT_NOT_BEFORE : certificate start date
</I>&gt;<i> * TLS_CLIENT_REMAIN : certificate days left
</I>&gt;<i> * TLS_CLIENT_SUBJECT : certificate X509 subject
</I>&gt;<i> * TLS_CLIENT_SUBJECT_* : certificate X509 subject sub fields
</I>
  When I wrote the CGI module for GLV-1.12556, I modelled mine after what
Apache did, but renamed the TLS environment variables to better names.  I
figured why not?  And it's not as if all of it is needed, but I was able to
send it.

  Another aspect of GLV-1.12556 is that unless configured otherwise, a CGI
script called with a client certificate will *only* get AUTH_TYPE and
REMOTE_USER set.  AUTH_TYPE and REMOTE_USER are required by the CGI spec.

&gt;<i> But that brings me to the real question here.  Does gemini need a CGI
</I>&gt;<i> spec?  Given status code 42 for CGI errors, it kinda committed to
</I>&gt;<i> something CGI-ish without actually stating what that is.  The only
</I>&gt;<i> server making the effort to implement CGI/1.1 is GLV but, IMHO, that
</I>&gt;<i> isn't the kind of simplicity I am here for and it's a bit of a hack to
</I>&gt;<i> be honest.
</I>
  Don't be mislead by GLV-1.12556.  Supporting CGI/1.1 isn't hard---the
complexity I have is in supporting CGI scripts meant for the web and
possibly Apache.  I did add the following variables for convenience:

	GEMINI_DOCUMENT_ROOT   = directory
	GEMINI_SCRIPT_FILENAME = full_path_to_script
	GEMINI_URL_PATH        = location.path
	GEMINI_URL             = request

&gt;<i> GLV does manage to make CGI scripts more portable, whereas other servers
</I>&gt;<i> don't really make the effort.  For instance, some don't provide
</I>&gt;<i> PATH_INFO but do provide PATH_TRANSLATED and others provide neither.  I
</I>&gt;<i> would like to share my CGI-scripts and have them run anywhere but to
</I>&gt;<i> make sharing easier something like a spec would be nice.  What do you
</I>&gt;<i> think?
</I>
  I think it's easy enough to follow RFC-3875 (the CGI/1.1 spec).  It's not
that hard.  It's just:

	GATEWAY_INTERFACE      = &quot;CGI/1.1&quot;
	QUERY_STRING           = location.query or &quot;&quot; -- Must be set
	REMOTE_ADDR            = auth._remote
	REMOTE_HOST            = auth._remote
	SCRIPT_NAME            = base
	SERVER_NAME            = location.host
	SERVER_PORT            = tostring(location.port)
	SERVER_SOFTWARE        = &quot;GLV-1.12556/1&quot;
	AUTH_TYPE              = &quot;Certificate&quot; -- only if client cert
	REMOTE_USER            = auth.subject.CN or &quot;&quot; -- only if client cert
	PATH_INFO              = ... okay, some explanation required [1]
	PATH_TRANSLATED        = ... okay, some explanation required [1]

  Other variables are possible, but should be prefixed by the protocol name.

  -spc

[1]	These last two require a bit more explanation to set correctly that
	I don't have time for in this message.  I'll circle back to this
	later tonight when I have a bit more time.
