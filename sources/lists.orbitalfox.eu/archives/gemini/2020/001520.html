Hmm...I think I like this.  I mean, I'm never *super* excited when
redirects are involved, but this workflow would allow us to spec
that the default scope of a cert is all paths below the URI from
which the 6x status was received (which lets client certs be much
narrower in scope than cookies, which IMHO is a good selling point)
and still allow human-readable &lt;META&gt; for 6x statuses to provide
hints about expected certificate lifespan.

Cheers,
