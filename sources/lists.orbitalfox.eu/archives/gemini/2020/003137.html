You're mistaking the sense in which khuxkm is saying that it can't
happen. It did happen in the sense that you implemented a server for a
protocol that works like this.

It can't happen in the sense that it fundamentally breaks compatibility
with clients that only concern themselves with the first digit of the
response code. That you've implemented the resulting protocol of your
suggested change has no bearing on the argument.

The overflowing of 2x code resulting from a combinatorial hell is
entirely self-inflicted through your choice to ignore this aspect of
the existing specification.

I've already suggested to you a way to avoid this (use a different
first digit). This additionally avoids having to rewrite 3.2 of the
spec and invalidate existing clients that take for granted that &quot;the
first digit alone provides enough information for a client to determine
how to handle the response&quot;.

Moreover, with TLS already having a mechanism to signal the intended
end of a connection, I don't think that content size is a pressing
issue. It would allow for download progress bars, but adds nothing
over TLS in terms of ensuring that the content is fully received.
