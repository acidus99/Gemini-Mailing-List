<PRE>I am an author of a feed reader and I thought about implementing this
after I read this, but there are some problems:

How should my feed reader behave if there are links to different paths
on the page? I think I should reject all links from a different domain
and from a different protocol, but there could be a link to the same
domain, but to a different path.

=&gt; / back
=&gt; /gemlog/1/ post 1
=&gt; /gemlog/2/ post 2
=&gt; /contact/ contact to me

Here, it is visible which ones are the blog entries and which ones are
something else, but a program would have to guess. I don't think it
would be a good idea to hardcode that everything with gemlog in the path
is a feed item, that would cause too much confusion. Also, different
clients would behave differently adding to the confusion.

It is a great idea, but I think we could instead write a script or a
cli-program which would output Atom/RSS/Json feed for a gemini URL
given. This program would do the neccessary guessing and parsing and
output something that can be understood by all RSS libraries and
clients. Some clients I know support running a command to get a feed.

Or we could just use gemfeed to generate Atom for us.
