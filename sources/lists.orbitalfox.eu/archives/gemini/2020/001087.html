</I>
I use it for gemlikes, because it's just a really simple way to prevent
spam without having to complicate things with client certs. Client
certs are great, but as you said, it would be a huge hassle to have
to do it for each site.

I providing the IP address is fine, and applications can use it if they
want. Trying to restrict apps from accessing it will give people a false
sense of security, I think.
