<PRE>Hello geminauts!

First time poster here.

I recognize some familiar names here and I try to keep up with the list 
when I can, but there's usually too much going on here (not a bad 
problem to have).

First, I'd like to announce that I've set up user hosting on tilde.team 
with gemserv out of ~/public_gemini[0]. I'm looking forward to seeing 
more user content!

I've also set up a homepage for the tildeverse[1].

If you've been on irc, you've probably heard about my troubleshooting on 
getting gemserv up and running!

Now some notes about tildegit.org, where some notable projects are hosted:

- registration on tildegit is whitelisted to tilde email addresses 
(namely from tildeverse members and known pubnixes). feel free to 
contact me (email is fine, irc is preferred) if you don't have a tilde 
email address and I'd be happy to set up an account for you. Otherwise, 
you might consider signing up for a tilde account! :)

- gitea, the software that powers tildegit.org, does not support 
incoming email (i know, it's unfortunate), and I've been receiving 
plenty of mails of people replying to issues/PRs that end up in my inbox 
and not on the issue as you might expect. there's an existing issue for 
incoming mail for gitea, but it hasn't seen much traction. [2]

Cheers,
~ben
