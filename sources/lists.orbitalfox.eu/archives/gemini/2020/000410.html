If 'paragraphs' are always written as continuous long lines, this works.
If they get written as hard-wrapped 80-column lines, then you get the
existing issue on narrow displays. So specifying this implementation of
wrapping is also a recommendation to authors to write paragraphs as
continuous long lines, I guess.

It's not bad. It preserves quality 1 (ease of implementation) and 2
(some richness allowed by literal text formatting), and *may* get you 3
most of the time, as long as authors comply with the recommendation.

I'd recommend, if you go with this, to not also include the ``` literal
formatting. There's going to be a breakpoint of complexity somewhere
where text/gemini will not do the job you want it to, and you should be
serving text/markdown or even text/html.
