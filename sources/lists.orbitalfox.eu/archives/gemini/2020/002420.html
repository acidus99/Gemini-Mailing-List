The Rust code is a little wonky -- I'm experimenting with writing a
little more &quot;low-level&quot; code than I usually would, not using an ORM,
relying less on libraries and frameworks, but I'd love some help. I put
together some GitHub issues. Side note -- I know GitHub is very
un-&quot;small web&quot;, but I am not super happy with the alternatives yet, so
consider it a necessary evil for now.

</I>
I had actually thought about this! My idea was that you could share a
page with other users so that they could edit it. It's a great idea, but
I also want to take an extremely conservative approach to adding new
features. Something I may implement down the road. Thanks for the
suggestion.


&gt;<i> Let me know what you think, and obviously would be totally happy to
