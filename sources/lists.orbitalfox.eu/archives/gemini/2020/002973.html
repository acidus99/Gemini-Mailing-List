The problem is that clients have no way to know how much stuff they're
receiving.  This would be helpful for interactive clients, so that they
can tell the user some indication of progress, and it would be helpful
for more constrained programs to know whether or not they can store all
their input.  Both of these points were raised in previous discussions.

AFAIK, all MIME parsers know to ignore additional MIME parameters.  Even
if someone who did not know about this concept were to see such an MIME
type, the idea is clear.  I don't see how including this is a problem.
