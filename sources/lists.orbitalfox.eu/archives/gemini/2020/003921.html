<PRE>It was thus said that the Great bie once stated:
&gt;<i> &gt;   I know Solderpunk wants to do a series of freezes then thaws as things are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worked on, but I think things progress a bit faster than he can deal with,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or wants to deal with, given his long absences on the list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd love to see a spec freeze, too. There are already a lot of gemini
</I>&gt;<i> servers, clients and other tools out there and breaking changes should
</I>&gt;<i> be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   For me personally, I think this should be worked out, and I'm working
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; towards that with my own server [1].  I've had to make changes to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GLV-1.12556 in the past when the protocol changed, I can change it again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How about waiting for a consensus to develop, *at the very least*?
</I>
  If I waited for consensus, Gemini would not be where it is today [1].
Also, it brought out a what I consider a bug in my code (generating links
from filenames) that it doesn't properly URL encode data [2].

&gt;<i> If the protocol were to change to allow IRIs, that's a *major breaking* 
</I>&gt;<i> change that to me, as someone actually serving non-English content, is
</I>&gt;<i> not only completely unnecessary but harmful.
</I>
  I don't expect that an IRI will be allowed for a request, but that an IRI
could be in a Gemini text file and it's up to the client to do the
conversion.  And it's that bit that I'm currently exploring.  

&gt;<i> 3. I'm still not convinced this would help anyone - IRIs still have
</I>&gt;<i> reserved characters that have to be properly encoded - so completely 
</I>&gt;<i> non-technical text/gemini authors will still have to rely on proper
</I>&gt;<i> tooling.
</I>
  And we won't know until somebody tries.

[1]	There's a reason why GLV-1.12556 and gemini.conman.org were the
	first Gemini server software and server in existance, becauxe I just
	went ahead and implemented it while solderpunk was still talking
	about it.  And I think the presense of GLV-1.12556 and
	gemini.conman.org sparked others to get busy.  And GLV-1.12556 was
	*NOT* following the specification at the time, as I disagreed with
	parts of the specification.

[2]	I don't have any non-ASCII file names, so it never crossed my mind
	to handle such things.  That is a blind spot as far as I'm
	concerned.
