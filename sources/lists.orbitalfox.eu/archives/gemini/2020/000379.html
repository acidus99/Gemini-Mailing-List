Hmm, I really would not have had any expectation that quoted Gemini
syntax would do anything at all.

What sort of context would you expect this to occur in?
 
&gt;<i> * Preformatted text toggle lines only need to *start* with three
</I>&gt;<i>   backticks. Specify the significance of text after the backticks.
</I>
I think I'm probably fine with this, does anybody have objections?
 
&gt;<i> * Specify that preformatted code blocks are intended for content such as
</I>&gt;<i>   ascii art and code, meaning that it should be easily copy-pasteable
</I>&gt;<i>   into a text editor without needed to undergo extra steps to revert it
</I>&gt;<i>   from its displayed form to its original form
</I>
Yeah, it might be a good idea to emphasise the intent to preserve
copy-and-pastability.

&gt;<i> * Add horizontal rule lines (three+ dashes)
</I>
I guess this is harmless.  It feels a bit to me like we're adding it
just because Markdown has it - unlike headings and lists and even,
occasionally, quotes, I don't know that I've ever seen a horiozontal
rule used in Gopherspace.  But I don't see a good reason to disallow it.

&gt;<i> * Specify that ordered lists MUST use plus sign markers
</I>
Yep.

&gt;<i> * Specify Tomasino's nested list system
</I>
I think I'm still onboard with this, although I'm starting to wonder
about how these nested lists will look when rendered by a basic client
treating them as text lines.  I'm not sure it degrades to something
terribly readable.

&gt;<i> * Explicitly specify markdown syntax that is not allowed.
</I>
It feels very strange to me for a syntax specification to explicitly
list stuff from a different syntax specification which isn't allowed.  I
can see it being helpful to point this stuff out in a tutorial for
people learning text/gemini, but in a formal specification of a markup
format, it goes without saying that anything which isn't explicitly
supported is unsupported.

&gt;<i>   but maybe we could even advise clients to shame this syntax the same
</I>&gt;<i>   way modern web browsers are shaming non-HTTP sites?
</I>
Wouldn't doing that (all questions about whether this is appropriate
behaviour aside) require writing code to detect all the stuff that we're
not supporting precisely because it's a pain to write code to reliably
detect it?  Seems counterproductive!

&gt;<i> Regardless, here
</I>&gt;<i>   are some things that I think we should explicitly ban in text/gemini: 
</I>&gt;<i>  ...
</I>&gt;<i>   * Hard-wrapping text
</I>
I don't want to explicitly ban hard-wrapped text, I don't see the need
to.  I think this syntax actually degrades pretty gracefully when fed
hard-wrapped text that is shorter than the viewport, and that's nice.  I
think the vast majoity of people will end up taking the long line
approach because it will support a wider range of clients (especially
narrow screens) and some things will render slightly nicer.  If a small
percentage want to stick to the old ways for whatever reason, knowing
and accepting the downsides, I see no reason not to let them.
 
&gt;<i> Are we really limited to a max depth of three? Even if we allow unlimited
</I>&gt;<i> depth of headers and lists, clients would only need to read the first two
</I>&gt;<i> chars of a line to determine its type (unless we add horizontal rules,
</I>&gt;<i> in which case we'd need to read three characters).
</I>
Good catch, technically speaking once a line is detected, on the basis
of the first three or fewer chars, as a header or list, it can be passed
to a function than handles a header line or a list line, and that
function has access to the whole line.

That said, maybe we should add a limit anyway.  Otherwise clients have
to write totally generalised code to handle arbitrarily many levels,
which could get tricky.
 
&gt;<i> Well, worst case scenario, if someone really badly wants comment threads,
</I>&gt;<i> maybe they could use nested quote blocks (assuming we figure that out).
</I>
Well, it seems like the &gt; syntax generalises in exactly the same way as
the heading and list syntaxes.

Speaking of these...what happens when a client encounters this:

** Foo
** Bar
** Baz

i.e. a bunch of allegedly nested list items which are not emedded in a
higher-level list?

For a simple text-based client which only uses the nestedness level to
determine how many spaces to stick in front of the line, this shouldn't
post major problems.  But fancy clients planning on doing graphical
things (I'm actually thinking more about quotes here than list items)
might choke if not carefully written.  Should we explicitly require
correct nesting?  Or explicitly say clients must be resilient against
weird nesting?

Cheers,
Solderpunk
