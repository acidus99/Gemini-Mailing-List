<PRE>Howdy,

Both your server and client are now on the appropriate lists, thanks for sharing!
It's nice to see another combined Gopher/Gemini client on the list.

I think the fact that Gemini documents can straightforwardly link out to
content on other protocols without resorting to hacks is one of its
nicer improvements over Gopher.  Clients which support both protocols
make it easier to take full advantage of that.

Hey, that's outstanding, good work!  I have always hoped that better
client design could be a solution to that problem, rather than adding
content length information into the response header.

Cheers,
