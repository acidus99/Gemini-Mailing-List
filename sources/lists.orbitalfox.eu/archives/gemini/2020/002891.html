<PRE>Greetings follows, I just found out about gemini recently and I got
interested in the project and wanted to be involved, In the process of
setting up my gempod (that's how you call them?), I wanted to be able
to have an HTML/HTTP mirror for my gempod and I haven't found a gemtext
to HTML converter so I decided to write my own, and in the middle of
the process I thought if I'm going write a full parser for gemtext,
I might as well make the code reusable and package it as a library, so
the project shifted from a gemtext to HTML tool to a gemtext processing
library, and here I am.

However, throughout implementing the parser, I got into many questions
about the spec, I can't really recall all of them right now but here
are a few:

- In 5.5.2 it is stated that lines beginning with &quot;* &quot; are elements of
an unordered list, and I assumed the space after '*' is required since 
it
is included in the double quotes, when I asked for clarification on IRC,
others suggested I handle '*' with or without space afterwards, so I 
did.

- In 5.5.3, I had the same question with quotes, the spec says &quot;&gt;&quot; which
sounds like there should be no space after &quot;&gt;&quot;, and if there is a space,
I should treat it like a part of the quote, I asked on IRC if I should
follow that behaviour but others also recommended that I should handle
spaces after &quot;&gt;&quot; just in case, which leaves me to think again if the
spec intended that or not.

- In 5.5.1, It is not explicitly stated how many heading levels are
allowed within the spec, I assumed it followed the same way markdown
does it allowing up to 6 levels, however, after asking on IRC, I was
told 3 is max, so I went with that.

As of now, my implementation is complete, It is almost usable for
anyone willing to test it, I wrote manpages for all functions currently
implemented, but not for the data types yet, I'm going to work on that,
and as part of my project, I want to write a manpage for the text/gemini
format (gemtext(5)) and I want it to be precise and spec compliant,
if you don't mind, I'll go ahead and write the manpage as a proposal to
standardize some of the unclear cases of the spec, if the rest of the
community agrees, maybe get the spec updated too?

Attached is a tarball of my current implementation (WIP)
