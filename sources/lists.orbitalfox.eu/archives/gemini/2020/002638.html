<PRE>Just to throw another idea out there:

There has been some extended discussion now on the mailing list about a
conflict in machine-readable vs human-readable content being added after
the opening pre-formatting ``` characters. It seems that enough people
in the Gemini community see both of these kinds of information as
providing value, but the spec currently lacks a clear path forward for
differentiating between them.

Right now, anything written after the closing pre-formatting ``` chars
isn't being used as per the spec's instructions. I can't help but wonder
what would happen if we were able to put machine-readable instructions
(like &quot;table&quot;, &quot;image&quot;, &quot;code:python&quot;) on the opening line (so that
clients could switch their line interpreter modes accordingly) and place
human-readable alt text (mainly for screen readers) on the closing line
(assuming the screen reader will probably just skip over the
pre-formatted block's contents anyway and then read the alt text if
provided).

I realize this would entail a fairly significant change to the spec, but
it seems - at least to me - to resolve the issue in a rather
straightforward fashion. If I'm missing something important here, please
let me know. I'm also interested in hearing anyone else's suggestions
for how to address this issue.

Onward Geminauts!
