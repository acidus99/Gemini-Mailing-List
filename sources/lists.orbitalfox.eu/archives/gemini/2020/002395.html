</I>
I understand. My intention was that, for a basic client, the input
would still work in the exact same way. You get a basic string, enter
something, it gets added as a query, and the server returns either a
2x or a 59. But the more advanced clients could provide an
alternate input method to make it easier for the user.

And, of course, repeating the mistakes of HTTP and HTML is something I
want to avoid as much as you.

&gt;<i> I think you'll find a discussion of this in the archives. Look for the
</I>&gt;<i> thread &quot;Reopening: Stream status code&quot;. I think the key message is this
</I>&gt;<i> one:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/002269.html">https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/002269.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;This is mainly just an issue of what to do about timeouts, right? If
</I>&gt;<i> you don't have any timeout at all, streamed content works fine, but
</I>&gt;<i> buggy/overloaded servers hang the client, and that's bad.  If you have
</I>&gt;<i> a fixed timeout of 5 seconds, some streaming applications (like the
</I>&gt;<i> chat example mozz has done) break.&quot;
</I>
I guess that ideally, any client would use threads or some other
mechanism to allow for the user to read the already-loaded parts of a
page while it's being loaded, while indicating that the page is
&quot;incomplete&quot; in some way in the user interface.

Then it wouldn't be necessary to specifically signal server-side
whether or not the page is streamed or loaded as a single piece.

&gt;<i> I think if you read the discussions regarding streaming, you'll see
</I>&gt;<i> that if the server doesn't hang up, and if clients don't implement
</I>&gt;<i> timeouts, all of this naturally just happens.
</I>
The third suggestion (appendable pages) was actually unrelated to
streaming. I was instead suggesting it as a way for applications to
send small messages in response to requests in a way that doesn't
require the server to re-send the original page every time.

&gt;<i> Sorry to be a cold blanket here, but my answer is No to all of the
</I>&gt;<i> ideas. Instead, with respect to your ideas, let's focus on these two
</I>&gt;<i> points:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Clients without timeouts with an appropriate UI to help users
</I>&gt;<i> interpret what they are seeing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Websites (&quot;applications&quot;) with appropriate user interfaces such that
</I>&gt;<i> we don't need structured input.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's doable, but it isn't as simple as it seems at first sight.
</I>
It's all okay. I understand and appreciate your responses anyway.

&gt;<i> Cheers
</I>&gt;<i> Alex

Thanks!
