This is basically the plan, I just want to get the current less formally
structured specification finalised before starting.  Translating it to a
proper RFC while it's still undergoing changes does not seem like a good
use of time/energy.

&gt;<i> 1 x IANA Registration for URI scheme <A HREF="gemini://:1965">gemini://:1965</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 1 x IANA Registration for Media Type text/gemini
</I>
We are not guaranteed to be able to get port 1965, as it's already
assigned by IANA - to some apparently obsolete commercial protocol now
owned (but not, as far as I can tell, actively used or promoted) by IBM.
I have no idea what IANA's policy on re-assigning previously assigned
port numbers is.  To my mind, permanently assigning numbers to
proprietary/commercial protocols is a bad idea as they are unlikely to
have long lifespans, but this is all obviously out of our hands.  So the
final port number may end up changing.  That's a shame, but it should be
an extremely easy fix to existing software.

I also don't know how the chicken-egg problem is usually resolved
whereby when applying for a port number registration from IANA you need
to give them a reference to a stable description of the protocol, but
obviously said stable description cannot, at that point in time, contain
the as-yet unassigned port number.  But obviously there is a way to
handle this, and we'll deal with it when the time comes.

&gt;<i> A more preeminent domain name, such as gemini.info, gemini.xyz or
</I>&gt;<i> something to host all of the above.
</I>
This is also something I'm planning.  Everything currently lives at
circumlunar.space because I already owned the domain and, in the early
days, it was not clear things would come as far as they have and that
buying a new domain was warranted.  Going forward, I would like a
clearer separation between these two projects.  Naturally, I'll maintain
permanent redirects for a substantial time after the change.

&gt;<i> Plus matching social media presence,
</I>&gt;<i> @gemini everywhere.
</I>
I have zero interest in running that myself, and don't really see enough
value in it to delegate that task to somebody else.  The most
enthusiastic uptake of Gemini has been people who I suspect have very
similar feelings.  It seems a poor cultural match.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
