&gt;<i> On what changes should actually be made, in my opinion the only
</I>&gt;<i> changes that should be made at this point should be to fix glaring
</I>&gt;<i> problems in the spec. I guess that creates another problem, because
</I>&gt;<i> people can't even agree what a &quot;glaring problem&quot; is!
</I>
The lack of any mention of IDN and IRI in the spec (and how to handle
them) is certainly a glaring problem. We are in 2020, we start a
completely new system, internationalization should not be an option.

&gt;<i> Solderpunk's been pretty reasonable, so I'll leave it up to them to
</I>&gt;<i> actually decide what's a problem and what's not,
</I>
The way, I understand it, Gemini's governance is basically &quot;Solderpunk
decides&quot;. This has good properties (it allows to keep the spec
consistent, and it avoids the committee effect) and bad ones, too
(when Solderpunk is busy with his relocation). But I agree that there
is no obvious alternative.

&gt;<i> As a second rule of thumb, I'd say no breaking changes, even if they
</I>&gt;<i> do fix a problem in the spec. Backwards compatibility is painful,
</I>
I disagree here. I don't think that backward compatibility should be a
goal.

* Gemini starts from zero, this is an opportunity (one of the
strengths of Gemini, when compared to, say, HTTP).

* Gemini has few users and most are passionnate enough to handle a few
changes.

* Gemini is simple so modifying the existing clients and servers would
not be too complicated.

&gt;<i> the 100% inclusive approach of creating a dedicated RFC listing.
</I>
This approach seems reasonable. This is what the christian church did,
after all, write a canon, a list of approved texts
