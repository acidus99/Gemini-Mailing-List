<PRE>Greetings Geminauts,

I recently heard from one of the developers of edbrowse (see
edbrowse.org), who said that he thought Gemini could be very popular
with disabled internet uses due to its potential for much better
accessibility than the web.  He is open to the idea of adding Gemini
support to edbrowse, but doesn't haven't the time to do it himself.
He suggested that if I or somebody else submitted a pull request doing
this, it could very well be adopted.  I also don't have time to do this
anytime soon, and my C is pretty rusty anyway.  If anybody else is
looking for a Gemini-related coding project and has good C skills, this
could be an excellent candidate.  It's also a good opportunity to bring
awareness of and access to Gemini to a large pre-existing userbase who
might find it very useful.

Edbrowse already supports gopher, and the gopher module is apparently
about 300 lines of C.  Gemini is in some ways simpler than Gopher and
other ways less simple; this job would perhaps involve writing ~500
lines of C or thereabouts.

Let me know if you are interested.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
