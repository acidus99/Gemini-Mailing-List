<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Sean Conner once stated:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Is anyone else getting slammed by 70.113.100.216?  Does anyone know who
</I>&gt;<i> this is?  I don't mind my server being used by clients as a test platform,
</I>&gt;<i> but making a few hundred requests per second is a bit much.  Also, a bunch
</I>&gt;<i> of bogus requests.
</I>
  Okay, I was able to track down the party responsible.  I won't go into how
I did, or who they are because I don't want anyone piling up on the party
responsible.  I sent a message to said party about the issues, and
hopefully, I should hear a resonse back, or at the very least, the issues
will be resolved silently.
