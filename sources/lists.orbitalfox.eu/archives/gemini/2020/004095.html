&gt;<i> I don't think this is going to be acceptable for authors.
</I>
Maybe not. I don&#8217;t really know.

&gt;<i> It's
</I>&gt;<i> unreasonable to ask authors to use a tool other than their favorite text
</I>&gt;<i> editor to write gemtext.
</I>
Is it? Unreasonable is a strong word here.

I assume there would be some servers out there that would do this on the fly when serving gemtext, but I can&#8217;t know that for sure. There could also be a CLI tool you can run on your file that fixes links. Or some other solution.

&gt;<i> Why is it reasonable for the client to have to
</I>&gt;<i> punycode the domain (an uncommon encoding for which not every common
</I>&gt;<i> language has a library),
</I>
I made the assumption that most languages dealing in stuff like URLs would have support for it. I may be in the wrong there. I also made the assumption that punycoding was common, but I may be in the wrong there too. Which method *is* common?

&gt;<i> but unreasonable for it to have to urlencode
</I>&gt;<i> the path (a common encoding for which libraries are ubiquitous)?
</I>
Because &#8212; as I tried to point out &#8212; there is no reasonably simple heuristic for determining whether a URL is already percent encoded or not. And percent encoding a URL that is already percent encoded exchanges all % characters with %25. Attempting to punycode a domain name that is already punycoded, however, changes nothing at all. No heuristics are needed, the client can just punycode everything.

&gt;<i> Why is
</I>&gt;<i> it so hard to convince people to just do the right thing?
</I>
Why are you so adamantly convinced that *you* are arguing for &#8221;the right thing&#8221;? Is there an objective measurement here that you may share with me?
