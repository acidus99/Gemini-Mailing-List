<PRE>Nah, I don't think JSON is always better. I like XML, I just personally
find JSON easier to work with. It's no longer tied to the JS ecosystem,
python, PHP, go and other languages all have support for it in their
respective stdlibs.

</I>&gt;<i> It explores the XML vs JSON debate in the most painstaking through

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Abstract
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We all know that XML is &quot;fat&quot; and JSON is the &quot;thinner&quot;, &quot;faster&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;smaller&quot;, &quot;better&quot; markup. We know this to be true because we've been
</I>&gt;<i> told it over and over. It's &quot;obvious&quot; and &quot;inherently true&quot; because XML
</I>&gt;<i> has redundant end tags, namespaces, entities and other extra &quot;pounds of
</I>&gt;<i> fat&quot; that JSON doesn't have. But where is the science supporting this?
</I>&gt;<i> What are the facts and what is myth? When people make design and
</I>&gt;<i> architecture decisions it should be supported by facts not speculation.
</I>&gt;<i> In this paper I show the results of an ongoing series of real world
</I>&gt;<i> tests of Markup performance in browsers across a wide variety of
</I>&gt;<i> devices, browsers and operating systems and attempt to quantify markup
</I>&gt;<i> performance with experimental results and maybe trim the fat myth one
</I>&gt;<i> calorie at a time.
