I think we're in the same boat, as I have written from scratch my server
using only stuff that's in base on OpenBSD too.

Initially I was totally for option #3 (but I've that I've just finished
skimming through the RFC), but by reading your messages I was a little
scared of the consequences.

Today I did some light testing, and it seems that (IF I'm understanding
everything correctly -- please correct me otherwise) that option #3 is
actually simpler for us.

Current state of the affairs: both Lagrange (0.13.1), amfora and elpher
will encode &quot;gemini.omarpolo.com/caf&#232;.gmi&quot; as
&quot;gemini.omarpolo.com/caf%C3%A8.gmi&quot;.  Obviously open(&quot;caf%C3%A8.gmi&quot;)
fails, so my server return 51 because the actual file name is
&quot;caf&#232;.gmi&quot;.  I have to write code that de-encode parts of the request if
I want to serve a file named like that (spoiler: I'm not gonna write it).

With IRI: the request becomes &quot;<A HREF="gemini://gemini.omarpolo.com/caf&#232;.gmi">gemini://gemini.omarpolo.com/caf&#232;.gmi</A>&quot;,
so open(&quot;caf&#232;.gmi&quot;) doesn't fail.  I think that we can continue to treat
the request as a bytestring, extract the path and try to open(2) it.

I know that what I'm proposing is a really poor-man solution, because it
doesn't matter we choose option #1, #2 or #3 as we can't really treat
the path in the URL/IRL as a bytestring and call it a day.  UNIX file
names are real bytestring with only two forbidden octet, URL/IRI
aren't.

So, if I'm not missing anything, I'm all in for option #3.
