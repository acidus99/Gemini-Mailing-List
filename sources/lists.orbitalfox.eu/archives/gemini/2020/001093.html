Thanks, I will have a read!
 
&gt;<i> Well, in the two party scenario, sending a CSR and sending a fingerprint

Sure, but in the fingerprint case the relevant runes just get sent as a
side-effect of an ordinary TLS transaction.

</I>
Ah, now *this* is definitely true.  At the start of this whole thing I
brushed off a lot of people's concerns about the complexity of TLS by
waving my hands and saying &quot;there are library bindings to do this in
every language&quot;.  I did not realise that so many of those libraries
would be so totally unable to handle anything even the slightest bit
unconventional.  It bothers me a bit now that fully implementing so many
of the ideas that I thought would make TLS a little bit less of an
imposition, or a little bit less offensive to radical decentralists,
looks like it will be quite a pain in some cases.  I never would have
imagined it would be literally impossible for a server using Python's
standard `ssl` module to accept a self-signed client certificate!
