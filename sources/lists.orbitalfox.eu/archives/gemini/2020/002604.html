<PRE>It is true that JSON usually resolves to an object, but that makes it a
bit more of a chore to deal with when using non-object-oriented
languages. I'm not sure why you had a difficult time writing XML
parsers, but it shouldn't be too different from something along the
lines of var = $root-&gt;array[n]-&gt;post;. I don't feel too strongly either
way, but I do feel that JSON being so much better than XML is largely
overhyped and while there are extreme edge-cases where some more
specialized interchange format could be more efficient than XML often
times there is just not that huge of a difference to warrant going in a
completely new direction and leaving behind decades of development into
XML based tools. To me the XML vs JSON argument is a lot like
bikeshedding, and I'd go with XML because it's what we already have and
doesn't have problems with non-javascript langs.

But if we really want to drag the XML vs JSON bikeshed all the way out,
might as well use an existing bikeshed blog than start up a new one.

This is linked to from XMPP.org myths &amp; legends
<A HREF="https://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol10/html/Lee01/BalisageVol10-Lee01.html">https://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol10/html/Lee01/BalisageVol10-Lee01.html</A>
It explores the XML vs JSON debate in the most painstaking through
detail.


Abstract

We all know that XML is &quot;fat&quot; and JSON is the &quot;thinner&quot;, &quot;faster&quot;,
&quot;smaller&quot;, &quot;better&quot; markup. We know this to be true because we've been
told it over and over. It's &quot;obvious&quot; and &quot;inherently true&quot; because XML
has redundant end tags, namespaces, entities and other extra &quot;pounds of
fat&quot; that JSON doesn't have. But where is the science supporting this?
What are the facts and what is myth? When people make design and
architecture decisions it should be supported by facts not speculation.
In this paper I show the results of an ongoing series of real world
tests of Markup performance in browsers across a wide variety of
devices, browsers and operating systems and attempt to quantify markup
performance with experimental results and maybe trim the fat myth one
calorie at a time.
