<PRE>Greetings Gemininauts!

I just wanted to wish a warm welcome to all the new subscribers to this
list who have discovered Gemini in the wake of our recent exposure on
Hacker News and Lobste.rs.  I realise this is slightly overdue, but
perhaps this is a nice introduction to the relatively relaxed pace of
development here in Geminiland!  Not that we are opposed to getting
stuff done, but we are still a small community of volunteers and the
typical pace matches that reality.

New energy and new ideas are very welcome, so please feel free to jump
in to the mailing list and the community more broadly.

Unsurprisingly, given that you are the kind of people who read Hacker
News, many of you have already started on Gemini-related software
projects.  This is welcome, please keep us informed about them.
However, Gemini is probably already setting new world records for the
ratio of software implementations to available content for an internet
protocol!  More important than anything else for the growth of the
community and the refinement of the protocol is *content*.  Good content
will encourage people to install clients, check the place out, and
spread the word.  Ambitious content creation projects help us figure out
what the protocol's strong and weak points are and can help make sure
any future changes are based on real world experience and not trying to
anticipate the future.

Any and all content is good, but Gemini-exclusive content is better, and
content that isn't *about* Gemini is best of all.  There's nothing wrong
with writing about the protocol - I do it myself, in a gemlog dedicated
to the subject - but we don't want to become an insular community which
only talks about itself.  Adoption of the protocol by newcomers will be
much more likely if there's stuff in Geminispace which is of value or
interest for people who don't already know much about it.

If you want to get started publishing content in Geminispace, anybody on
this mailing list can email me an ssh public key in order to get sftp
access to a user directory at gemini.circumlunar.space, where you can
host anything which doesn't get me into legal hot water or bring the
project as a whole into ill repute.  There are other places out there
offering user accounts, too - explore the list of known hosts at
<A HREF="gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/servers/.">gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/servers/.</A>  However, be aware that many
of these places are pre-existing communities who have started offering
Gemini hosting alongside other servicces (like gopher or web hosting,
email, shell-based BBSes, etc).  Don't be rude and join one of these
places just for the free Geminispace if you have no intention in
genuinely participating in their broader community!  If the idea of a
&quot;pubnix&quot; or &quot;tilde&quot; community is wholy new to you, I strongly encourage
you to check it out!  Many of the earliest and most active
participants in Geminispace &quot;come from&quot; one of these communities, and
they might offer some insight into the perspectives, attitudes and
ideals which are prominent in Geminispace.

That's all from me for now.  Welcome once again, thanks for your time
and interest and thus far wholly positive comments and contributions to
this fledgling slice of the internet.  I hope you stick around!

Cheers,
Solderpunk

</PRE>
