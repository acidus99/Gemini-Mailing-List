<PRE>I would say, generally, that the base directionality of text is given by the script one is using, which is defined by the language tag. A language has a default script (for en-US, that's Latin), and if someone wants to change their script, it's very easy to do so via the script part of the lang tag, for example, yi-US (which is shorthand for yi-Hebr-US, and is RTL) vs yi-Latn-US (LTR).

&gt;<i> Ahoy!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's pick this issue up again, in its own thread this time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My original proposal was that we add a new parameter to the text/gemini
</I>&gt;<i> media type to specify the human language a document is written in.
</I>&gt;<i> Following the lead of RFC1766, the parameter would be called &quot;lang&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> take values based on ISO 639 language codes and ISO 3166 country codes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I recall, nobody actually objected to this as something we
</I>&gt;<i> should do in principle, instead we just got distracted by various edge
</I>&gt;<i> cases. But I guess I may as well ask now: does anybody think this is a
</I>&gt;<i> *bad* idea?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The two concerete motivations for adding this were:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Screenreaders need to know this information to know which settings to
</I>&gt;<i> use for their text-to-speech engine: the same letters correspond to
</I>&gt;<i> different sounds in different languages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Search engines may want to to offer their users the ability to ask
</I>&gt;<i> for results only in a particular set of languages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can anybody think of additional likey use cases besides these?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since these are the main motivations, that also means that &quot;normal
</I>&gt;<i> clients&quot; (i.e. for use by sighted human users) have minimal use for this
</I>&gt;<i> information and can more or less ignore it. So, in considering the edge
</I>&gt;<i> cases that came up, we should be thinking about screenreaders and search
</I>&gt;<i> engines, not the stuff that most people here are presumably using day to
</I>&gt;<i> day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first question was what to do if the parameter is not specified.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was, and am, opposed to putting a default language in the spec.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of a screenreader, it seems entirely sensible to me that the
</I>&gt;<i> user of any such screenreader should be able to specify their own
</I>&gt;<i> default based on their primary reading languages, and that the software
</I>&gt;<i> should make it easy to change this when it is clear there is a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> It's not really the Gemini spec's job to say anything about this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The case of search engines is trickier, since their resulting database
</I>&gt;<i> does not have just one user but many. This was where autodetection
</I>&gt;<i> first came up, which some people seemed to get carried away with. Fully
</I>&gt;<i> generalised autodetection of language is computationally expensive and
</I>&gt;<i> it gives answers with some uncertainty. A large search engine project
</I>&gt;<i> *may* want to think about it - the idea of clients for humans users
</I>&gt;<i> doing it as a routine response to a lack of a lang parameter is nuts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A simpler option for search engines might simply be to interpret a user
</I>&gt;<i> request of &quot;only show me results in languages X&quot; as &quot;don't show results
</I>&gt;<i> *known* to be in languages other than X&quot;. i.e documents for which the
</I>&gt;<i> language is not known are always possible search results. This is
</I>&gt;<i> imperfect, but, well, sometimes life is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short, I am not sure that the lack of specified default behaviour is
</I>&gt;<i> a good reason not to go ahead with this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second question was what to do when a document contains text in
</I>&gt;<i> multiple languages. This is a trickier question. I'd prefer not to
</I>&gt;<i> define a new line type to handle it. We could at least allow the lang
</I>&gt;<i> parameter to accept multiple values separated by some delimiter. It
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't be clear from that which parts were what, but it could at least
</I>&gt;<i> act as a strong hint to screenreaders. Search engines could include
</I>&gt;<i> such pages in results if any of the delcared languages matched one the
</I>&gt;<i> user had requested. Actually, perhaps that's a perfectly adequate
</I>&gt;<i> solution, in which case this is not trickier at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's also the question of directionality, which I think might require
</I>&gt;<i> a separate parameter entirely. But let's focus on the language thing
</I>&gt;<i> for now. How does the above sound to people?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Solderpunk
