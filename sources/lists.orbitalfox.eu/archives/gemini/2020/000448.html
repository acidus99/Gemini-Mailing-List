Welcome, glad you like the goals of the project!

I had actually been planning to make a spec change this weekend, which
would add to the text/gemini definition the verbatim text block idea
(since nobody spoke out strongly, or even weakly, in opposition to it
after my last email on the subject) as well as a *subset* of the
strictly optional extra features we discussed, including e.g. headings
beginning with # and non-nested unordered lists with *, both as per
CommonMark.

Further, after making that change I plan to decree &quot;absolutely no spec
changes for at least six months (or maybe three, let's see how extreme
I'm feeling on Sunday), unless some kind of horrible serious problem is
discovered (I can't imagine what that could be)&quot;.  I don't even want to
seriously *discuss* possible spec changes for that long.

The reason for this is that we are operating far too much in a vacuum.
There is still very little original content in Geminispace, and even
less of it which isn't *about* Gemini.  There are plenty of features in
the current spec which nobody has used yet, as far as I know, or have
not been used for anything other than fun little tests.  We have
multiple server implementations, multiple client implementations and
now even a search engine!  I have offered free Geminispace at
gemini.circumlunar.space to anybody who wants it.  It is high time for
us to actually build stuff with what we have achieved so far.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
