<PRE>The list of possible server software at
&lt;<A HREF="gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/software/">gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/software/</A>&gt; does not provide any
details about their status, their features, their strengths and
weaknesses. Choosing software for a server is therefore a long and
tedious task.

Is there a better list somewhere? I think that, for Gemini deployment,
it would be better to have it, since newbies sysadmins may be
discouraged by the very differente states of maturity of programs in
the current list. After my (very incomplete) tests, I find that:

* Agate : Static files. Works OK but not way to set the lang.
* Shavit : bind IP address hardwired as localhost.
* Blizanci : no commit in the last six months
* GeGoBi : seems only suitable for people who already have a Gopher
  server and want to serve with Gemini immediately
* Geminid : written in C, which scares me. There are so many ways to
  be wrong when programming an Internet server in C. Otherwise, works
  OK. No commit in the last five months.
* Gemserv : Works OK and has vhosts. Seems cool. It fails with error 31 when the URI
  has no trailing / unlike other servers. 
* Molly-brown : perfect in everything (but no vhosts)
* Net-gemini : not a server but a library to develop custom servers,
  for instance with CGI, it seems.
* Northstar : the same
* Pollux : apparently very limited, can serve only one file.  no
  commit in the last six months
* Twins : Works OK. Very feature-rich. But no way to set the language in the
  answers?
