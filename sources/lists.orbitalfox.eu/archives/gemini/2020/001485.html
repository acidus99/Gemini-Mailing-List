</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I just didn't see a compelling reason to add it.
</I>
  I think it may have something to do with Apache's rewrite rules.  My blog
[1] is run via a CGI script, and I make extensive use of it to hide the fact
that I'm using a CGI script [2].  For example, the url:

	<A HREF="http://boston.conman.org/about/technical.html">http://boston.conman.org/about/technical.html</A>

is routed through the following rewrite rule [3]:

	RewriteRule ^about/(.*) boston.cgi/about/$1 [L]

to give the final (internal) path of:

	/boston.cgi/about/technical.html

  I then use PATH_TRANSLATED to find the actual file to display.  No Gemini
server supports rewriting rules, but I don't see a reason why one couldn't.

&gt;<i> &gt; and it always sets TLS_CIPHER and TLS_VERSION.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why not? These are just as useful even if the client doesn't send a
</I>&gt;<i> certificate.
</I>
  Fair enough.

&gt;<i> Some other differences in my server's CGI implementation (I used GLV as a
</I>&gt;<i> reference implementation, so there are a lot of similarities too):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> TLS_CLIENT_HASH
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm using a base64-encoded representation of the hash. I like your notation of
</I>&gt;<i> SHA256:&lt;HEX&gt; better, but it's too late now and I don't want to break backwards
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility.
</I>
  The format I use is from libtls---it was not my choice.  

&gt;<i> TLS_CLIENT_SERIAL_NUMBER
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The client certificate serial number. I'm surprised that this isn't available
</I>&gt;<i> in libtls.
</I>
  I'm surprised too when I saw TLS_CLIENT_SERIAL_NUMBER for the first time. 
I may have to make an extention module to do some stuff that libtls can't
do.

&gt;<i> TLS_CLIENT_AUTHORISED
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even though jetforce accepts unverified client certificates now, it will still
</I>&gt;<i> check if the certificate is authorised anyway. This means both valid and trusted
</I>&gt;<i> by the server's CA store. So this will be set to &quot;1&quot; for trusted and &quot;0&quot; for
</I>&gt;<i> untrusted. I like this variable because it gives each CGI script the option to
</I>&gt;<i> implement authentication however they want.
</I>
  That makes sense.  That's another thing that libtls makes a bit difficult.

[2]	Not for security reasons, but for aesthetic reasons.  I could change
	the name of the CGI script and *none* of the URLs will change.

[3]	I'd have to look up what the '[L]' does---it's been *that* long
	since I've set this up.
