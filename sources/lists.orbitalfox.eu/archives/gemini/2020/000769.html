<PRE>&gt;<i> Wouldn't it be better to have a mail server scripted to write the mails
</I>&gt;<i> into files instead of a scraper? It would be almost real-time.
</I>
It might be. However, I know nothing about mail servers and do not wish to wade into those
waters at present. If you'd like to build it I would definitely love to check out the code and
visit the resulting gemini capsule :)

&gt;<i> ~5 minutes are better than 6 hours IMO.
</I>
The 6 hours was due to it being run on a resource limited system that is shared by other users.
However, now that it is caught up with the more than 400 messages for 2020, it uses up a lot
less processing time and memory to just keep up with the current posts. I have updated the 
CRON job to every 20 minutes.

My thought is that the gemini version is meant to be read as a digest a time or two a day. Not to
be constantly refreshed for new updates. At elast, that is the use case I built it for.

&gt;<i> Just throwing out ideas, feel free to say no :)
</I>
I genuinely appreciate the ideas! I had not thought of the mailserver route. As said above, it isnt
an area I know about so will likely not pursue... but it IS very interesting and could be a really
cool way to build something similar. While it isnt 5 minutes, I hope the 20 minute interval works
out better for you (and everyone).


It seems the server that I host through was down for a bit this morning (what may be afternoon
for many of you). It seems to be back up and cmccabe (the server admin) and I have been in touch
re: what happened. It seems there was a minor bug in the server code that has hopefully been
fixed. So if you didnt get a chance to check it out and wanted to, you should be able to now:
