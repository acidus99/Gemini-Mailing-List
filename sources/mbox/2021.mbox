Cool! I'm not sure what it is about the software behind those proxies 
that makes them unsuited for personal use, though.

Another similar project worth checking out is Kineto, another Golang 
HTTP-to-Gemini proxy designed to make a single Gemini capsule available 
over HTTP.

This is low priority for [spec] but we should rephrase parts of the
appendix before finalizing.

It's like you wrote.

While the appendix still refers to single-digit codes*, meaning the first
digit of the two digit code, the server still needs to send at least a
filler zero as the second digit in a minimal server.

The client can still ignore the second digit if it wants to.

*) This might need some improvement in the phrasing of the spec. Referring
to a code with two digits, where one of them is a filler, as a
"single-digit code" is confusing if you don't know the history of the
protocol.

Hey, that one is mine.

Indeed I use STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLS_SERVER which means any TLS version. I can switch to STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_2_SERVER but I was afraid this would forbid TLS 1.3.
I see a STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_3_SERVER in the PHP code but not in the documentation :-(
Which means I need to investigate PHP git history to check when this constant was added and whether I can use it as-is.

Relevant part of my code: gemini://code.lanterne.chilliet.eu/vendor/mcmic/gemini-server/src/Server.php (A fragment here would be handy to point the exact line, but I think no gemini clients support fragments? Here it?s not even text/plain but text/x-php so not sure what should be used?)

Because of this privacy issue, I think browsers should only send client certificates over TLS 1.3 (and newer).  This could be part of the spec.

We could also make a coordinated effort to help Gemini software support TLS 1.3 - reach out, send patches, see what's holding developers back.  Currently LibreSSL, GnuTLS and wolfSSL all support TLS 1.3, so most (if not all) browsers/servers/proxies/crawlers could probably make the upgrade.  Once enough software supports 1.3 and enough servers have switched, the minimum TLS version can be changed in the spec.

SNI-based surveillance is automatable, making it trivial for third parties to hoard this data at nearly no cost.  Even a tiny bit of non-automated work, like what you just did, will deter many (mostly commercial) actors involved in mass surveillance, for whom scalability is what makes it worthwhile.  When it comes to targeted surveillance done by state actors, ESNI won't help much (if at all), but this threat model doesn't apply to most people.  Let's not fall for the perfect solution fallacy.

Looks like ESNI is being superseded by Encrypted Client Hello (ECH):

Subject: [announce] Gemini in 2021
Message-ID: <C880SZPDV6WV.A42JINR2EOJJ@stilgar>

Happy New Year, Geminauts!

This seems like a good opportunity to make the maiden post to the
[announce] topic.

None of you need to be reminded that 2020 was an eventful and unusual
year, and the situation was no different in Geminispace!  While
obviously a new internet protocol of deliberately humble scope is not
remotely as important as the other issues which defined last year, at
least there was one small part of our lives where the events of 2020
were, on the whole, very positive.

At the start of the year, Gemini was around six months old and still a
fairly small and quiet project.  But starting around May we hit Hacker
News and other high profile social sites multiple times, resulting in an
explosive growth of interest in and discussion about the protocol.  Not
all of it was positive, but nevertheless by the year's end the ecosystem
had expanded significantly.  Many new software implementations, servers,
services and users joined this fledgling space in 2020, and there are no
signs of this growth slowing down.  It's been tremendously gratifying
for me to see so many people embrace the ideas and philosophy of Gemini.
The project has grown larger than I ever expected, faster than I ever
expected.  Lots of people have written me very kind emails of thanks,
saying that the internet feels more fun for them than it has in decades,
and each one has made me very happy.

This success has been a bit of a double-edged sword, though.  The
demands on my time and attention as Benevolent Dictator of the project
have grown beyond what's sustainable, and the model of using a single,
unmoderated mailing list as a venue for any and all discussion of all
aspects of the project is really starting to strain at the edges.  I am
hoping to make a number of changes to the project early in 2021 to
provide some much needed relief to the entire community, and I'd like
to roughly outline my plans in this email.

On the technical side, the protocol specification is rapidly moving
toward a stage where there are no further major changes or
clarifications to make.  I hope that sometime this month it will be
possible to effectively finalise the current "speculative specification"
document.  At this point, the [spec] topic of the mailing list will be
retired, and the project will transition to a new phase where the
primary ongoing technical activity is to translate that speculative
specification into a more precise and formal technical document, with
the goal that it might eventually be submitted to formal internet
standard organisations like IETF and IANA.

This translation process is important, but not, I would argue, urgent or
even terribly interesting for most people involved in Gemini more
broadly.  Protocol specifications *should* be precise and formal, but
what we have currently is, empirically speaking, clearly good enough to
facilitate reliable inter-operability between implementations.  Gemini
has an astonishing breadth of client and server implementations for such
a young protocol, with clients available for every major platform,
including mobile devices, and at least in my experience everything works
together very nicely indeed.  We should be very proud of this
accomplishment!  It shouldn't be necessary for anybody but the most
interested of hardcore protocol geeks to follow the translation process
closely while it happens.  From the point of view of most developers,
the project should be considered more or less "done" very soon.

I don't yet know exactly how the translation process will happen.  I
certainly don't want to do it alone, and I expect I will gladly delegate
a lot of the work, while still remaining involved.  I want the process
to be publically visible, but not necessarily open to unbounded public
participation, like the initial design of the protocol was.  Very little
actual technical decision making should be involved in this translation
process.  If the attempt to formalise the specification reveals
additional small inconsistencies or ambiguities, these will be resolved
with the smallest possible changes and with concern for compatibility
with existing practices.

If you have previous experience working with IETF and/or IANA and you
feel like you might like to be involved in some stage of this process,
please feel free to reach out to me off-list.

On a more community-oriented note, I would also like to overhaul the
project's public face and delegate some of the responsibility of
managing it.  I plan to transition the project to a new domain this
year, rather than stick with gemini.circumlunar.space.  That domain was
only used because I already owned circumlunar.space for other purposes.
I would like to separate the two projects more, and give Gemini an
easier to remember domain which is more closely tied to its own
identity.  Naturally I will maintain redirects from the old domain for
a long time - this is exactly what redirects in Gemini were intended to
allow.  It would be great if exactly the same information was available
simultaneously over Gopher, Gemini and HTTPS, if this information was
better organised and curated than it is currently, and if documents
like the FAQ were translated into other languages.  It would be great if
there was an easier way for people to submit or suggest changes,
corrections, translations, etc. than sending email to a single point of
contact.

I don't, frankly, really know what the easiest way to achieve this is.
If you have ideas, and especially if you are willing to donate time or
resources to help, feel free to reach out to me off-list.  I would very
much like the solution not to involve any commercial services, such as
GitHub, and naturally the HTTPS version of the site should be totally
free of cookies, Javascript, analytics, etc.  Probably it should just be
derived directly from the Gemini version of the site using a tool like
Kineto (https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/kineto/).  I don't mind at all if the
styling of the site is something a little "nicer" than what's there now,
as long as it remains clean, uncluttered, accessible and consists of a
single short stylesheet, and once the new framework is in place I am
happy for people who want to volunteer a design to reach out to me to do
so.

Obviously, having any kind of control over the project's public sites is
a high-trust position and I'd be much happier delegating this to
somebody with whom I've already had some interaction in the past and who
has displayed some clear commitment to the project.

If you'd like to volunteer to translate the FAQ or Best Practices
document into another language, please reach out to me off-list.  I'm
happy to start including these translations in the current version of
the site even before the transition to whatever new approach hopefully
emerges.

If you'd like to volunteer to play some role in moderating the mailing
list to help make it more a welcoming and civil place in the future,
please feel free to reach out to me off-list.  I don't know yet whether
this might involve actually assigning some degree of admin rights to
people or just having people keep a close eye on things and alert me if
they think things are getting out of hand.  But something will need to
be put in place, as I personally absolutely cannot maintain an
indefinite close eye on the entire list.

While I've outlined a lot of changes and work for the project's official
public presence, I also want to emphasise my belief that as Geminispace
continues to grow larger and faster, and as the protocol moves toward
technically maturity, there is actually less and less need for a single,
central, official public presence, and that the realistic scope of such
a presence becomes smaller and smaller.  Neither the web nor Gopher have
any such presence.  That's not to say there isn't material available
over either protocol to introduce newcomers, explain the protocol's
technical or philosophical underpinnings or point people toward popular
and/or new content.  Instead, that important content is distributed
across many locations and is produced and maintained by the community at
large.  I see no reason that Gemini should be any different.  Obviously
we're not quite at the same stage as either of those protocols, but
still, I expect that by the end of 2021 the official site will have
moved into a fairly static state, and continued community-building
activities will take place elsewhere.

Finally, I want to say a big thank you to every single person who played
a role large or small in 2020 in helping to spread awareness of Gemini,
in steering the design of the protocol, in writing software of any kind,
in setting up servers or, most importantly of all, in writing content.
We have come a long way in a short time and I look forward to us
maintaining this energy in the new year.

Cheers!

Message-ID: <C88C7UH9R0RZ.1J3ZMHTR199TE@tilde>

Hello,

Just recently I was creating a Gemini mirror of an HTTP site, and came
across several pages that made heavy use of tables. I did what I suspect
most Gemini publishers/content authors do: use ASCII tables, like so:

+--------------------------------+-------+
| Food                           | Price |
+--------------------------------+-------+
| Eggs                           | $2    |
| Eggs and spam                  | $4    |
| Eggs, spam, eggs and spam      | $8    |
| Spam spam baked beans and spam | $8    |
| Just spam                      | $2    |
+--------------------------------+-------+

There are several problems with this approach, though:

1. It requires the client to display the table in a monospaced font,
   which many would prefer not to use.
2. Text in table rows won't be wrapped properly on narrow displays.
3. ASCII tables are anything but screenreader friendly, since there's no
   semantic information about the table's structure.
4. It mixes information and presentation, which is against the spirit of
   Gemini(?)

So, are there any other options for having tables in Gemtext, other than
adding a new syntax to the spec? I'm hard pressed to think of another
solution.

Regards,

If you put your table in a preformatted block, then a monospaced font and not
wrapping are required by the spec, and so are a non-issue. All the tables I've
seen are in preformatted blocks, and I would consider anyone not doing that to
be making a mistake, for the very reasons you've written above.

> 3.  ASCII tables are anything but screenreader friendly, since there's no

Yes, that's the main problem in my opinion. I don't see a great solution really.
Perhaps if the word table is in the alt text (an unofficial idea, which is the
text right after the first backtick line), a really good client could interpret
where the cells are and read them? It would be error-prone of course, and still
not very accessible.

> 4.  It mixes information and presentation, which is against the spirit of
>     Gemini(?)

The point of preformatted blocks is to control presentation in the specific
cases where it's needed, like code, ASCII art, or I guess tables. While in
general you're right, I think there is sort of a "precedent" for this mixing.

> So, are there any other options for having tables in Gemtext

You could create a CSV or HTML file and link to it? Other than that I'm not sure,
I don't see an easy solution to this.

> adding a new syntax to the spec

I doubt this will happen, gemtext is pretty set right now. And the ability to
parse tables would go against its idea of clients only needing to look at the
first three characters.

Yes, that's the point. If I have my client configured to use a
variable-width
font, I don't think I'd enjoy having just tables being in a monospace
font.

Just for the record, this was not what I was advocating.

Not necessarily. Something like scdoc's [0] table syntax [1] could be
used:

=[ Foo
=: Bar
=:
=| Row 1
=: Hello
=: world!
=| Row 2
=: Hello
=: universe!

Unfortunately, such a solution means that the table syntax would be
unreadable without further processing, which is also against the spirit
of Gemtext(?)

Anyways. Back to ASCII art, I suppose.

  There's not much choice you have in this matter.  I use preformatted
blocks for HTML tables, you can see two examples of which here:

  The format I use works because I only use HTML tables for actual tabular
data and *not* for layout purposes.  The output uses tabs (HT, or character
9) between each field.  The <caption> becomes the first line; the <thead>
(table header) is followed by a line of dashes; any <tfoot> section will
appear at the bottom of the table, again separated by dashes.

  I don't bother with any further decorations (like you have) because I
don't feel its necessary (and if a cut-n-paste keeps the tab characters, it
becomes rather easy to manipulate the data).

Unofficial? It's in section "5.4.3 Preformatting toggle lines" in the spec.

The proper way to use alt text in this case is to describe the information
in the table as if you are talking to someone on the phone, essentially
duplicating the information in prose. This can get tedious in big tables.

For simple two column tables, you could replace them with lists.

FWIW org-mode (a  software for Emacs) deals very well  with table like
you  wrote in  your message  (navigation, narrowing,  it even  include
spreadsheet features!). :)

So i guess a sufficiently smart client ;-) could parse and manage text
table very well! :)

That's true. But that would work only if there was some consensus on how
such ASCII tables are to be formatted, then. We can't reasonably expect
even the smartest of clients to be able to parse the myriad of different
table styles in use today :^)

Some other ideas:

If you want to present the information in its original structure, there 
are other options
(as well as trying to inline it into gemtext preformatted text already 
discussed on this thread):

1. provide link to a CSV
2. serialise as simple text
3. If you just want to preserve the visual appearance, you could also 
provide a link to a rendered PDF

For option 2, most tables can be "flattened" in a way that users can 
usually get the idea of that was there. In my own html2gmi app [1] it 
has this as an option for processing tables as well as the "preformatted 
text layout":

? table ?

Food Price
Eggs $2
Eggs and spam  $4
Eggs, spam, eggs and spam $8
Spam spam baked beans and spam $8
Just spam $2

Works fine for your table above IMHO. Or you could use some similar 
variant approach of this.

I grant you this won't help for complex tables, but for those your 
options are limited apart from option 1 and 3 if you want to keep the 
full original appearance or structure.

Subject: [spec] Possible Tables Syntax
Message-ID: <3KHVG29MYIBIK.3FEH0KE8P0LMU@nothien.uber.space>

There is a new discussion about table formats under the [users]
category, but I've thought of one possibility that roughly matches the
look of tables but keeps each cell on its own line, and I wanted to see
what others think of it in a more [spec]-relevant area.  Essentially,
indentation (tabs) is used to represent which column a cell is in.
Wrapping cell text is possible, so I hesitate to put it in a
preformatted block, but it's the best way to show that it's an
unfamiliar format.

```table
Food
	Price
Eggs
	$2
Eggs and spam
	$4
Eggs, spam, eggs and spam
	$8
Spam spam baked beans and spam
	$8
Just spam
	$2
```

It needs to be tried out a lot more to see how flexible it really is,
but it looks promising to me.  It looks quite structured visually, and
should be very easy to parse programmatically as well.  Of course, it
would be more difficult to visualize with more columns and longer cell
texts, but it's (much) better than nothing.

Each cell is on a different block, and the general expectation is that
the indentation level increases by one horizontal tab for every next
column, then resetting to no indentation for the next row.  We could
probably give specific interpretation to other possible things that
happen (e.g. 'jumps' in indentation level which are not resetting to
rows), or we could outright ban them, but I would prefer the former (as
then there is no room for extension).

I know that we're looking to finalize the spec, and that this will
probably not make it in (even if it gets accepted).  Tables are quite
uncommon, after all, so I don't there would be a big enough push to
warrant making it official.  But I argue that tables are a very
difficult thing to format to satisfy both humans and computers, so at
the minimum we would add this (or any agreed-upon table format) to the
best practices document.  The best-case scenario to me is that it gets
added to the gemtext spec as an optional type to parse, similar to how
one would parse other preformatted blocks (but with more state to keep
track of).

What do you think?

Wikipedia lists many lightweight markup languages like AsciiDoc, MarkDown, 
Textile, Org-mode, reStructuredText. Not all, but many do support tables.

Not sure if there's a format that many client developers would be 
interested to support natively. Using WebKit to render an HTML 
transformation sounds a bit far off for Gemini to me, although e.g. 
ShowDown seems like a nice MarkDown viewer without being a web browser.

I would not support this as a proposal for client developers to 
implement. Gemtext is designed how it is, limitations and all, for a 
reason. If all clients implemented, say, markdown or restructuredtext, 
that would add an incredible extra load to what clients had to do. 
Gemtext is gemtext. If you don't like gemtext you can serve up something 
else, but don't expect clients to handle it well.
Regarding tables specifically, I don't see what's wrong with just using 
preformatted text, but that is a personal view.

Yes, it's grand the way it is; I enjoy its reduced capacity.

I guess clients seeing text/markdown will already offer to download the 
resource and the OS might offer to display the content in ShowDown or 
whatever ? likewise CSV/TSV and PDF, as others mentioned earlier 
regarding tables or documents containing tables and more.

We should try to use what we have before designing a new gemtext feature.

Lagrange provides a way to create scripts which handle MIME types lagrange
which are not supported by lagrange natively. We can use this to render CSV:

~/.config/lagrange/mimehooks.txt:

	CSV tables
	text/csv
	/bin/sh;/home/user/bin/csv2txt

~/bin/csv2txt:

	#!/bin/sh
	printf "20 text/plain\r\n"
	/bin/column -s, -t

Don't forget to make this script executable. Now, test how well it works:

gemini://gempaper.strangled.net/experiments/ubuntu-versions.csv

picture: https://ttm.sh/dvO.png

This is obviously not optimal:

* there are no cell borders (can be fixed easily)
* wide tables will overflow the border to the right (can be fixed in the
  client)
* if you link to a csv file, clicking on it will open it in a new
  frame, not inside the text like images (lagrange specific feature,
  can be fixed)
* only lagrange supports MIME hooks (can we improve this?)

But also has many advantages:

* embraces an existing format
* doesn't require anything special in gemtext
* even big tables can work
* if some clients choose to support CSV natively, they can do fancy
  tricks like sorting by columns

Greetings,

I?d like to announce my own take on a Gemini server implementation, which I?ve named Doppio.

https://github.com/bhavanki/doppio/

I implemented it in Java as a fun side coding project, but I hope it?s useful for others. It supports the usual good stuff:

* static files, including finding index files
* CGI with most meta-variables from RFC 3875, plus a bunch from Apache mod_ssl
* MIME type detection by file name suffix (.gmi or .gemini for text/gemini)
* access logging
* single server configuration file

It mostly passes gemini-diagnostics. :) There?s always more TLS work to do.

The server is licensed with AGPL 3.

Enjoy, and thanks!

  For CGI support, I set the REQUEST_METHOD to "" (since RFC-3875 madates
it---others have set it to "GET"), and instead of the Apache variables for
TLS, I used:

        TLS_CLIENT_NOT_AFTER
        TLS_CLIENT_REMAIN

and I think others that support CGI have done similar.  I like that you used
"Certificate" for AUTH_TYPE (as I have done) and the subject name for
REMOTE_USER (as most others have done).  I also added the following:

	GEMINI_DOCUMENT_ROOT
	GEMINI_SCRIPT_FILENAME
	GEMINI_URL_PATH
	GEMINI_URL

and again, some others support some of the above.  Sadly, the CGI
discussions seem to die out quickly on this list.

  Anyway, nice job.

support. If the goal is machine readability, choose a format which is
already supported by numerous software.

In particular I think it's a bad idea to introduce something like this
as an optional recommended best practice. Either go all in, or what
looks like a table in one client will look nothing like a table in
another.

My suggested solution: if you really need an in-line human readable
table, lay it out in a preformatted block such that it makes sense to a
user with a client that interprets and displays preformatted blocks as
preformatted blocks. If you need the same data to be available machine
readable, link to a corresponding CSV/TSV/*SV below.

Yes, I agree, the container format (```table```) is bad.  I was more
interested in the actual format - but we can definitely change the
containing layout.  Do you have any suggestions?

The issue is that none of the other table formats I've seen are both
human readable and easily machine parsable.  This one is.

There are two issues with going 'all in' (which I understand as making
it a proper part of the gemtext part of the spec): firstly, that clients
will treat it as a must-have, which it isn't (it's pretty readable
without any fancy rendering), and secondly that the spec is almost
finalized right now, and I don't see it making it in (because of how
rarely it comes up).  I did mention this as a best case scenario, but
your last point is why I've introduced this idea at all - to prevent the
aggregation of multiple different supported table formats.

Well, with my format, you can have both.  Of course, even slighly large
tables can and should be kept in CSV or similar, but this works well for
small tables which may be modified often.  The issue with a fully laid
out table in a preformatted block is 1) that it's getting into
presentation (different users will create different looking tables,
adding style as they see fit, but that's against the general gemtext
philosophy), and 2) that it's difficult to modify cells without having
to adjust the entire table.  My format is affected by neither, because
all the table control is done via whitespace (and one can't style HTs
and LFs), and because cells are on individual lines which are much
easier to move around or to add to.

Sounds like an opinion, but then so is mine.  I'm using (Neo)Vi(m),
where whether HTs or spaces are inserted depends upon the format, but is
easily changeable (:set [no]expandtab or :set [no]et).  I don't actually
know about many other editors.  Do you have any data to back this up?
I'll go looking myself as well, but if it turns out that HTs are
uncommon then we may be able to replace them with 4 spaces (of course,
that opens up the question of what happens when the number of spaces on
a table line is not a multiple of 4, but we can figure that out).

This opinion requires some elaboration. There is no reason to choose paths
rather than queries, both are part of the URL. The difference between
the two is purely historical (at a time, ? indicated a dynamic page).

Said otherwise, <gemini://capsule.example/foo/bar> or
<gemini://capsule.example/foo?bar> have identical semantics. A Gemini
client can deduce nothing from the fact that one uses a path and the
other a query.

Note that Amazon managed to *patent* the idea of using parameters in
the path. US "land of the crazy parents" patent n? 7,287,042

Not right. RFC 5891, the standard for IDN, states that "By the time a
string enters the IDNA registration process as described in this
specification, it MUST be in Unicode and in Normalization Form C (NFC
[Unicode-UAX15])." So, at least the hostname has no problem.

This is because it includes a lot of text/plain. I've just modified
the stats at <gemini://gemini.bortzmeyer.org/software/lupa/stats.gmi>
to have a special tally for text/gemini and UTF-8 has a
quasi-monopoly.

Note also that saying "gemtexts MUST be in UTF-8" is not
everything. We may (or may be not) also want to mandate end-of-lines
(they can be represented with CR, LF, CR-LF, LS or PS, the last two
being purely Unicode, not present in ASCII) and normalization.

If we go that way, there is an existing standard for Unicode text, RFC
5198 <gemini://gemini.bortzmeyer.org/rfc-mirror/rfc5198.txt>. It
mandates CR-LF and normalization NFC.

This is not true. As Michael said, URI are bytes, not characters. The
encoding is anyone's guess.

Two details:

* paths (not just queries) can contain any binary garbage but there
are special rules for hostnames.

* the RFC has provisions for "a new URI scheme" which may apply to
us. We can decide here that URI of scheme "gemini" MUST be entirely in
UTF-8.

And yet it moves.

And no, it's not "anyone's guess", it's de facto in UTF-8.

First of all, **Hello**, as it's my first message here.
I like the original idea to some extent. It bothers me, that what is meant
to be a row doesn't actually lay in one line. I immediately wanted to
propose usage of TSVs as they are pretty human readable and have a good
support in many text parsers. I don't want explicit support for tables, but
rather making TSV inside a preformatted block a *best practice* for
presenting data of tabular form. Fancy clients could have support for a
technique of HT rendering known as [elastic
tabstops](https://nickgravgaard.com/elastic-tabstops/) (tl;dr render tabs in
blocks of neighboring lines to the same stop point, widening ones that are
too short, if needed). But then simple terminal-based clients aiming to
benefit from one-scan-to-render feature of text/gemini would suffer with all
the usual problems we know from attempts to display TSV in the terminal.

Example data (pure TSV):
```
Name	Age	Address
Paul	23	1115 W Franklin
Bessy the Cow	5	Big Farm Way
Zeke	45	W Main St
```

Elastically rendered (using more tabs here, for illustration):
```
Name			Age	Address
Paul			23	1115 W Franklin
Bessy the Cow		5	Big Farm Way
Zeke			45	W Main St
```

Solution could be to implement elastic tabstops in a greedy manner (align to
the widest cell so-far). I think that greedy renderer is a good midpoint
between naive aligning to nearest multiples of 4 (or 8 or whatever) and full
elastic tabstops rendering. With this we could encourage users to make a
table header containing cells of maximum needed length (for example by
padding the remaining width with spaces). Obvious flaw of this solution is
requiring text author to know the maximum widths of their columns (which can
potentially be big raw data impossible to look up). But then TSV will look
like table no matter what.

Greedy/semi elastic render (without padded header) (`Name` column made wider
after encountering Bessy the Cow cell):
```
Name	Age	Address
Paul	23	1115 W Franklin
Bessy the Cow		5	Big Farm Way
Zeke			45	W Main St
```
Now that I think about it, this has little to nothing to do with spec (maybe
I should send it to [tech] as well, or instead) as all of this can be put in
best practices or even emerge as non-written standard for
formulating/rendering documents. However, I think this is an interesting use
of an uncommon text rendering technique to make plaintext capable of
presenting tabular data. Let me know, what you think about that.

This is one of the weaknesses of the current spec (and why I think it
is far from finished). Using a CA like Let's Encrypt is not forbidden
but there is no detail about how it goes with TOFU. For instance, when
a certificate (or key?) changes, is it TOFU-OK if it is signed by a
recognized CA?

Right you are.  

Formalism,  good editing, and brevity will help tremendously. The specification has to be precise, not meandering.

Message-ID: <20210103154905.GA8908@sources.org>

This is to announce the Agunua library, to help Python developers
write Gemini clients. Agunua is used in the Manisha monitoring tool
(to watch your capsule) and in the Lupa crawler. There is also a
standalone command-line client, a bit like the thousand other
curl-like programs existing for Gemini :-)

Among the features that are not always present in similar tools:

* IDN and IRI support (remember this is not standardized yet),
* Ability to parse links and return them (useful when writing a
  crawler),
* Full control of security: certificate validation or not, TOFU or
  not, accept expired certificates or not.

Not quite.

For text/gemini, your stats read:

? Unspecified: 42,322
? utf-8: 6,513
? us-ascii: 3

Unspecified rules. By far. Most likely plain ASCII in practice.


Could you run #file --mime-type --mime-encoding on all these text/gemini? 

$ openssl s_client -quiet -crlf -connect mozz.us:1965 <<< gemini://mozz.us/ 2>/dev/null | file --brief --mime-type --mime-encoding -
text/plain; charset=utf-8


Validating the encoding would be informative as well:

$ openssl s_client -quiet -crlf -connect mozz.us:1965 <<< gemini://mozz.us/ 2>/dev/null | iconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 > /dev/null; echo $?
0


Ditto for guessing the actual language:

# echo $(openssl s_client -quiet -crlf -connect mozz.us:1965 <<< gemini://mozz.us/ 2>/dev/null ) | polyglot detect | cut -d' ' -f1 | uniq

No, the specification specifies that default is utf-8, so unspecified is utf-8.
I do not set the charset in my server headers as it is redundant because I always send utf-8.

Language is not the same, because the specification explicitely says that there is no default, so my server always send the lang= header tag for text/gemini content.

Trust on first use (TOFU) has been waved as a talisman meant to absolve Gemini from actually defining it.

What does TOFU means for Gemini, in practice? Gory, precise details wanted.

Thank you kindly!

I went ahead and switched Doppio over to using the TLS_* meta-variables that you listed. It makes sense to prioritize interop among Gemini servers than between Gemini and Apache httpd. I did leave support for the mod_ssl variables in there, but disabled by default. Maybe they?ll go away completely, some day.

I also tossed in TLS_CLIENT_VERSION, TLS_CLIENT_SERIAL, and TLS_SESSION_ID for parity with what I?d already done with the mod_ssl stuff. They seem reasonable.

I?ll take a look at the GEMINI_* meta-variables next. They seem pretty straightforward.

Thanks for the feedback!

Message-ID: <C89QUI2P78W7.31U3J9K3IS166@localhost>

Hi all --

I noticed there may be a bit of ambiguity in the spec:

> Lines beginning with ">" are quote lines.  This line type exists so
> that advanced clients may use distinct styling to convey to readers the
> important semantic information that certain text is being quoted from

What isn't clear is whether subsequent quote lines ought to be
considered as part of the same quote block, ie, say my client surrounds
quotations with " marks. Should these marks surround each line, or
surround an entire block of subsequent quote lines?

The clients that I tested did the latter, and this seems intuitively
correct, but the spec doesn't make this explicit.

Let me know what you all think.

All the best,

Alex

What Amfora does tries to stay in line with the gemtext idea that each line stands
on its own. So quote lines are wrapped, and "> " is put in front of each one. But
if there is another quote line below, that's considered a separate quote line, and
is processed separately from the others, it's not made to be part of the previous
quote somehow.

So this gemtext:

> very long quote line very long quote line very long quote line very long quote line very long quote line
> another quote

might be rendered like this:

> very long quote line very long quote line very long quote line
> very long quote line very long quote line
> another quote


> What isn't clear is whether subsequent quote lines ought to be

Despite what I said above, I think it makes sense for other clients to consider
quote lines to be part of the same block. Amfora can get away with ignoring this,
but in a GUI client that maybe puts quotes in a box or something? It would look
pretty ugly to separate them, I think.

The spec says that the only state that a parser need to keep is the one
for the preformatted block, so I guess the intention is to treat
subsequent quotes as distinct quotes, the same way subsequent paragraphs
are considered distinct.

A line is "one" line. So "one line" starting with ">" and
optional space is a quote and is rendered as one block.
Email type quotes with ">" on every line, happen to be
subsequent blocks in gemini layout.

At least that is what I understand.

Well, I quite strongly oppose this idea.
If your table like layout cannot be made with toggling
preformatted lines useing ```, what's the point then?
If you really need tables, maybe large tables, who is stopping
the author from using xml, http, csv, or whatnot, and make it a
downloadable file?

This makes sense to me. Maybe a note could be added to the sepc about
this, since its somewhat unintuitive, e.g. different than how quote
lines work in email, etc.  Lagrange, for example, considers subsequent
quote lines as par of a block quote.

This came up when I was quoting song lyrics. A solution I suppose would
be to use a preformatted block (that's how I've encouraged my poet
friend to write whitespace-aware stanzas)

Clever. You could even do it inline, in one go, curtesy of the data URI scheme. ?

For example, given a data encoded text/csv link:

=> data:text/csv;1997%2CFord%2CE350 table

A smart client could render the above as a table, inline, without further ado. 

No need to expend gemini/text further, as it's already infinitely expendable today.

I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean by this.  Also, I actually
don't like the ```...``` layout I've used here, and I'm open to
suggestions for replacing it.  The primary concern to me is the actual
table syntax.

Well, yes, I agree.  In fact, I said the same thing in my initial mail
on this topic.  But what about small tables?  Yes, they can be done in a
separate file, but that's often too much work for them - it's much
easier to just do it inline.  Especially when there are many of them.
Having a separate file also makes it harder on users, particularly for
those who don't have clients that do table inlining (e.g. gmnlm).

Use embedded data links:

=> data:text/csv;1997%2CFord%2CE350 Table Caption

Ask you favorite client to render them inline.

Hmmm?

If anything, gemini/text is... purely about information?

Put another way, text/gemini has no control over presentation. None.

Presentation is the remit of the user-agent, the client.

The only escape hatch is the pre-formatted block, ala ```, which is meant to be rendered 'as-is', in monospace fonts. Therefore the endless overloading of that construct for many exotic purposes.

5.4.4 Preformatted text lines
"Preformatted text lines should be presented to the user in a "neutral", monowidth font without any alteration to whitespace or stylistic enhancements."

But of course, we also have links.

Links can be resolved, and rendered, in any creative way a smart client sees fit.

For example, an embedded text/csv, encoded as a data link, could be rendered in place into a beautiful looking table by the discerning user-agent:

=> data:text/csv;1997%2CFord%2CE350 Table Caption

Gentoo has reached the same conclusion:

[gentoo-dev] [News review] LibreSSL support discontinued 

"To the best of our knowledge, the only benefit LibreSSL has over OpenSSL
right now is the additional libtls library.  For this reason, we have
packaged dev-libs/libretls which is a port of this library that links
to OpenSSL."

Sure. It's wikipedia, they must deal with non-compliant clients. They are a public service, pretty much.

How does your server handles it? What's your excuse?

No reply needed. You are in good company, not even the intern who implemented the Go library during last summer of code got it right. No shame.

Let me help:

This gets published as b/w.gmi, according to your own account.

If a client request such url, on your server, what would happen? Some magic ala wikipedia? 51 NOT FOUND? Something else?

No reply needed either.

  So where is your server and client that is correctly written?

You do realize I couldn't care less about what your code does or doesn't do, right? It's your code after all. No one else care.

But do not bullshit me in regards to what an URL is or isn't. No amount of historicism is going to get you out of this one. 

A simple "not supported" would do. Again, no one cares.

Again, best to drop it.

I think having some, any, sort of table syntax that can be adjusted by
the client is useful.


Perhaps a balance between pre-formatted and attached could be something like
```parse:table
+--------------------------------+-------+
| Food                           | Price |
+--------------------------------+-------+
| Eggs                           | $2    |
| Eggs and spam                  | $4    |
| Just spam                      | $2    |
+--------------------------------+-------+
```
This way, clients don't *have* to parse it, but if supported, they can.


Perhaps easier to parse would be.
```parse:table:/link/to/file.csv
+--------------------------------+-------+
| Food                           | Price |
+--------------------------------+-------+
| Eggs                           | $2    |
| Eggs and spam                  | $4    |
| Just spam                      | $2    |
+--------------------------------+-------+
```
This could again be optional and would allow for choice on whether
content authors want their tables rendered and if clients support it. If
the client doesn't support it, the table would show up as pre-formatted.

The second approach would require more work by authors but the
preformatted tables can be easily generated from a CSV (or any other
format) by servers or static site generators.

You already have a least a third of the messages on this list, never can?t really tell if it?s just contrarian or real suggestions. At least there is food for thoughts.
Perhaps it?s time for you to actually use the protocol and share some of your ideas in a more constructive way?

Thanks. No anger though. Plain spoken if anything. Possibly chatty. 

That said, if mild technical challenges make some lose bowel control in a fit of rage, then perhaps best not to go to the IETF afterall. They will shred this to pieces.

Nothing wrong keeping it "speculative" and casual. Formalism can be overrated.

Plenty of things would be useful. The question isn't "is it useful?" The
question is "can we do without?"

Ah, yes. Abusing the alt text. I've done that [1] and Solderpunk was not
exactly amused. [2]

Sure, use of alt text is at the client's discretion and the spec mentiones
using it to indicate a programming language. Do keep in mind that it will
be read out to visually impaired users, so please go easy on the syntax.

For links, I recommend link lines. That way, everyone can get the file.

Here is another example, with added line numbers to show intentional line
breaks:

00]
01] ``` The table listing Food and Price says: Eggs are $2, Eggs and spam
are $4, Just spam are $2.
02] +--------------------------------+-------+
03] | Food                           | Price |
04] +--------------------------------+-------+
05] | Eggs                           | $2    |
06] | Eggs and spam                  | $4    |
07] | Just spam                      | $2    |
08] +--------------------------------+-------+
09] ```
10] => /link/to/file.csv parse:table
11]

>
I put the link line on line 10 but you could put it on line 0 if you want.

No, you said ?Not quite.? when Stephane said UTF-8 had quasi-monopoly, and you rectified ?Unspecified rules?.
Unspecified is UTF-8, by specification. So UTF-8 does have a quasi-monopoly.

> No one said it was the same. But it would be interesting to know.

The fact that you made a difference between unspecified and utf-8 for encoding, and that you provided both tools to detect encoding and language made it seem like you were considering both cases the same, while encoding is always known (unspecified == utf-8) while language is sometimes unknown.
I also explicitely pointed this difference to encourage people to specify the language in their Gemini headers, as a lot of Gemini pages currently have an unspecified language.

> What's your server? We can validate that promptly.

Please stop splitting your answers in several emails like this, it?s uselessly filling the mailing list and making discussions harder to follow.
I do not need to validate that, I know that my server header does not contain a charset tag.

Subject: [Tech] Useless statistics of the day: status codes
Message-ID: <20210104105341.GA9752@sources.org>

In the database of the Lupa crawler
<gemini://gemini.bortzmeyer.org/software/lupa/>, I find the following
status codes (by order of decreasing frequency):

(The status codes are documented in
<gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.gmi#fragments_could_be_useful_to_indicate_the_exact_section>.)

20 : OK
51 : Not found, because many links no longer work, already, or may be
never worked
31 : Permanent redirection (Lupa adds the target URI to its database
but keeps the original one)
30 : Temporary redirection
10 : Input, there are 310 URI replying by asking for input
50 : Permanent failure, something wrong in the server
40 : Temporary failure, server overloaded?
60 : Client certificate required, 40 URI require this authentication
42 : The ultimate answer (no, actually, CGI error)
53 : Proxy request refused (typically a name pointing to an IP address
where the server is not configured for this virtual host)

The rest is marginal, less than ten URI:

49 : First status code I find which is not in the official
specification. Anyone has an idea? Two URI.
2 : Old server with the deprecated one-digit status codes?
39 : Not in the official specification. Anyone has an idea? Two URI.
59 : Bad request (no idea why my client sends bad requests)
99 : Not in the official specification. Anyone has an idea? Two URI.
58 : Not in the official specification. Anyone has an idea? Two URI.
29 : Not in the official specification. Anyone has an idea? Two URI.
43 : Proxy error. Reason unknown.
61 : Certificate not authorised. Since I do not send client
certificates, this is surprising.
41 : Server not available (maintenance, for instance).
52 : Gone. Like 51 but final. Just one URI,
<gemini://gemini.conman.org/no-longer-here/> so it's probably a test.
22 : Not in the official specification. Anyone has an idea? One URI.
69 : Not in the official specification. Anyone has an idea? One URI.
19 : Not in the official specification. Anyone has an idea? One URI.

The number of status codes not registered in the specification may
mean that some servers are extending the Gemini protocol with unused
status codes. But some are also in test capsules like
<gemini://gemini.conman.org/> or <gemini://egsam.glv.one/>.

Note that Lupa did not find even one occurrence of:

11 : Sensitive input
44 : Slow down (may be because the crawler is nice)
62 : Certificate not valid (which makes sense since I don't send
certificates)

since a desire for this was expressed, I have adapted the agate gemini server to
do proxying instead[1]. It is intended to be run on port 80. You can still run a
web server on the standard 443 port, in fact the server will try to redirect
HTTP requests to the HTTPS version of the website (it just spits out some HTTP
response if the TLS connection cannot be established as an assumption).

The certificate policy is very weak, it will simply accept any certificate. I
think that is the laziest and easiest solution, while of course a major flaw.
If you know better, you are welcome to submit a patch/open a pull request.

I am running a demo on my own VPS, for some basic instructions you can go to
<gemini://qwertqwefsday.eu:80/>.[2] And you'll have to find a client that can
make use of proxying if you really want to try it. I did some rudimentary tests,
but am not sure how well it works. If you encounter issues, feel free to reach
out to me (or open an issue/pull request on GitHub[1]).

My server may be the cause of the 39 codes. When I have read the
specs I missed the appendix so I assumed all 3x code were fine for
redirecting and I chose 39.  While looking why Amfora client was
complaining about "unknown status core 39" on irc #gemini, I've
been told to look at the appendix and I realized my mistake.

I use that one! :)

But perhaps not exactly for the intended purpose.

It goes like this:

(1) An URL is submitted for analyzes
(2) The service responds with a 31 redirect to where the result will be 
(3) If the results are not there yet, the service responds with a 44 (try again later)
(4) Eventually, once processed, the service responds with 20 (ok, or some errors when appropriate)

Kind of an asynchronous API of sort.

Remember that not everything has to be inline. Images aren't inline in
gemtext, and tables are a lot like images. In my opinion, the most
Gemini way of presenting a table is a link to a text/csv document.

It looks like no one has mentioned box-drawing characters yet, they
look good, are supported as part of UTF-8, and I suspect they'd be
easy to parse.

Even though they could be inlined, using data: links.

For example, a SVG image, data: encoded, could be rendered inline by a smart client:

=> data:image/svg+xml;%3Csvg%20height%3D%22100%22%20width%3D%22100%22%3E%3Ccircle%20cx%3D%2250%22%20cy%3D%2250%22%20r%3D%2240%22%20stroke%3D%22black%22%20stroke-width%3D%223%22%20fill%3D%22red%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E image caption

Same, but base64 encoded:

=> data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9IjEwMCIgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iNTAiIGN5PSI1MCIgcj0iNDAiIHN0cm9rZT0iYmxhY2siIHN0cm9rZS13aWR0aD0iMyIgZmlsbD0icmVkIi8+PC9zdmc+ image caption

  The Gemini Client Torture Test [1] is responsible for the following
erroneous status codes:

	99, 29, 39, 49, 58, 2, and 0.

  I know there's another client test out there, so it could be that as well.

Hello everyone.

I'd like to share a small project allowing anyone creating his own part of gemspace.
In a few words, I set up a chrooted STFP server (ssh pubkey only) which content is served to the gemspace.
Not much to read yet, but I hope this ?-la-tilde idea will sow some seeds in others mind.

It is called a sietch, in reference to Dune.

See you in gemspace, cow(boy|girl)s ;)

There is certainly room for improvement in the memory use department.

Possible reasons:

* Bugs. I wouldn't rule out a memory leak or too lazily freed buffers somewhere.
* Aggressive buffering of visible content. Copies of the visible regions of the page and sidebars (with 50% extra) are kept in memory for quick redrawing.
* Custom text rendering. All the fonts are loaded to memory (19 MB of TTF data), and furthermore there is quite a large cache of used glyphs for quickly drawing them.
* The navigation cache is kept in memory, including full contents of gemtext pages.
* Something I've overlooked? I'll investigate...

Hi all,

I've written a little program called gmi2html which just translates 
text/gemini to HTML so if you want to serve the same content on gemini 
and the web you can.

You can find it here:

https://github.com/shtanton/gmi2html

Apologies for distributing gemini software over the web D: I'll get it 
on my own gemini space once it's up and running.

Hopefully it's helpful, I found existing implementations in python and 
go, but I'm probably not the only person here who appreciates a tiny 
executable that runs really fast and barely allocates heap memory.

Cheers all,

shtanton (or Charlie if you want)

  What's not ANSI about it?  It's perfectly find C99 code.

I'm liking Zig more and more but I haven't written anything big in it yet

Nice! Made me realise I'm not escaping stuff so I'll add that soonish.

Also does anyone know if running a gemini server through stunnel or
something is a good idea? Obviously a gemini server without TLS isn't a
gemini server but it might be nice since it would make the server code
simpler. Of course authy stuff probably won't work, but I feel like it
could for a static site. I'll probably just use gmnisrv instead of writing
my own for once.

Cannot answer the "good idea" part, but yes, I do exactly that, either stunnel, or djb style ala USCPI.

In what circumstances?  If the URL bar or text link says "b%2Fw.gmi",
that's what should be sent to the server; if it says "b/w.gmi", then *that*
is what should be sent to the server.  The server may treat those

The server ought to treat http://abc.com:80/~smith/home.html and
http://abc.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html exactly the same, per RFC 2616.

My bad, I'm confused.
It's not ANSI, but POSIX (because it use getline())

All of these changes are fine by me. Thanks, in particular, for the
explicit text around the TLS close_notify alert. This had tripped me up
with Space Age when I first wrote it and was one of those things I had
to figure out and fix by trial and error awhile ago.

It sounds like your change to let clients start handling responses
before receiving the TLS close_notify alert from the server means that
streaming content is now officially supported over Gemini. Do I have
that right?

Thanks again for making Geminispace a reality.

Happy hacking,

That's a fair question. One of the recommendations you made for server
authors was that we should redirect any URLs that don't end with a / to
their equivalent paths with / appended.

Thus a URL like    gemini://mycapsule.org/foo?somequery
should redirect to gemini://mycapsule.org/foo/?somequery
in order for the client to be able to correctly resolve any relative
URLs in links within the returned gemtext document (assuming this URL
responds with gemtext).

This is what I currently do in Space Age. If we were to mandate dropping
the query string, I suspect we would end up with some very broken
dynamic pages in Geminispace.

YMMV,
  Gary

A few other issues that have come up and could use spec-level
clarification:

1. What are the valid/invalid/recommended values for CN, SAN, and
   expiration dates in certificates in the context of TOFU?

   It has been suggested on the mailing list that none of these values
   should have meaning under a TOFU security model. Others argue that
   they should have specific values and meanings. Clarity would be
   appreciated.

2. Client use of URL fragments (jump to heading, full text search, etc.)

   Arguments for a variety of options (including none) have already been
   presented in another mailing list thread.

3. Extending bulleted lists to three level to match headings (*, **, ***)

   Gemtext only defines a single-level unordered list line type (*). It
   was shown on the mailing list some time ago that different clients
   may have quite different ways of rendering attempts by authors to
   create nested list outlines. Here are two examples, both of which
   have variable renderings depending on the client used:

   * TODOs
   ** Work
   *** Check email
   *** Be productive
   ** Home
   *** Eat food
   *** Clean body
   *** Get off your couch occasionally

   * TODOs
    * Work
     * Check email
     * Be productive
    * Home
     * Eat food
     * Clean body
     * Get off your couch occasionally

   It seems (at least to my eyes), that the (*, **, ***) examples are
   more in line with Gemini's 3-character line type indicator rule and
   match the same style as the three heading levels (#, ##, ###). Adding
   these to the Gemtext spec should be a strictly accretive (and
   therefore non-breaking) change that would standardize their display
   in different Gemini browsers.

4. Providing a concrete example of how to use text after opening ``` to
   specify client behavior (e.g., source code highlighting).

   The Gemini spec mentions that the alt text can be used for this
   purpose but doesn't provide any clear mechanism for how this should
   be done. This leaves the choice entirely up to different clients,
   which seems like a recipe for competing browser wars and "Best Viewed
   In" notes on Gemtext pages. This is probably less than ideal.

Okay, that's all I can think of at the moment. Good luck mulling all
these issues over.

Happy hacking,
  Gary

No.

In short, client should not mess around with queries, aside from moving them along.

Please do not redefine the handling & meaning of what an URL is.

Fragments are different as they refer to an anchor within a target gemini/text. gemini/text has no concept of anchors, therefore fragments make no sense for gemini/text.

But they make sense for http://+text/html though.

TOFU, as practiced by ssh & co., is about key exchange. One accepts a key, from a given host. There is no notion of "certificates", much less X.509 certificates, just a host+key pair.

Certificates should be entirely ignored as far as TOFU goes. And only viewed as a way to transfer the key. An envelope for the key, due to TLS.

Trying to merge the semantic of the X.509 certificates PKI and TOFU is not TOFU anymore. SEITAN perhaps. An entirely different construct for sure.

Also, regarding TOFU (probably the worst part of the current
specification), there are many other clarifications requested:

* should the client consider the whole certificate or just the public
key? The spec says the whole certificate but I don't see the point if
the rest of the certificate is not used.
* interactions between TOFU and valid certificates. For instance,
should a client disable TOFU when the certificate is valid?
* rewrite the sentence "the previous certificate's expiry date has not
passed" because you don't renew a certificate when it is expired, but
a few days/weeks before.

> 2. Client use of URL fragments (jump to heading, full text search, etc.)

There are actually two separate issues with fragments:

* Behavior during redirection
* Semantics for text/gemini

Message-ID: <87a6tm87h7.fsf@idiomdrottning.org>

# Schapcom

gemini://idiomdrottning.org/schapcom

Schapcom is a feed aggregator for Gemini similar to CAPCOM.

Schapcom is written in Chicken Scheme using a ton of libraries so it's
not lightweight in that regard. It's just a quick fix to get something
to work.

Schapcom uses a three-tiered model of Feeds?Curators?Aggregated Feeds.

## Feeds

Schapcom is compatible with both Gemfeed and Gmisub feed formats.

=> https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/gemfeed Gemfeed
=> gemini://calcuode.com/gmisub-readme.gmi Gmisub

Feeds are Atom feeds (a la Gemfeed) or gmisub feeds.

## Curators

Curators set up lists of URLs of such feeds that they wanna follow. Each
line needs to end with .xml or .gmi, and this list of URLs should be in
a text file, one url per line, no other lines, no comments no header no
nothing, and end with a .txt file ending. The list of URLs can be on
gemini or on http / https, to minimize the amount of work that curators
need to do. They only need to be able to host a text file, anywhere.

## Aggregators

Each Schapcom instance is then pointed to a list of such lists. It
writes a gmi file (similar to CAPCOM's output format) and then
terminates. It shows duplicates-deleted union of entries so it's fine if
a feed is accidentally entered twice, or entered in multiple formats, or
if an entry shows up several times or in several feeds.

So the intent is that a curator's list of follows can be read and used
by several Schapcom instances.

Finding cool feeds to follow is hard work, so leveraging each other's
work around that is the idea.

Run from cron or manually.

schapcom [curator-url1] [curator-url2] [curator-url3] > feeds.gmi

For a repo, git clone https://idiomdrottning.org/schapcom

Subject: [tech] Gemini Acentred Messaging System
Message-ID: <1918067.gcu01Q82e1@tempete>

Hello,

I would like to propose a specification for a board system allowing to reply to each other through gemlogs.

There have been some attempt at forum-like gemini capsules in the past, such as motm (gemini://illegaldrugs.net/cgi-bin/motm/boards), and most of them are based on Gemini input request, or require use of another protocol such as Titan, Inimeg, Dioscuri?

There is also GUS backlinks, which may be used to check if someone replied to a gemlog post, but GUS is seldomly updated, and not everyone is checking backlinks to its gemlog posts.

So, the idea behind GAMS is to use gemlogs to reply to each other, and have a board capsule which lists threads and responses. This allows to use a really simple setup, and avoid needing an auth system, or an upload protocol supported by gemini clients.
Another nice thing is that you can post on several boards using the same gemlog with different tags (allowing for subject-specific, or language-specific boards).

The draft specification is here: gemini://gemlog.lanterne.chilliet.eu/GAMS.en.gmi
Any feedback is welcome.

I originally intended to annouce this with a working capsule directly, but I?m having a hard time finding time to implement a board, and I wanted to do something completely based on text/gemini files for data to avoid using a database and it?s harder than anticipated.
I still think I will post a POC in a few days/weeks, but it may be instable.

C?me

I really like this idea! Mixing the ease of writing, simplicity, and
asynchronicity of gemlog replies with the ease of reading on a
centralized page instead of searching out all the relevant posts on an
aggregator.

I link to GUS' backlinks on my own gemlog, but by the time GUS
updates (last updated: 2020-12-06) my posts are usually over a month
old, making the backlinks practically useless to anyone following the
conversation as it unfolds. Another way to have these sorts of
conversation are in order, saving people from having to make posts
listing the full conversation like:
gemini://republic.circumlunar.space/users/flexibeast/gemlog/2021-01-06.gmi

I see no reason why your board server couldn't use a database (or a
non-gemtext file format) in the backend.  It would probably make it a
lot easier when querying and parsing since you can use a custom
structure that suits your internal data format, then just render to
gemtext once you're done.

> The board should present a threaded view of messages
I have mixed feelings on threaded forums in general, but if you think
it's best it it's not the end of the world.  However, it would
/significantly/ simplify implementations if you just chronologically
grouped messages by post tag.  You'd no longer have to query every
single tagged post and find the first link, instead just querying the
gemini feed page, saving lots of server time and bandwidth for both the

However, this non-threaded approach creates a problem.  This is the only
situation I've come across so far that is actually limited by the gemini
feed's no timestamp limitation.  Since conversations can happen in the

I dunno, it's something to ponder on. I do love the idea though, and
will be trying out your implementation when it's done.

There is no reason other than it was what I was feeling like doing. I dislike setting up and using databases and I liked the idea of having something really simple, and as static as possible.
But of course another implementation of the same specification could be built upon a database and even be fully dynamic.

I like the idea of replying to a specific message of the thread, as we do on mailing list.

Maybe I should add the requirement that the post link to the board thread as well as the post it?s responding to. This would ease updating because you know exactly in which thread a message goes without searching in the thread.
But I liked the simplicity of just linking to what you are anwsering.

  Why the hardcoded extensions?  It doesn't seem like it should matter given
that you'll get a MIME type of "text/gemini" or "application/atom+xml" that
will tell you what type of feed it is.

  I only ask as someone who uses .gemini and .atom as the extensions.

Oh, it's a personal choice for your implementation, that's obviously
perfectly fine.  I was thinking it was a requirement for all
implementations or something like that.

I guess the fact that it's using gemlogs (which are usually longer-form
than your average comment on a forum) as the posting medium mitigates
my main complaints with threaded forums?namely, encouraging low-effort
or otherwise filler comments and encouraging tangential and off-topic
discussions.  Upon thinking about it more, I think threaded would be
fine or preferable for this style of board.

I think it would be best to just link to what you're replying too as
well.  As long as you take uri normalization and encoding into account,
it wouldn't be any harder to match a link to an arbitrary post in a
thread as it would to match the base board link.

Subject: [tech] A '.well-known/' path for contact information?
Message-ID: <20210107013604.rizy3s5ecocuycfq@devbox>

I've noticed a lot chatter recently about ways to allow comments on
posts. Sometimes the objective is to drop a message to the author,
sometimes to allow a public discussion.

I not personally interested in public comments, but I am very interested
making it easier for authors to be reached.

I've been wondering whether adopting a /.well-known/contact.txt
convention for sharing contact details. This idea has been blatantly
stolen from security.txt?. This will allow for things like:

- automated back-link notifications for authoring tools.
- with client support, users to respond to a page from within the
  client.
- and emails addresses could be harvested en mass for nefarious
  purposes.

A solution like this isn't obviously workable for public discussions,
but a commenting system could be cobbled together to ingest messages
received via SMTP. It may require additional conventions like a header
(or subject line) that hints to which post being discussed. It may also
require a way to signal that anything sent to the address will be
public.

To me, something like this feels more in spirit of Gemini, but really
who am I to say. :)

  There's http://humanstxt.org/ that does what you want.  You might want to

If you're getting into threading, and reconstructing a thread from
back-references that may be incomplete, you should definitely read this:

https://www.jwz.org/doc/threading.html

It describes how threading was implemented for both mail and USENET in
Netscape Navigator. Besides providing an algorithm, JWZ also shows that
you don't need a database to do it (even for efficiency).

If you include one link in the head of your post format, that's
equivalent to "In-Reply-To"; if you include all the links back to the
root, that's "References". There's no equivalent to including the root
and the parent, but maybe you can see how that would affect the
algorithm. 

BTW, I want to say I really like the *idea* of this way of doing a
board, for several reasons, not the least of which is that it does not
involve bolting on any kind of POST semantics to Gemini.

I think it's a good idea in principle, but it is maybe not well-suited
for multi-user sites, which a lot of Gemini sites are.

Yeah, that's what I'm looking for. Thanks.

humans.txt attributes everyone to everything. That's not really going to
allow an automated tool to extract the correct contact details for a
page. For that, something else is needed; either some sort of reference
in the source page, or a default human.

A default human would be good enough for domains where everything should
be attributed to one human which seems to be the norm around here.

The default human could simply be the first listed in humans.txt.

Hmm. I assumed that most sites were on their own domain.

On a multi-tenanted host, is each tenant generally confined to a unix
homedir? For example `/~${USER}/*`. If that's the case, checking the
users root before hitting the root shouldn't be unreasonable.

Subject: [tech] Managing un-moderated account creation and it's side-effects
Message-ID: <CAFwUW912fvb4J05HxdEB8P5M0htbGAWhrmDjhhKXDPy6i3c-eg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I've been enjoying the gemini-space and I'm excited that this email signals
my attempt to join more vocally. Hopefully my attempts to support Gemini
end up being acceptable or at the least agreeable. :-)

I've been working on a server and client for Gemini and I'm nearing the end
of what I wanted to explore in my implementations... but I have a few
questions that I'd love some help thinking through. I'd like to cover one
of those questions in this email.

One of my goals has been to have a client / server pairing that
supports helping non-technical users go from downloading a client to
posting content as quickly and painlessly as possible. In my mind this
means allowing new accounts to be created *without* moderating their
creation... which leaves me wondering how I might respond to side-effects
like any unwelcome content (illegal, offensive, spam, etc.).

I understand that walking down a path that allows un-moderated account
creation is asking for trouble. I'm still interested in exploring
the possibilities to see if a compromise might be found for
my implementations.

One of the options I'm considering is to restrict the number of posts a new
account can make. Say, only "one page"? This wouldn't remove *all* negative
side-effects, but seems to discourage some abuse and facilitate any
clean-up since there'd only be one 'thing' to remove.

Another option is to limit the *kind* of content that a new account can
provide. Say, no links? This could curtail a type of side-effect
(facilitating access to external content through my domain/server), but not
entirely, since text/gemini *without* explicit links could just as easily
be a link-in-plain-text that is copied and used somewhere else.

A third option I'm considering is to limit the visibility of the content
that a new account can provide. I've written an HTTP server that provides
access to the Gemini content, so, maybe I disallow any content from
accounts less than say, 1 month old? If a new account were showing promise
as a positive contributor I could manually enable it sooner than a month...
a sort of default-deny with a manual-allow. Content could of course still
be viewed through a Gemini-specific client, just not through a web browser.

The last option I've been mulling over is to just accept the side-effects,
but that feels too much like an ends-justify-means approach which I find
weak as a motivation... but... I *almost* prefer encouraging communication
and creation enough to endure negative side-effects.

I guess one way to sum up the sharp corner I'm trying to round-off is that
I have two goals that seem to oppose each other: encourage creation of
content *and* discourage creation of 'wrong' content. I'm very sensitive to
this concept of 'wrong' content too... (I'm *very* uninterested in limits
to agency, but there's the swinging fists and noses point in the middle of
that)... but that's a different discussion.

I have memories of some server implementations simply requiring manual
account creation approvals, which, as mentioned, is what I'm hoping to
avoid... I *know* this is a tough complication. As some additional
information, all I have set up as required for account creation is to
provide a certificate. I plan on using the subject-common-name and first
few characters from the generated fingerprint as the account name... so...
no email verification, and no way to know if some spammer is just creating
a bunch of new accounts for similar purposes.

There's more thought I've had, but I'll stop rambling there.

Thanks for reading this far. :-D

Thoughts?

You'd have drive-by abusers, but in my experience those sort of users 
post will do a burst of posts and either leave or they are banned. Making it
easy to tag those sorts of posts so a moderator can clean them up is key. 

Also, remember that some days a reasonable person of good intent will
have a bad community day. 

Sometimes you don't need a ban, but just a takedown and a, "hey, don't
do that" backed up with bans for people who don't get the message.

You could also do invites so you can do controlled growth.

Limiting new account privileges is a one way to start, in terms of 
no-links, no-attachments, no tagging other users, no direct replies.

One of the issues I dealt with, was too many permissions for new posts 
which caused confusion or missing steps in process. That's less likely for 
people just making posts.

A friend has given a lot of though to the onboarding problem, 
https://gist.github.com/aredridel/470d6d186f3d848b3a7eeb6f8fa8dcf9,
and one of the suggestions is about getting people into community. 

So you could ask someone joining "what content you want to find? Cooking, 
Rust, anime, crochet, axe throwing, etc.." and plug them into that community
to start, then broaden the scope as they make connections.

You will have to do some bootstrapping of community, but expectations
are a lot easier to build out of a group of people invested in making
community.

Creating community and creation are good, and don't get in the the way 
of people doing that, but doing things in the way that someone can't
wreck the place either intentionally or not.

  It might not always be the case that a user's directory is marked by a
'~'.  For instance, on <gemini://republic.cirumlunar.space/> users are under
<gemini://republic.circumlunar.space/users/>.

  I am not a lawyer, so take what I say with a few bolders of salt.

  How concerned are you?  I can see where you might be subject to:

	* laws where you live
	* laws of the domain you register (for instance, the purely
	  fictional .fd top level domain (Freedonia) might  subjects you to
	  its punative libel and copyright laws despite where you or the
	  server or your users are located)
	* laws where the server resides
	* laws where the user lives

All of those might be the same country; it might not.  The US has strong
freedom of speech codes and thus libel cases are harder to prosecute (to a
degree); the UK has less free speech and very strong libel laws (compared to
the US) so you might be liable for something a user said.  Again, it
depends upon jurisdiction.

  I know the US (since I live there) tries to make a distinction between a
"publisher" and a "platform" and one of the differences comes down to
moderation---do too much and you can fall into the "publisher" category
which makes you more liable for what is said than if you are in the
"platform" category.  Too little moderation and, as you say, is also
troublesome.

  Okay, ignoring legal liabilities, one way might be to use an "invite-only"
system.  The website Lobsters (https://lobste.rs/) uses an invite system. 
Users can invite new users (even ones they don't know) but they then become
liable for the new users behavior.  I'm checking the current moderation
queue for users [1], and while most are userid changes (foo changed username
to bar), some users have been banned (mostly for spamming; one for
"repeatedly trying to use Lobsters to whip up an online outrage mob against
organizations they don't care for"), some have had invites disabled for
inviting too many other people who have been banned.  That seems to work for
Lobsters.

  Also, trying to invoke a community spirit can help.

I guess traversing up the tree looking for a humans.txt file would work.

Finding the humans.txt file for a document at
`/users/jon/gemlog/2021-01-07-a-new-doc/index.gmi` would search:

- /users/jon/gemlog/2021-01-07-a-new-doc/humans.txt
- /users/jon/gemlog/humans.txt
- /users/jon/humans.txt
- /users/humans.txt
- /humans.txt

This would allow one document, or an entire branch of the tree have a
different contact than the rest, but it's a lot more complex than simply
hitting up /humans.txt.

Even though it handles the edge cases, I'm less enthusiastic about this
solution. What was initially a simple task of fetching /humans.txt is,
well not that anymore.

Message-ID: <87o8i16rzy.fsf@idiomdrottning.org>

OK, Schapcom now updated to not dispatch on file extensions. (It now
looks at the contents of the file so even the mime types can be
wrong?this is not a deliberate design decision, it just ended up being
the way easier implementation.)

Grumble grumble? This is one of the reasons I was so grumpy about the
gmisub format: it adds work! Now every aggregator app writer needs to be
able to handle two standards. If gmisub had been a tool that read
capsules and output atom, that would've been awesome? Instead, it's a
protocol?an interfacing touch point that we all must now be mindful of.

File extensions does still matter in one circumstance?if a log is
subscribed to in duplicate, Schapcom prioritizes entries from logs that
end with .xml (or, now, .atom). This only matters when the same log ?
the same entries ? is subscribed to in both gmisub and atom.

Put another way, gmisub entries are assumed to be made at noon while
atom entries have a more detailed time description. If the same
duplicate entry shows up, Schapcom uses the file extension to determine
if it's in atom or not. So if you have an atom feed named .broccoli and
a gemsub feed named .asparagus and they contain the same entries, they
might get interpreted as being posted at noon (at that point, it'd
depend on which feed is fetched first). Author of gmisub argues that
this noon thing rarely matters. An argument that I can defer to without
having to agree with?

The reason it has to look at file extensions for this instead of making
requests to get the headers is because it does this by sorting the url
list.

There is an email field in the certificate for this, I don?t know about other authors, but I put my email in the email field of certificates for my capsules.
This does not work for multi-user domains, but as the rest of the thread shows, the *.txt solution does not easily support them either.

I also wanted to note that authors expecting comments by email using a specific subject syntax can just use a mailto link at the end of the article, and I?ve seen several gemlogs already doing this.
Example: gemini://ybad.name/log/2021-01-02.gmi (this one even use a mailing list for commenting it seems)

I assume you are referring to a capsule in the format of the companion

pedantic, but it might be nice to point it out explicitly.

You have taken a quite liberal approach with the rest of the specification, so
I don't think you'd need to add this to it.

Seeing that the crawler will probably not pick up the post in real time, this is
a bit strict. Maybe relax it to something like "not before the last post",
because I think that's what would most likely be used in practice: Filter out
any posts that are older than when the board last checked that gemlog.

 > ..., containing the tag enclosed in square brackets in the title.

I personally would think of the tag as including the brackets, but that is
bikeshedding.

More importantly: It might be simpler if the tag was just a URL/domain of the
board or something like that. On the other hand that would eliminate something
like posting to mulitple boards with the same tag. But that practice would IMHO
only create problems e.g. when replying to someone on one board and it also
shows up on another, but the OP is not there. And using the URL/domain would be
a nice way to make sure the tags are unique.

I think it would be the easier solution to create a new thread if the first
link is to an unknown page, or if there is no link at all. If you think about
how threading works with e-mail, it also works that way. And yes sometimes it
breaks if the headers are not set right, but it will not be possible to build a
perfect system with this eiter.

Johann

I am referring to this specification when using the word ?gemfeed? in the section ?The board?. I could link to it, but thinking about it we may also live out of the specification which feed format are supported, if a board author wants to support atom or rss it would work too, they just have to indicate it to potential members.

Well the idea was to be able to link to the board thread before it is created, from the post creating the thread. For this it helps if the thread URI is predictable. But yeah, it may be specific to a board. In my tests so far I use a truncated sha1 of the URI of the first message.

This is bad wording. What I meant was that if you post a post on january 6th but date the post january 5th, the specification does not garantee that the board will see it.
Of course when the board crawls a feed, it fetch all messages dated from last visit (but last visit may be in the same day, in which case all messages dated today are fetched).
Feel free to suggest modifications to the text to make this clearer.

The tag needs to be in the message link from gemlog index, other links are not fetched, so board URL is too long to be used here.

Hum yeah that may be the best in practice. But I liked the idea of pointing to the board when posting a thread, so that people which do not know about the board can find it. But it may be just good practice and not specification per se.

Thank you for your input.

That's something I hadn't considered. Can you change the email address
without invalidating your TOFU cert? If not, then changing contact
details will be difficult.

That is something else I hadn't considered. But without formal way to
reliably scrape the contact details from a page, things aren't any
better than present. But that formality is certainly another approach
that could be taken. I remember a discussion how to know how the content
is licensed. One idea was a way to set key/value pairs that contains
this information. I'll try to dig up the thread. A solution for both
problems would be helpful.

Thank you for your ideas.

I hadn't given much thought to implementing specific mechanisms to make
moderation easier. I think I just thought, "It won't be difficult".
Implementing specific tools to help moderate is a good suggestion. I'll
look into it.

Too true. I like your suggestion of levels of response... I'll have to

I hadn't considered invites for general posts, but was starting to think
along those lines for facilitating community generation. A sort of ability
to make invite-only groups. Feels like an OK way to share moderation
ability. Maybe provide community managers with invite-only ability and a
pause button with eventual ban.

I think I agree. One of the points about text/gemini that I've enjoyed is
that there's so little there to begin with - not much to remove if a more
limited format is what's wanted.

Thanks for the link!

I think I'll have to spend some time thinking through flipping the problem
away from being about privacy... it's a different take...

I like the exploration of onboarding communities as a unit... not one-off
as individuals. Something like... you can start a community if you can get
5 others to join you in the waiting room and agree together to start a
community... or something...

I think I'm following your walk through the legal aspect... I guess that
was part of my thought process too... not too dominant, but part.

I'm not too worried - and now I can see how attempts to find a desirable
outcome from constricting and controlling too much might lead to an
undesirable outcome anyway if the situation is seen as more-like-publisher.
Good food for thought. I get the sense that you would lean more toward
little to no moderation, which can make sense. From the little that I've
seen, I *think* that if I wanted an 'account' on your gemini server I would
need to email you. Are you able to keep up with the invites, or, said
another way, do you sometimes wish you weren't in the middle?

This idea of invites becoming some form of responsibility appeals to me

The link worked fine for me and I'm not a member. Interesting that there
seem to be a dozen to a few dozen 'moderation actions' a week.

  If you are talking about this link:

	gemini://gemini.conman.org/conman-labs-private/

then no one has ever asked for access.  So in that sense, yes, I've been
able to keep up with the subscription rate.  It was more of a way for me to
test client certificates than anything else.

  Cool.  So you can get an idea for how that works then.

  I've already rejected tons of replies to this, so I think I'll ask a
question.  You are writing a client, and you come across this link:

=> %2E%2E/%52%3A%20%41%2F%42%20%31%25%20%40%20%24%33%3B%76%3D%31

  This is a relative URI, so this needs to be resolved against the base URI,
and for this question, the base URI is

	gemini://example.com/%66%6F%6F/%62%61%72%3B%33/

  How should the client (or a URI/URL/IRI parser) deal with such links. 
What, in your mind, should they manipulate or parse the URLs?  It's not a
matter of "no body should generate such links" because you can't control
that.  The client gets what it gets.

  When I wrote my URL parser, I wrote it to be useful to me (with the hope
that others would find it useful).  But it seems it does The Wrong Thing. 
So in your opinion, what should it, nay, MUST it do?

  Here's the list of references I've been pouring through the past week:

	RFC-1630	Jun 1994
	RFC-1738	Dec 1994
	RFC-1808	Jun 1995
	RFC-2396	Aug 1998
	RFC-3986	Jan 2005
	WHATWG URL	Jan 2021 (it keeps changing) [2]

  Also, do ANY existing URL parsing library get it right?  Please make sure
to justify your answer(s).

Subject: Message boards via e-mail, not Gemini
Message-ID: <25953RJBNA4ML.3VG2Z8RFFZIH6@nothien.uber.space>

I've been reading recent threads about message boards on Gemini, and
thinking about the idea of gemlog-based replies (which have been around
for quite a while now).  People have been dedicating a lot of time and
thought to making messageboard-like systems work over Gemini (e.g. ew0k
and their CGI script for receiving notifications to replies to gemlogs,
and see the more recent threads), but I don't see the point of doing
this.  We already have e-mail based message lists, and we've been using
them neatly for long-form (and to a lesser extent medium-form and
short-form) discussions for a while now.  E-mail has some of the
following advantages:

* decentralized / federated: there's no single source for e-mail,
  everybody has copies of the entire thing.  People can also make e-mail
  threads, particularly of messageboards/lists publicly accessible, like
  the archives for this mailing list, at
  https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/.

* well-established system: e-mail has been around for way longer than
  Gemini has.  I know we all here love Gemini, but e-mail is going to
  work better for a lot of people.  There are already tons of e-mail
  server setups and mail clients which people use - there's no need to
  develop more.

* notifications: people subscribed to a mailing list get mails, and
  everyone already checks their mail.  There's no need to make new
  applications to poll gemini pages to see if there are replies or
  anything.

* just as much variety in mail content: by default, we use text/plain
  here, but MIME was created for e-mail in the first place.  If you're
  in love with Gemtext, just send text/gemini e-mails - we can read
  them, they're plain text.

Instead of creating message board systems on Gemini, create servers /
libraries to view e-mail archives on Gemini.  I argue that Gemini is not
designed to handle back-and-forth communication, but rather to serve
information in a single direction.  We must only use protocols for
things they are well-suited to handle, otherwise we risk losing their
original purposes and leave behind a fog of unhelpful but deep-rooted
conventions.

Of course, I may be wrong.  These are just my thoughts on this.  What
are yours?

Hi All.

On this topic, yet digressing a bit from Gemini, I started working on a
bulletin board (and more*) system that supports full interaction via email --
and only via email. The system is called friSBEe, where the SBE stands for
service by email.  I created it at the beginning of this year but haven't
touched it much since.  It's pretty raw, but also very flexible and could
easily be extended to support Gemini connections.

If you're interested in this, check out: https://rawtext.club/~frisbee/  And
feel free to contact me if you would like to test it out.

* features include a BBS, a blog system, a choose-your-own text adventure,
  messaging between users (yes, text messages on top of text email), and a few
  others.

I've been making something like this to view mailing list archives that 
are hosted on sourcehut.

It uses the sourcehut API to retrieve lists and threads and then uses 
some simple formatting to display them as gemini pages.

I've opted to display all the email bodies as preformatted (like they 
appear on sourcehut too) partly because of the way the lines are wrapped.

It's only experimental / proof of concept and I've only enabled it for 
my own public-inbox list for now but yeah, it's here:

gemini://lists.grizzlybear.site/

Or direct link to the public mailing list:

gemini://lists.grizzlybear.site/~supergrizzlybear/public-inbox

You're right, the situation right now is not ideal.  But there are some
alternative solutions.  For example, I'm using Uberspace, which is a
pretty cheap hosting platform.  E-mails from my Uberspace address are
generally accepted by Google and the like.  ProtonMail is also pretty
good (but you'll want emersion's hydroxide for IMAP/SMTP on free plans).

You could probably crawl through all the addresses on this mailing list
and find some suitable domains - I just did so for the last 2011 e-mails
on this list, with the following domains and counts of e-mail addresses:

```
$ mlist us/list/gemini | mseq -S
$ mhdr -h To:Cc -A : |
    sed -e 's/^.* <\(.*\)>$/\1/' -e 's/^\(.*\)@\(.*\)$/\2 \1/' |
    sort -u |
    awk 'BEG{p="";c=0}{if(p==$1){c++}else{if (length(p))print c,p;p=$1;c=1}}END{print c,p}' |

IMO they should decode all characters allowed in that section of the
URL. For example, a %2f wouldn't be decoded, because it would split
the path segment. %61 would, because it decodes to "a", which is
allowed and wouldn't change the meaning. The Chrome (Might actually be
V8, idk) and Firefox URL parsers do this for HTTP(S), but not other
protocols.
I think this makes sense because it makes a single normalized form,
and allows for files with special characters in their names. I'm not
sure how servers would handle filenames with slashes in them, though.

Right now, it's quite the opposite.  Google & Yahoo & Microsoft & co.
control the vast majority of email addresses.  Also, they don't like
emails sent from dynamic ips.  Try to setup a mail server nowadays.  I
have, but my internet provider gives me a dynamic ip. Fine? Nope, my
mail is blocked by 90% of providers, even if my setup is correct and my
score on [1] is excellent, google refuses to accept my emails.   So here
I am, sending a mail from a google account.  Email was decentralized,
now it is not.  But if you can prove me wrong (host a mail server with a
dynamic ip and being able to send emails to anybody) please do, I'd
really like to ditch google mail.

Yahoo? Is it a thing? In 2020?

You are conflating various underlying causes.

> Also, they don't like emails sent from dynamic ips.

Must email traffic is spam. And most of the work is to filter out spam.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/420391/spam-email-traffic-share/

Therefore the challenge of using a random residential address to do anything. No one will trust you. Rightly so, as most of them are compromised.

The challanges of setting up your own email infrastructure lies there: trust.

https://www.spamhaus.org/organization/

On the other hand, one could totally setup an alt-mail service, old-school, perhaps peer-to-peer, among friends and family.

Just don't expect the rest of the world to interact with it.

I agree with the principle here, but there's another aspect to the
back-and-forth.

Mailing lists and NNTP are, of course, the correct protocols for fora or
message boards. But I think what people want here is different. Gemlog
posts are standalone documents that you put out into the world to read.
It's a wonderful part of community that people write gemlogs in response
to other gemlogs; it's very similar to the early blogging community
before it became focused on monetization, and then crowded out by social
media.

What people want in this case, I think, is not so much a direct analogue
of a forum, but a way of collecting and following the set of gemlog
posts responding to each other, but also get notification when your own
posts are replied to. Maybe this set of conventions for apps may look
too forum-like, but it is a good suggestion for an approach to the
question of doing that kind of notifications without trying to do a
POST-equivalent over Gemini.

I used to run my own mail server* (the domain picked up in the following messages with listed domains - is mmn.name).? My ISP issues static IPs but honestly, that doesn't change the arbitrary blocking from the big providers.

However, you can use a smarthost while still hosting your own server(s).? Personally I use spamhero.com to manage in and outbound emails, and block off my mail server ports only to their IPs, it's a bit more expensive at 15$ a month.

If you just want SMTP relay, then duocircle (https://www.duocircle.com/email/outbound-smtp) is free for 1 000 messages a month or 4$ for 2 500.? I've probably max sent 1 500 emails in a month at a peak, it's surprisingly hard.

There is, of course, your ISP's SMTP server, but that's a gamble, my ISP is geared towards advanced users hosting their own services so there isn't any weird restrictions on sender domains. Whereas other ISPs are more anti-that and will probably make every effort to ruin your life by blocking domains that are not their crap email domain.

It's kind of cheating the self hosted ethos, but it at least means you guarantee delivery.

= the server crashed for good and I was too lazy to fix it.? I still kind of do as my BBS is up and running and does still have to send and receive internet email.

I understand what you mean, but to be honest, I don't have a solution to
that.  I can't think of a way of bringing that feeling that you've
described to a system that properly manages replies, because I think a
fundamental part of that feeling is that the posts-in-reply are actually
disconnected, and on another person's site.  A system that notifies you
(e.g. via e-mail) that you've got replies seems to destroy that feeling,
partly I think because it's too similar to the social media that have
taken over the world.  Maybe it's different for you.

On the other hand, I have another idea for the mailing list / forum
system I talked about: introduce self-hosted mail servers where only you
can introduce new (i.e. not in reply to anything) mails.  Publishing a
new post is equivalent to sending it to the server, from where anyone
subscribed will get it.  And on top of that mail server would be a
Gemini interface.  One could introduce someone else's post (and the
entire associated reply set) into their own mailing list to "boost" it
like in Mastodon, or to just include their replies to it in their own
list.  It sounds like fun to write - I'll get to it (the Gemini side;
there are already enough mail servers) when I can, but (anyone) feel
free to have a go.

In https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/003299.html an idea 
was that servers track client referers to present those referers to the 
next visitors, but we do not have referers for very good reasons.

Sketching out the idea nevertheless ... 
* Interesting post b on server :b
* Triggers person C to post her thoughts c on server :c with a link to b
* Poster C visits post b via her own link from post c to post b
* Server :b logs this referer, ie the URL of post c
* On following visits of post b, server :b lists the logged referers 
* Server :b could pre-fetch refering content to check for appropriate
  content, eg containing "## Re: " or "=> [own URL]"

Alternatively webrings were proposed, which does seem like the correct 
Gemini way of doing it, though.

If we unescape all of the RFC 2396 unreserved characters, we get
"../R%3A%20A%2FB%201%25%20%40%20%243;%3Bv%3D1" (my reference to RFC 2616
was erroneous).  RFC 3986 makes a lot of concessions to WHATWG, and
requires the %2E%2E to be left alone, which changes resolution.  IMO Gemini
should stick with 2396 on this and a number of other points.

RFC 2396 doesn't actually allow an unescaped trailing slash in the
pathname, although RFC 3986 does.  If that is removed, then there there are
no escaped reserved characters, so this is equivalent to "gemini://
example.com/foo/bar%3B3/".  Normal URI resolution then gives us "gemini://
example.com/foo/R%3A%20A%2FB%201%25%20%40%20%243;%3Bv%3D1", which is what
should be sent to the server.  Exactly how, if at all, the last component
of the path is translated into a file on the filesystem is completely up to
the server.

That's my best shot.

I think XMPP's PubSub spec would be a great way to do this. Movim.eu
built an entire social networking platform on top of this. Not
everyone uses XMPP though, unlike email.

I think a public inbox to collect responses is the neatest way to
do this through email, at least the simplest. . You could just run
a script to parse the posts to the lists, optionally convert them
ti gemtext, and generate an index of all the responses.

I think someone recently posted something like this to the list
(or maybe it was another, or a dream! I'm to sleep deprived to tell!)

Message-ID: <20210109084403.ogk2oxix7rt4ziiv@softwarelibre.nl>

Hi,

org-static-gemlog is a simple org-mode based static gemlog generator
based on Bastian Bechtold's org-static-blog, adapted for Gemini.

Source and instructions can be found at https://git.sr.ht/~avr/org-static-gemlog

Even though it's easy to manually write gemtext posts (maybe easier than org-mode
if you're not already using it), org-static-gemlog maintains tag files to make
it easier to find other posts with the same tag.

It also automaticaly maintains and updates an rss feed and creates an index.gmi.

If you're aready using emacs, or even org-mode, org-static-gemlog might provide
you with an easier workflow in publishing your gemlog.

	cheers,
	Andreas

This has been solved on the WWW through Webmentions. It should be 
possible to bring this to a Gemini site, though perhaps not using the 
Gemini protocol.

Currently, if Alice writes a (micro)blog post responding to Bob's post, 
Bob can get a notification or display Alice's response as a comment 
under his post automatically. The result is something that can replace 
silos like social media; everyone owns their own sites and talks to each 
other, posting and repeating like Twitter or the various Fediverse 
microblogging implementations.

To bring this to Gemini, Webmention software could simply handle 
Webmentions with gemini:// URLs. The sending of Webmentions could be 
done over HTTP, but the verification of Webmentions sent using gemini:// 
will obviously use the Gemini protocol.

I'll be working on something like ddevault's openring 
(https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/openring/), but for saved Webmentions instead 
of RSS feeds; I'll probably include an option for Gemtext output as well 
as HTML.

Also, to add to my last response:

Mailing lists also don't need to compete with alternatives, like my 
aforementioned Webmention-based approach. If mailing list entries are 
displayed alongside Webmentions or Webmentions get forwarded to the 
mailing list, then we automatically get the best of both worlds.

Hi

> Whoops, missed "From" (thus missing mails never replied to).  Adding it
> in, we get:

Just to a quick note of appreciation for your
effort to actually do the analysis.

My (very rough) summary gives the following
breakdown:

gmail                               28
other commercial providers          17
domains with more than one sender   30
domains with one sender            134 (yay!)

I have now seen the argument:

  "everybody uses gmail thesdays, sad, but you can't change that"

on a number of mailing lists and it is really
neat to see that this does not have to be the
case.

I have two observations to make:

Loads of people who have been on the internet for
some decades remember the good old days fondly,
and are sad at what the internet (well, mainly web)
has turned in to. My view is that the good parts
of the internet are still there and are better than
ever - it is just that the good parts are completely
dwarfed by the amount of rubbish that is being added
even more quickly.

So this is my theory of internet inflation (similar
to cosmic inflation):

 "The bright stuff that matters is still there, but the
  vacuous stuff (vacuum) in between is growing and
  making the good stuff hard to find."

And I consider this list one of the bright points on
the internet, amongst the darkness of all the facebooglegram.

Then the second observation relates to the protocol discussions
here: A while ago some beginner woodworking article had
the (paraphrased) line in it:

 "To get started, we recommend making your own workbench. And if
  you are thinking of buying a workbench, reconsider if woodworking
  is really for you"

So at the risk of being a elitist, I tend to take comments
on protocol nuances and extensions a lot more seriously
from a selfhosted email address, on the basis that the
poster has some form of experience/expertise relating to
running an internet facing service.

regards

marc

Two privacy-related suggestions:


# Only send client certificates over TLS 1.3

TLS 1.3 encrypts client certs, TLS 1.2 doesn't.  On 1.2 your ISP might see the user you log in as, your e-mail address and whatever other information you (are required to) put in the cert.  Please consider only allowing client certificates over TLS 1.3 (and newer).


# No OCSP requests

The spec says:

> Clients can validate TLS connections however they like

As long as CA-based validation is allowed in Gemini, consider adding an exception along the lines of "Thou shalt not make OCSP requests", as they are notoriously bad for privacy, add latency and are easy to block by attackers.

I am loath to raise these kinds of things, as it just creates more work, 
but if you're taking requests:

Clarify whether gemini://host.domain/path and 
gemini://host.domain:1965/path are to be considered equivalent, and if 
so, what that means. (This may 
be more important for the robots.txt side-spec).

This is outside of Gemini's specification remit, but yes, they are equivalent.

The current assumptions are wholly incoherent. 

The interaction between TOFU and X.509, if any, must be thought through clearly.

This is not even half-baked. It's not baked at all.

  I ran my own analysys over the addresses to the mailing list (starting
from the start, August 14, 2019) and got the following:

	Total unique addresses;		334
	Total unique domains:		225
	Domains that use Google:	 20 *
	Domains use a single MX host:	162 **

	*  Includes gmail.com and other domains that outsource email to
	   Google.
	** Only counted domains with 1 MX record, most likely self-hosted.

  I don't think this means that everybody on this list uses gmail, but it's
probably more than expected.

Yes, they are equivalent. RFC 3986
<gemini://gemini.bortzmeyer.org/rfc-mirror/rfc3986.txt>, section
3.2.3:

   A scheme may define a default port.  For example, the "http" scheme
   defines a default port of "80", corresponding to its reserved TCP
   port number. [...]  URI producers and normalizers should omit the
   port component and its ":" delimiter if port is empty or if its
   value would be the same as that of the scheme's default.

For instance, the Lupa crawler
<gemini://gemini.bortzmeyer.org/software/lupa/> canonicalizes
<gemini://host.example:1965/path> to <gemini://host.example/path>.

% lupa-insert-url gemini://host.example:1965/path

% my-lupa-insert-url gemini://host.example/path

Gmail is rather convenient for public forums, a bit like a burner phone for robocalls.

I'm not writing a client right now, but if I was, I think I would
handle certs a few different ways. First, if it was tunneled over a
protocol that is already encrypted (ex. Tor), I'd accept any
certificate, because TLS would be redundant, even though the spec
requires it. If the certificate was valid and trusted by the CAs
installed, I would also accept it, even if that means overwriting an
earlier TOFU entry. Otherwise, I would handle them like SSH handles
keys, by asking the user on the first connection if the certificate is
trusted. Hopefully blockchain-based naming systems will make cert
validation easy some day, as you could just check if the cert matches
the signature in the blockchain of the person who owns the domain.

Good point. I actually do that over wireguard -using old school ident at time- LAN type ala tailscale ?. No point for TLS in such setup.

It was suggested to move TLS outside of the core protocol (i.e. gemini+plain), and precisely define TLS as a Gemini "profile", i.e. gemini+tls.

No traction :P

This is all sounds rather reasonable. 

The part I don't really like personally is the mixed metaphor of ( TOFU + X.509 ) = ?

Using multiaddr notation ?:

This is really a very nice design.  Here's my attempt to adapt it to Gemini:

1) Alice mentions Bob's post in a text/gemini document by posting her
response containing a link line to it.

2) Alice (or a tool that Alice uses) fetches Bob's post and scans it for a
link line whose text is (or contains) "Webmentions".  If there isn't one,
Alice can't proceed.  We'll call this the linkage URL.  It can be absolute
or relative but can't contain a fragment.

3) Otherwise, Alice takes the linkage URL and appends
"source=url1&target=url2" to it in the usual way.  That is, prefixed by "?"
if there is no query part already, or prefixed by & if there is.  Url1 is
Alice's post and url2 is Bob's post.  There is no need to %-escape either
of them.  Note that this use of parameters is specific to linkage servers.

4) Alice then makes a Gemini request to the extended linkage URL.  A 20
response means success, but Alice doesn't have to care what is returned
(perhaps an empty document or something human readable).  The server
referenced in the linkage URL, which we will call the linkage server,
queues up the request for offline processing.  This is important, as it
makes DDOSing more or less useless.

5) Alice can then do the same thing for all the other links in her post,
and then she doesn't have to worry about it any more.

6) At some future time, the linkage server referred to in Bob's post
dequeues a request:

6a) The server does some simple validation (url1 must be different from
url2, neither url must be "localhost", etc.) and makes sure that url2 is a
resource for which it is willing to accept requests.  If any of this fails,
the request is dropped.

6b) The server makes sure that it hasn't seen this request before (if so,
it drops it).

6c) The server fetches Alice's post at url1 to make sure it really does
contain a link line that points to url2.  If it gets an error other than
52, it can (but doesn't have to) queue up the request to try again.  A 52
GONE request means don't try again, as Alice has deleted the post.

7) Exactly what happens next depends on how the linkage server works.

7a) The linkage server may notify Bob by email saying "Your post <url2> has
been linked from a post at <url1>.

7b) If the linkage server has read/write access to Bob's post (through the
file system, for example, or via sftp), it may create a link line to
Alice's post using the first "#" header line in Alice's post as the link
text, and append that line to Bob's post under a header line saying "#
Responses".  This would leave a permanent record that anyone reading Bob's
post can see.

7c) Or the linkage server can do (as they say on Monty Python) something
completely different.

8)  If  Alice updates the post, she can repeat the process for any newly
added links.

9) More advanced client tools and linkage servers can cope with media types
other than text/gemini:

9a) If Bob's post is text/plain, it can be checked for a line saying
"Webmentions: " followed by an URL; if Alice's post is text/plain, its body
can be searched for url2.

9b) If Bob's post is text/html, it can be checked for a link or a element
whose rel attribute is "webmention"; if Alice's post is text/html, it can
be checked for a link, a, src, or video element whose href  or src
attribute is url2.

9c) Linkage servers can be smarter and handle schemes other than gemini,
such as http(s), in which case they should follow <
https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/>, or gopher, or whatever.

A nice thing about this design is that Alice and Bob can do everything
pretty much by hand.  Alice has to be careful to construct the right URL,
but if she messes up, nothing very bad happens.  The linkage server is the
only part that has to be smart, and even then it is not all that smart.
Queueing up requests can be done by writing each one to a small file in a
directory, and they can be dequeued by reading a file from the directory
and unlinking it when it is processed.  Alternatively the Posix batch(1)
command can be used to run a command that processes one request.

It seems a reasonable choice. (Except that "asking the user [...] if
the certificate is trusted" is just playing with words: unlike SSH,
the user has zero knowledge of the remote server and cannot assess the
certificate.) I like the way it deals with the coexistence X.509/TOFU.

Depending on how the client and the server are ran, they may not know
if they use Tor or not. Think socks and stuff like that.

Message-ID: <CADkMQxWL6qnkd6-y2WAXaJp7HBWO286pjZ2v7BZvXvx-iSjC6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I'm happy to announce Twinq, a new, graphical, Gemini browser:

=> https://git.sr.ht/~bendb/twinq

It requires Qt6, cmake, and a modern c++ compiler, but no other
dependencies.  It's easy on the eyes (the content, anyways), and the
browsing/TOFU/protocol experience is pretty stable.  We don't yet have
features like bookmarks, home pages, etc - will get to those soon enough.

Eventually we'll have installers for precompiled binaries, but for now one
must build from sources.

The goals for Twinq are
- to be lightweight (well, as lightweight as any Qt app can be :) )
- to have a simple implementation
- to be portable

It's reasonably successful at these goals, save portability - I've only run
it on linux.  Who knows what's in store on other platforms!  I'm hopeful to
hear from one of you on that front.

Cheers,
Ben

I am a Linux user (Manjaro). After installing qt6 (several hundred 
megs), it built very easily.

I like the TOFU popup. And it built very fast. Overall, nice work. Good 
to see a qt6 project.

Hi!

I wrote a Firefox addon for enabling the Gemini protocol. It's dead simple: it just redirects gemini:// URLs & links to a HTTP-to-Gemini proxy (similar to OverbiteWX for Gopher). By default it uses one of the two public proxies, but it can be configured to use a custom one.

Hello there

Many thanks for that - this is a great guide for anyone wanting to set 
up a server in the cloud, and the Oracle offering seems quite generous. 
I've tried it out today and I can confirm the steps are very well 
described and it works fine.

But I found a couple of small bugs in your guide that you might want to fix:

1. Opening the VCN firewall,

Guide says: "Enter "1935" in the "Destination Port Range" input box"

This should be port 1965 not 1935 (typo)

2. SSH'ing into your Ubuntu instance and updating it

Connecting with PuTTY - need to use PuttyGen to import private PEM and 
generate ppk file. I couldnt get PuTTY to directly use the PEM files.

3. Setting up iptables

Guide says to use: sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

I got "permission denied" with that command

Instead this worked for me: sudo iptables-save -f /etc/iptables/rules.v4

Many thanks again - now I have another space to play in.

  - Luke

I love reading about people (ab)using the free tiers of <insert cloud
service provider> to do their hosting. Obviously a gemini server will
fit easily on any free tier, but I remember having fun a few times
engineering my software to pretty much max out my usage of aws' free
tier so I could get the most bang for my nonexistent buck.

I am surprised that oracle has the best offering though, do you think
they just want to try to attract customers? I never really considered
oracle to be the generous type.

Message-ID: <CAFwUW90jCW+rVrtZwZuge5PfyJx14h8wu2vU0TdqGocB6vYE-g@mail.gmail.com>

Good evening!

I feel like the last time I asked a question there were great responses and
I have another question where I'm hoping to learn how others would approach
it.

I'm wrapping up work on a Gemini client and planning on producing builds
for Linux/Darwin/Windows. (32-bit and 64-bit... which I think(?) is
standard...)

When I test the Windows binary executable there are several warning dialogs
that pop up talking about how the exe hasn't been signed and is unknown and
might be best to not let run. I think that Code Signing certificates and
signing the binary are the generally recommended approach to overcome that.

I looked into Code Signing certificates and I found some that seem like
they'd work for the Windows builds (from the little that I know... all I
need is something called a Code Signing certificate... I don't *think*
there's any OS-specific aspect), but they're $100/yr. Not horrible, but
certainly more than expected. In my ignorance it feels odd that there's
nothing like LetsEncrypt for Code Signing certificates.

So the question is this: If you were producing a stand-alone binary
executable meant to run on Windows and you wanted to minimize the install
friction (like not having the warnings described above), how would you
approach that?

One solution: I could just hope that users would be willing and/or able to
ignore the warnings and install it anyway. Keeps costs down... keeps build
process simple. Might not have as much adoption as hoped.

Another solution: Pay the yearly fee, sign the builds, avoid the warnings.
(I'm also not sure how the certificate will verify I'm trustworthy when I'm
not so certain I want any personally identifiable information to be shared
with whoever will be running me through whatever process - I dream of
something simple like a dns cname record to prove ownership and the cert
then saying the builds were produced by the owner of the domain... or
something...).

Third option: On the side, I've also written a modified HTTP/HTML server to
use a gemini client and make it super easy to browse Gemini space *without*
installing a client, but I'm reluctant to have feature-parity between that
browser-based client and this standalone binary client. I could just go
with, "Install the unsigned client if you want and if you're uncomfortable
with that feel free to use the browser-based one, but you're missing out if
you don't install the standalone one".

Thoughts?

No "native" Gemini add-on for Firefox? I don't find one in
<gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/software/> at the "Browser plugins"
entry [side note: for this sort of things, fragments in URI
<gemini://gemini.bortzmeyer.org/gemini/fragment.gmi> could be
useful]. But I do not see yours either, I assume this list is
maintained with some delay.

I went down a similar route for my own native windows gemini client. In 
my experience some anti-virus products can be quite aggressive to 
"protect" the end user from unknown apps as well as ones known to be 
malicious. Basically the anti-virus apps give an unknown app a score 
based on a number of factors, such as:

 ?- is it signed with a non-self-signed certificate

 ?- is the app "well known" - (size of existing user base)

 ?- does the app want to do anything "risky" (like access a server on an 
infrequently used obscure port, say 70 or 1965) or use privileged APIs

 ?- does the app include any libraries or source used by other malicious 
apps

So for something like a gemini client, quite a few of these can trigger 
warning flags.

Yes, why not start out like this to get some feedback, but eventually 
your users will complain that they cannot easily install it. Most end 
users will be uncomfortable with fishing an app out of quarantine and 
marking it as "safe" against the advice of their AV, even if it is a 
false positive.

So I think you'll need to go down the route of looking into getting a 
certificate at some point. It is somewhat frustrating to have to battle 
these self appointed gatekeepers, but...

It's frustrating, but I think this is probably needed if you want 
adoption beyond a few early adopters. I can recommend Certum who have an 
"open source developer" certificate pack available for a not huge fee.

Definitely get the users to come onto Gemini - it is quieter and calmer

You simply can't write a "native" Gemini add-on. Mozillas dweb project
(which would have enabled you to build protocols other than http into
the browser as an add-on) is dead in the water, everybody who had been
working on it does not work at Mozilla anymore and the bug tracker
status is like "we aren't really interested, maybe, if you write it
yourself, we might accept it into the Firefox codebase".
Only upside is that Chromium does not do much better.

Hello! Announcing my personal gemini capsule. Been following a direct
transposal of my pt-br posts on my blog to gemini. As soon as I start to
translate my blog posts to english, will add as well to the capsule.
I write mostly about free software movement, programming, politics, etc.

Been happily running satellite as the server backend. I'm also open to
host more capsules on gemini.eletrotupi.com.

gemini://gemini.eletrotupi.com/~porcellis/index.gmi

Will add a RSS feed and somewhere down the line, host a CAPCOM for other
languages if I find other people writing from Latin America. 

See you on the gemini space!

The whole point of a cert is to prove your identity to someone who will do
something for you (or allow you to do something to them) based on it.
Consider these real-life examples.

I go to my pharmacy to pick up my prescription medicines.  The meds are
only for me, so only I can pick them up.

Case 0: personal knowledge

Me: Hi there.  Can you give my meds please?

Clerk: Oh, hello, Mr. Cowan.  Nice to see you again.  Here you go.

Case 1: self-signed cert

Me: Hi there.  I'm John Cowan, and I want to pick up my medicines.

Clerk (who doesn't know me):  Can I see some identification, please?

I hand over a piece of paper.

Clerk: Umm, this says you are John Cowan, all right, but it's only signed
by you.  This doesn't prove a thing.  ...Next customer, please?

Case 2: anonymous cert

As in Case 1 until the clerk looks at the letter.

Clerk: This says "The bearer of this document is known to me as 'Joe
Nameless'.  Signed A. Nonny Mouse, Chief Identifier, Fly-by-night
Corporation."  I'm sorry, this doesn't help: the name on this paper doesn't
match your name.

Me:  Well, of course not!  I wasn't going to give Fly-by-night my
personally identifying information!

Clerk:  Sorry ... next customer, please?

Case 3: CA-based cert

Same as Cases 1 and 2 until the clerk looks at the letter (actually a card
this time).

Clerk:  Okay, this says that the State of New York, which we trust, has
verified your identity as John Cowan.  Hello, Mr. Cowan.  Here you go.

Perhaps it might be worth setting up a little collective for Windows Gemini devs and purchase a signing cert as a group for group members clients / servers.? It'll be a bit cheaper en masse and make it easier for newer Geminautes on Windows to dive in without Windows trying to stomp on their day because coin wasn't paid to Micro$oft.

I'm not saying play the system, but you know, sometimes you just got to improvise the rules :D

Since we have no list tag for operational issues, I guess that [tech]

The capsule gemini.marmaladefoo.com has a funny
redirection. <gemini://gemini.marmaladefoo.com/geminaut?name=gerald>
redirects to <gemini://gemini.marmaladefoo.com/geminaut?name=gerald/>
which redirects to
<gemini://gemini.marmaladefoo.com/geminaut?name=gerald//> and so on
until you run out of slashes :-)

May be it will reactivate the discussion on a way to get the contact

Hmm - there is something strange about that URL - it might be molly 
brown redirecting. I'll investigate.

But anyway, the URL is not a valid one - were you just playing around or 
did you follow a link from somewhere that linked to that URL?

There is a CGI demo here

gemini://gemini.marmaladefoo.com/cgi-bin/hello-world.cgi where you can 
put your name, e.g.

gemini://gemini.marmaladefoo.com/cgi-bin/hello-world.cgi?name=gerald

Yes - it seems to be a molly brown bug.

If you take a valid URL that references a folder not having a trailing 
slash, and add a query to it, molly brown goes off on an endless redirect.

For example, try this one:

gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/capcom?foo

1. Here the "capcom" folder exists with an index.gmi therein
2. Molly brown thereby puts a slash on the end of the URL, but what it 
should do is put a slash after the capcom maybe, thus

gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/capcom/?foo

not

gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/capcom?foo/

in this second case, molly brown will redirect again to


gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/capcom?foo//

and so on.

I'll let solderpunk know.

In the mean time, I suggest not to construct strange parameterised URLs 
to folder URLs on molly brown!

Saluton!

I was inspired by gmisub (many thanks to Callum for helping me get it 
working on FreeBSD) to create my own feed with a special purpose. It 
occurred to me that there are several users on Gemini who know Esperanto 
but don't often write in it (including myself). I thought this could 
change if I propose that we create gemlogs specific to that language and 
put them into a single feed so we can easily read each other:

gemini://kwiecien.us/efluo.gmi

Everyone/anyone is welcome to participate. The logs have to be in a 
format compatible with gmisub, which I'm sure everybody knows by now.

I would also like to propose an initiative to do this for other 
languages to help their communities gain momentum. For example, I have 
recently seen posts in French on Gemini. I would be willing to host such 
feeds or teach volunteers how.

Amike,
Ben

For client authors, there is also the recommendation in the Gemini "best 
practices" doc to not automatically follow more than N (suggested N=5) 
redirects. This would prevent getting stuck in any intentional or 
inadvertent redirect tar pits that await.

I think there is are some intentional infinite redirect loops in the 
client torture tests as well as the usual inadvertent server or CGI bugs 
out in the geminiverse.

This is Miguel de Luis, hailing from Canary Islands, Spain and this is my little gemini capsule gemini://enteka.xyz which uses the Glasgow-php server. Mostly because php was already installed in the server and it worked nicely.

My content is mostly in Spanish, though and it's still a very humble thing, but I hope to be a little bleep in the Gemini space, at least.

## Questions:

*  As for file extensions, I'm using .gemini but I see many people prefering .gmi  Should I change to .gmi? Are there any rules I'm not aware of?

* Do Gemini capsules use the same Atom feed format as other. I tried to make my own feed but I got a validation error telling me the gemini protocol was not registered at (some acronym IAPA or something?)

* Is there a Gemini-aware feed format?

Well, thanks everyone. To this point the best in Gemini has been the people I've met.

Welcome to geminispace!  Unfortunately my Spanish isn't too good but
maybe reading more Spanish gemini content will help me learn better!

I don't think it matters.  .gemini seems to be falling out of
popularity, but everything I've come across understands it so it's fine
I'd say.  Looking at your server, your most recent post with a .gmi
extension (gemini://enteka.xyz/sonriePalea.gmi) is sent with a mime type
of text/plain, so I actually think your server doesn't recognize the
.gmi extension.

You'll get a validation error for atom, I just ignored it as the rest of
my feed was fine.  If an aggregator can access content on gemini it
knows about the gemini protocol and isn't relying on a hardcoded list of
registered schemes.

I know there's plans to get the gemini scheme (the "gemini:" part at the
beginning of URLs) registered with the IANA, but nothing has happened so
far.

> * Is there a Gemini-aware feed format?
There is!  It's a ?companion specification,? see this page:
gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/companion/subscription.gmi

Looking at your site, your homepage is already compatible with gemini
feeds, so you're all set on that front.

For french content I host gemini://fran?ais.lanterne.chilliet.eu/ which lists french capsules I?ve found.

Also if people are interested I can host a GAMS board in french.

Your esperanto capsule is not setting lang parameter in the mimetype header, it would be better to add lang=eo to the meta line. It will help find esperanto content if search engines start using this information.

Well, you never know. My first "real" English book was a Fighting Fantasy

Yep, I think you are right. Renamed it to .gemini and it's now displaying

Thank you, Alex, I'm sticking to the Gemini comanion specification then. 
It might be less popular, but I do feel it makes more sense for Gemini.

When I first started using Markdown, I was a diehard fan of using the full extension, .markdown. .md seemed like a stupid hack that was good only for long-dead Windows 3.1 computers.

Then I started seeing lots of my own .markdown files in a length-constrained view (probably the Visual Studio Code sidebar) and thought ??.markdown? takes up a half to a third of the space in this view, but it doesn?t tell me anything more about the file than .md would. If I renamed all these files to .md, I?d get much better information density and less noise.?

I use .md now.

All this happened before I got into Gemini, so I started off with .gmi and only briefly considered using the full extension.

The simplicity of gemini is what sold me on doing it this way -- even these dated servers I can't imagine maxing this out. May still try to run a matrix server concurrently or just on the second VM to maximize my return on investment.

100%, it's just a marketing ploy. They have such a low marketshare (I think they're the smallest "major" player?) that I'm sure this is absolutely just a way to draw people in. I'm sure there will be a catch down the line at some point -- after all, nothing's more expensive than a free gift.

Nonetheless, two free VMs is pretty dope.

Waveic,

That depends on how you define native. If you ship an add-on that uses
"native messaging"[1] to talk to a companion app (such as a console python
script), then you can have the companion app do the gemini protocol dance
and send the data back to Firefox.

What sucks is that you can't have the add-on install the native companion
app for obvious security reasons, but if you can convince your user to run
an installer, then it is all very easy. When I was developing some SSB
add-on toys for Firefox, I initially used this approach and it worked fine.
Later I started using WebSockets to talk to the SSB server instead which
was much easier for the user. Still, using native messaging works, and it
works across platforms and across browsers. Oh, an in the subject of
add-ons, I vaguelly remember something about  Brave is exposing sockets to
add-on developers, you might want to check it out.

I'm sad about libdweb as well. I was one of the contributors. It had so
much potential, Mozilla totally dropped the ball.

Hello,
following the announcement of the #gemini-italia IRC channel, I'm happy to announce the recent launch of a new capsule at gemini://gemini.iosa.it/

It runs on Agate and it's written entirely in Italian, both as a much needed relief to my irregular writing habits and to encourage others to write in their own (native or preferred) language in the same vein as other capsules in Spanish, French and Esperanto.

Thank you,
steko

A new project from Nadim? Interesting.

Anyway, I think it?s okay since it?s mostly a jargon term used by users
rather than the name of a core element of the protocol. I would be more
worried if it was named Gemini Protocol ahahah.

I went head and created a feed that contains all four. I made 
preparations for a separate feed for each language, but since I only had 
one site per language I just made it one feed:

gemini://kwiecien.us/latinx.gmi

I realize we probably can't read each other's languages. ^^ I thought it 
was cool anyway!

Nice, I want to add my capsule there as well. Still need to write the
atom feed first though, which I will do later this week. Really cool

There are too many things called Gemini, it's a bit too much confusing for newcomers.

I am using gmisub, so Atom is not necessary. The gemlog just has to be a 
specific format, particularly with the dates on the links and having a 
title heading on the page.

You can send me a link your capsule and I will check it.

How would that be different from a regular Gemini-to-Web proxy that runs
locally?

One thing that I like about HTTP is that there are oodles of ways to spin up a simple server for testing on localhost. Things like `python3 -m http.server` and `caddy run` are what I'm thinking of. Since this is Gemini and not bare-bones HTTP, It'd have to handle key generation.

Is there a server like that yet for Gemini that runs on macOS?

I'm writing a server that almost fit in that description, I was thinking
to share it with the list when I'll finish the vhost and configuration
stuff I was working on, but anyway.

It's called gmid[0][1].  It doesn't (yet) handle the creation of keys,
but you can easily generate a cert and store, say, in you home and
you're done.  Once you've built it, you can serve any directory with
`gmid -c cert.pem -k key.pem -d dir` [2].  Ctrl-c when you're done :)

(I'm also using it to serve my capsule)

It's written in C, sandboxed by default (from the next version) on
OpenBSD, FreeBSD and linux, and with LibreSSL/libretls as only
dependency.  You'll also need lex and yacc/bison to build.  I don't have
a mac, but I don't see why it shouldn't run fine there.

Cheers,

Omar Polo

Hi,

Jetforce was somewhat designed to fill that niche [0]. It has
automatic certificate generation and no config file to mess around
with.

python3 -m pip install jetforce
python3 -m jetforce --dir .

John,

That would be different in the sense that you'd have more access to the
browser features for integration purposes. For example, you could intercept
"gemini://" URLs, you could (provide an) override to the "new tab" page to
list gemini aggregators, you could add a bookmarking system. You could
inspect <meta> tags on a page to see if they have a "gemini url" declared
and provide a page action to read using "gemini" instead. There are many
things you can do with an add-on that you can't do with a local webservice.

Best
A

Subject: [spec] nitpicking
Message-ID: <87mtx3lg5j.fsf@omarpolo.com>

Hello,

I was re-reading the spec to clarify I doubt I had about relative vs
absolute URLs and where they're allowed, while I stumbled on this part:

> 2 Gemini Request
> [...]
> <URL> is a UTF-8 encoded absolute URL, including a scheme, of maximum length

> Sending an absolute URL instead of only a path or selector is effectively

If I'm understanding correctly, the "instead of only a path or selector"
is redundant, since relative URLs aren't allowed.  This is probably a
leftover from when the spec allowed both relative and absolute URLs in
the request, or I'm missing something?

Thanks,

Omar Polo

I think it is meant to emphasize that this is how Gemini does virtual
hosting (and also proxying), rather than a combination of a relative
reference in the GET line and a Host: header, as HTTP/1.1 does.  So this
sentence is informative rather than normative.

Just wanted to point that out. I've been recently downloaded this deedum app and it's amazing how much better gemini works on android. It is fast, to the point and just works great.

I even consider Gemini could be a great way to offer public service content, specially on areas where a mobile connection is all you have but it's not that great.

Your interpretation seems right.  I initially read it from the
prospective of someone who knew relative URLs were allowed, not as
someone approaching a new protocol.

If you are a Lispnik, feel free to check out Space Age (The Clojurian's
Gemini Server):

  https://gitlab.com/lambdatronic/space-age

Since Clojure compiles to Java bytecode, it's fully cross-platform. You
just need to install a recent JDK and the Clojure command line tool. Key
generation is handled with a single command, which is documented in the
project's README.

You can then launch Space Age with the following command:

$ clojure -M:run-server .

That will serve up the current directory and anything within it on port
1965. To serve up a different directory, just replace "." with the
directory path.

Uniquely among Gemini servers, Space Age provides a form of server-side
application programming modeled after Clojure's de facto web programming
standard, Ring, but further simplified for Geminispace.

Essentially, dynamic routes can be programmed as simple functions that
take a request map and return a response map. All you have to do is add
a *.clj file anywhere under your document root (or under a user's
/home/username/public_gemini directory), make it executable, and define
a main function within it that will be called whenever that page is
requested by a Gemini client.

So rather than messing with environment variables and printing to
stdout, you can just write pure functions that take and receive data.
Fun times for functional programmers of all ages!

Personally, I test locally with agate, since I can easily run it with 
flags and no config files:

https://github.com/mbrubeck/agate

I used to run it on my server as well, but I switch to gmnisrv for the 
better logging.

As a bonus, you can build both as statically-linked binaries.

IDK how good macOS support is for either of them.

  I wouldn't say it's unique, just rare.  GLV-1.12556 [1] is also easy to expand
but instead of looking for executable scripts [2], it uses Lua's module
system.  These modules [3] used to return the data as Space-Age, but I
switched to a streaming model to save memory usage [4].

Thanks for the tip, Sean. I hadn't realized you had also used a
functional programming model for your Lua CGI scripts.

Always something new to learn,

This time it's a short question that I can't find an answer to.

Why not use '.gem' as the file extension? Why the encouragement to support
one or both of gmi / gemini instead of adding a new one?

What I was able to find was, "Current Gemini servers seem to use .gmi or
.gemini extensions for this purpose, and new servers are strongly
encouraged to support one or both of these options instead of adding a new
one to the mix." (from gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/best-practices.gmi)

To be clear: You won't get any argument from me. The only thing swaying me
either way is, to me, '.gem' feels cooler. I'd *really* love to use that...
I'd feel... almost sad to use gmi... and gemini is annoyingly long. So. No
logical argument here. Just looking for some background and trying to get a
feel for how horrible a person I'd be if I went with gem.

Thoughts?

.gem is for Ruby gem files (sort of libraries)

  Go for it.  Just make sure the server you use can be configured to use
.gem as the extension.  Clients don't care about extensions because the MIME
type is returned.

You can use whatever extension you want, or no extension, as long as
your server is configured to serve it as text/gemini. I think the main
reason people didn't use .gem originally is because it's already used
for an image file format, and maybe also for Ruby gems.

My stargazer[1] has an option for this. If you run `stargazer -d` it'll 
server files out of the current directory and do file listing. It 
auto-generates certs and sticks them in `~/.local/share/stargazer`. Hope

Subject: Porting Gemini to EMACS GNUS
Message-ID: <87im7olca1.fsf@riseup.net>

Hello!

I hope you're all doing well.

I do a lot of my news and email reading in EMACS, using GNUS.

I did a little research, and I found out that GNUS supports subscribing
to RSS feeds natively. I also discovered that GNUS does not really
natively support atom feeds. In the EMACS Wiki, there are only
instructions to convert atom feeds into RSS with an external program.

I attempted to subscribe to a gemini atom feed inside GNUS, just to
attempt to push the envelope a little, and it was not possible.

I am curious: would anyone be able to give me a little guidance about
how I would go about modifying my GNUS so I could subscribe to gemini
atom feeds?

I have been doing quite a bit of study on EMACS LISP lately, so I think
I may be up to the task of doing this--I'm not asking for mentorship,
just perhaps some insights, suggestions, or warnings that anyone might
have.

--

I think the benefits of being able to access gemini space from inside
GNUS would add an extra layer of dynamism to using gemini inside EMACS,
and would help push forward my nefarious agenda to perfect a LISP
operating system (:

Thanks in advance,

vidak.

Does anyone have an thoughts or experience running hidden sites using Gemini? It seems like a great pairing.

The simplicity of the Gemini servers and (typical) use of static only content leave very little to attack or exploit on the end point. Handy for keeping those hidden services... hidden. 

The lack of privacy destroying features mean that, for the client side, the risk of client deanonymization should be much less. No cookies, WebRTC, JavaScript, etc.  

I did a little bit of experimentation and running a Gemini as a hidden service worked easily enough.  

Running Lagrange and a couple of other clients through Torify worked on the client side.  

I think I'm going to move forward and build up my Gemlog as a hidden site.  Is anyone else doing something like this, or have any interest in doing so? I'm also thinking it would be interesting to setup something like Capcom for hidden Gemlogs, if it doesn't already exist.

There are three I know of:

1. Gemini
2. Rocketeer
3. deedum

I believe they are all on the App Store now.

Hi,

I understand there were a lot of discussions surrounding how IDNs should
be implemented. I'm trying to implement IDNs right now, but I don't get
which approach I'm supposed to use.

According to gemini://gemini.bortzmeyer.org/gemini/iri.gmi ,
the primary two options seem like
1. only using punycode for DNS
2. using punycode for DNS and the Gemini server

It seems like the spec hasn't been updates on this, so which method
would be the best for compatibility with servers?

Sorry if I'm missing something, or if this has already been announced
previously.

I can confirm you can find The Gemini Browser (gemini) and deedum on App Store (tested on the French App Store).

gemini has one major advantage : it seems to use Firefox source code and it?s working pretty well. The only thing we could improve right now on it is the logo of the app, but it?s personal.

No decision has been taken yet, so there is not an "official" way of
doing IDN in Gemini. It's probably the biggest issue in the temporary
specification.

Today, it seems the majority of the servers expect an URI, not an
IRI. So you have to send ASCII-only requests (despite what the
temporary specification says).

Hello,

program: https://git.spwhitton.name/mailscripts/tree/gmi2email
manpage: https://git.spwhitton.name/mailscripts/tree/gmi2email.1.pod

I've written something like rss2email for gemlogs -- a way to have new
posts to gemlogs you are interested in arrive by e-mail, so those posts
come to you rather than you having to go to them.

Sharing here are others might want to make use of it.

Awesome.  Thanks so much!  A search for "Gemini" wasn't returning anything useful, but I did find those.

My guess is that you have two separate problems to solve: fetching feeds
from Gemini rather than HTTP, and handling Atom feeds rather than RSS.

My general recommendation is that you make a copy of nnrss.el as
nnatom.el and start hacking on it until it handles atom feeds. You'll
probably have to also look at mm-url.el, because it has all of the URL
handling code for Gnus, and you'll either have to teach it about Gemini,
or teach nnatom.el to use a separate code path for handling Gemini urls
vs HTTP ones. The rest is just xml wrangling, I guess, and you can get
what you need from the Atom specification.

Hello,

As Stephane says, there's no official decision yet. But option 2 is definitely 
the way to go. The Gemini spec requires the usage of URLs currently, and URLs
cannot have any Unicode in them.

Good luck with your implementation!

The Gemini specification precisely says the opposite when it mentions
"UTF-8 URLs". And, anyway, the specification is not final yet.

It depends on what you think that means; it's not a standard expression.  I
interpret it as meaning URLs in which sequences of escaped characters can
be interpreted as UTF-8: that is, "gemini://example.com/Julius/C%c3%a6sar"
is a UTF-8 URL, whereas "gemini://example.com/Julius/C%e6sar" is not.

Solderpunk has said before that this wording was a mistake, as URLs can only be 
ASCII as defined by RFC. Therefore they cannot contain IDNs.

Good to hear that it's acceptable. I hadn't thought of making it
configurable - I'll add that to the TODO list.

Image file format? Huh. Good to know.

I hadn't thought about *no* extension. I'm probably gonna skip that, but
make it configurable.

  Okay, I ran it through the Client Torture Test.  You had possible problems
with tests 34 through 38 where the first digit was defined, but not the
second digit (you treated them all as errors).  In my mind, to future proof
the client, just treat any unknown second digit as '0' (so 29 is 20, 39 is
30, etc).  But hey, another unpainted bikeshed here!

  Also, your client doesn't handle the following link properly:

	gemini://gemini.conman.org/test/UCSD-Pascal-source.zip/

It strips off the final '/', which does The Wrong Thing in this case (yes,
the final '/' is significant).  Speaking of which, you don't handle MIME
types properly---the page through your proxy tried printing the resulting
ZIP file as text.  I have a few other pages that return non "text/*" MIME
files.

  It also sends a client certificate.  Unexpected, but something I think
people should be aware of.

it's nice to see more http(s) proxies popping up, thank you for hosting
this!

something i would recommend on the frontend side of things would be to
put the css styling in a separate file so that browsers can cache it
instead of receiving an identical <style> tag for each page.

It looks nice and loads quickly as well. It would be better if it didn't

Hello everyone,

I discovered the Gemini project yesterday. The underlying philosophy of the protocol convinced me to at least run a server to add to the variety of content. I'm running a Gemserv on a self-hosted Raspi2. I plan to spend some time on implementing my own minimal server at some point. I'll make the best of our next lock-down.

gemini://gem.garichankar.com/

It was also the occasion for me to learn about tilde communities. Between those and Gemini, this Sunday the love I had for the network came back. I'm a 35+ IT worker, in France. How can I help ? How can I be relevant ? Opening folders through scp or even ssh to anyone asking, I can do, and it might help some to publish content. But maybe around here there are teams, groups, working on projects and needing help ?

Anyway, congratulations to everyone. I'm happy to be here !

Daniel

For content in french, there is a list of these at
<gemini://fran?ais.lanterne.chilliet.eu/>.

For programming projects, many programs in
<gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/software/> have a public repository
and some have a public issue tracking system. I would suggest to start
with these (they are probably the most open to outside help) and to
start sending patches.

At least until Microsoft implements a Gemini client, at which point MIME 
types will be ignored in favour of file extensions.

Poetry is dear to my soul. And in the Big Bloated Web is a pain to set it up properly. So, I resolved to explore it in Gemini. 

My first wee experiment is a pseudo-haiku Flor 4. This little poem or something has five spaces at the start of the first line. And it's displayed like that by amphora, However, the proxies I've tried collapse those spaces. I suppose due to the way HTML and CSS behave by default.

I've also had issues typesetting poetry in various markup languages; LaTeX has an alright mode but for HTML I use <pre style="font-family:serif;"> etc.  In fact, the only extension to the text/gemini format that I would imagine being behind would be a preformatted, but not monospaced font, block.  Not that that really makes any sense.

Anyway, when I've typeset poetry in Gemini I put the lines in between preformatting blocks -- at least that keeps the lines correctly spaced.

In HTML, out of desperation, I created my own tags <verso> and <estrofa> 
and some CSS for quite basic stuff. Not saying it's kosher, though.

But the thing is that amphora (haven't tested elsewhere) does respect the spacing
even when it's at the beginning of the line, even in regular gemini text (i.e not
preformated). However the proxis fail at this. 

I feel like the web forgot poetry, perhaps Gemini could do better. The
potential is there.

It works on amfora, but it does'nt on other clients (proxies, lagrange, 
etc.).
I guess the best way to do what you want is to use preformated text, 
it's the only way to really preserve the layout you choose.

Nice! Maybe I'm just being daft but I can't find Essex, is the list of locations
dynamic or only the forecast withing each location?

Good to know... I took a different approach with an unknown second digit as
you saw. I went back and re-read the spec... I couldn't find clear guidance
either way. In my mind it was better to be strict so that unknown status
codes wouldn't result in something unintended. To me a 29 isn't a 20... but
the spec does say that clients can exist without knowledge of the second
digit in a status code... I'll have to think about this some more.

Humm... the CLI version (that uses the same library) didn't fail on that
link. I think the intent is to get a directory listing of the content
inside the zip file, right? I'll have to walk through the code specifically
for that to see where it went wrong. Thanks for writing those tests.

Mime--types... yeah. I'll add that in.

  It also sends a client certificate.  Unexpected, but something I think

True. The client code underneath the HTTP handler always sends a
certificate when it makes the Gemini call. It's the same certificate for
every call, so there's nothing leaking from the users browser into the
certificate. Was that the concern?

Thanks for your feedback!

About loading stuff from Google... I understand there's some diverse
perspectives on that... and I'm probably going to stick with it as is for
now. I'm guessing your concern isn't about the load times - those should be
fast enough.

I can add a meta tag - thanks for the feedback!

  I wasn't actually expecting it to work!

  And personally, I find it hilarious (and wonderful) that it's the same
certificate for everybody.  Certainly makes it harder to track individuals,
but I can see it breaking some sites that may use certificates to present
different information.

Subject: Proposal: Simple structured form specification
Message-ID: <CAN4yCu_FGOybihNHQoss-n3rak3+Y8d5Yu5b3Pki+qUoc3c4bQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I have just started to get into Gemini, now running a simple server locally
with the Kristal client to test things out.

Reading the draft spec, I see there are only two ways to obtain input from
the
user -- via responses 10 and 11 (INPUT and SENSITIVE INPUT).

While this allows simple single-field entry of values to the server, there
appears to be no facility to allow users to enter multi-field, structured
data in a single operation -- that is, simple forms.

If it does not violate the fundamental tenets of the Gemini project, I
humbly
suggest an extension to the syntax of gemtext in the following manner to
enable structured multi-field forms. The logic and work here would be ~90%
on
the client side, as it is mostly a convention for encoding structured forms
within .gmi documents, parsed and acted on by the client. Form submission
would require no additional core server-side logic; interpretation of
submitted form values would follow the standard patterns of request handling
with URL query parameters.
No client or server state would be introduced.

I have used an encoding similar to what follows successfully in a past
'minimal HTML' project, to generate simple forms dynamically (but on the
server-side). I hope it might serve well to allow Gemini users a more
convenient way to interface with back-end programs, whilst preserving the
overall ethos of minimalism and privacy.

If the idea of adding a new link type to the gemtext specification is
anathema,
please consider the proposal as a purely client-side convention,
displayed but otherwise ignored by existing clients as part of the
<USER-FRIENDLY LINK NAME> portion of the existing '=>' syntax instead.

--

PROPOSAL
5.5.4 Link line form encoding

Lines beginning with the two characters "?>" are form-link lines, which
follow
the same rules as standard Link lines [5.4.2], plus a <FORM-SPEC> section
preceding the <USER-FRIENDLY LINK NAME>:

?>[<whitespace>]<URL>[<whitespace>]<FORM-SPECS><whitespace>[<USER-FRIENDLY
LINK NAME>]

where:

<whitespace> is any non-zero number of consecutive spaces or tabs
Square brackets indicate that the enclosed content is optional.
<URL> is a URL, which may be absolute or relative.
<FORM-SPEC> is a list of one or more <form-field-specifier> items, separated
 by the Unicode/ASCII forward-slash '/'. The client uses <FORM-SPEC> to
build
 a form entry popup, dialog, or series of input prompts to gather structured
 user input.

Each <form-field-specifier> follows the form

  T#VAR#DEFVALUE#LABEL

  where T ? [ s | c | b  ]

's' denotes a string (freeform data) field;
'x' denotes a string/number SENSITIVE field, which the client MUST shroud as
  password-type data;
'c' denotes a choice (dropdown/one-of) field;
'b' denotes a boolean ( checkbox, yes/no ) field

's' fields are freeform text, and may be used for numbers, text, or freeform
  data. It is the server's responsibility to validate submitted data.
For 'c' fields, the first choice is the default, all following choices being
  delimited from it and each other by the pipe '|' character.
For 'b' fields, allowable DEFVALUEs are [0 | 1], [yes | no], or [on | off].
The
  client is responsible for detecting these and returning sensible
  counterparts to the DEFVALUE if the user chooses their opposites.

VAR denotes the name of the form variable when submitting back to the server
  upon submission.
DEFVALUE denotes the default value to be displayed in the form. For choice
  type fields, the first item in the choice list is the default.
LABEL is text to be displayed by the client explaining the form field.
Clients
 MUST use the VAR field as a default LABEL if the .gmi link omits one.

A valid <FORM-SPEC> field is of the form

  <form-field-specifier>{/<form-field-specifier>/...}

Example - three field form requesting a string, a choice, and a boolean

  s#DELAY#5#Delay in seconds/c#SIZE#small|big|huge#Size of
something:b#DEBUG#1#

Note the above example has no LABEL for the final form field, so the client
  should render a default label using the form variable's name, 'DEBUG'.
This would instruct the client to display a form, popup or series of prompts
  (in the case of a text-based client) to enter three items.
The choice field would default to 'small', the first item in its set.
The client would return a URI upon submission with the query parameters

  ?DELAY=5&SIZE=small&DEBUG=1

if the user submitted with default values.


A fully-realized example of this proposed syntax would thus be

?> gemini://example.org/formSubmit s#DELAY#5#Delay in
seconds:c#SIZE#small|big|huge#Size of something:b#DEBUG#1# Please fill out
this handy form

Suggested limits on form structure and data

Max <form-field-specifiers>: 8
Max <form-field-specifier> sub-field lengths
  (VAR, DEFVALUE, LABEL): 255 Unicode characters
Max 'c' type choice length per item: 64 Unicode characters
Max 'c' type choices: 64
Max 's' value: enforced by server-side endpoint handler

Hi there, fellow Gemini-Essexonian!

Just browse into "East of England", then Essex is in there:

 ? gemini://caolan.uk/weather/ee/essex.gmi

Over here in my part of Essex, the weather is

 ? gemini://caolan.uk/cgi-bin/weather.py/wxfcs/310053

Also many thanks to Caolan for this new service - you may wish to submit

Thanks! Somehow I missed that and was only looking in South East.

Glad you like it :)

I'm sure the layout could be improved. If anyone has suggestions or wants to email me a gemtext example of what you'd like I'll definitely consider it.

I was about to write that the specification requires spaces to be kept,
but it doesn't: it only requires the preservation of empty lines, not
spaces.  However, the portal at portal.mozz.us and elpher (an emacs
client) preserve the whitespaces.

Speaking of CSS, one way to keep the whitespace is to use "white-space:
pre-wrap": it's what I'm using on my blog (to keep the double space at
the end of the sentences) and also what portal.mozz.us does IIRC.

The issue is that Gemini (and gemtext) is too close to being frozen
forever.  And most Gemini content out there doesn't need to use forms.

I have an alternative proposal: make the form on a new page, and use
something other than gemtext for it (and possibly something other than
Gemini the protocol).  I suggest instead making a gemtext-derived format
that is specially suited to forms, which has special line types and
stuff as necessary (in fact, I suggest adding a similar line type to the
one you gave in your proposal).  You could probably borrow from a lot of
the gemtext spec directly.  It would be best to use one of the
Gemini-analogue protocols which allow uploading (I know of Dioscuri,
Titan, and Inimeg) so that users could submit the form by performing an
upload process to the same URL.  Using a different protocol would be
best as then there are no upload limitations; with Gemini, the URL given
by the client has to be less than ~1024 bytes, which is not suited to
all forms.

This is my personal opinion, but I would go further and say that Gemini
doesn't need forms. If you have fully featured forms, you can implement
largely any kind of application (excluding very interactive ones), and
in the history of the web, this lead to re-implementing the whole
internet over port 80. I don't think Gemini needs to do that. The one
input lets you select different dynamic versions of a page, like for
different locales, or search results, or similar.

Having more complex forms is a temptation to implement applications on
Gemini, rather than using pairings of protocol+client that are more
appropriate (e.g. using NNTP for a message board).

Despite the danger of throwing this off-topic, here's how I mark-up poetry on my website (mostly; I'm correcting some things here):

```html
<p class="verse">
<span class="line">Twinkle, twinkle little star</span>
<span class="line">how I wonder what you are</span>
...
</p>
```

```css
.verse .line {
    text-indent: 1ch;
    margin-left: -1ch;
    position: relative;
    left: 1ch;
    display: block;
    white-space: pre-wrap;
}
```

I like having each line in a <span> because it feels more ... semantic, that way.

That's one way of doing it. You are addressing the issue that lines, not paragraphs are the units of a poem. 

However the sad thing is that you need to be sort of a "computer person" to dare to try this stuff. Many people who do poetry will not touch code with a 6 meters pole. But then again these are not the kind of people who would easily experiment in Gemini or Gopher.

I'm considering suggesting using pdf, just do what you have to do in your word processor of choice and print as pdf and it's all nice for all of us.

What about:

```html
<pre class="poetry">
Twinkle, twinkle little star
how I wonder what you are
</pre>

Would that work?

if the client can parse html and css, but if it can do that wouldn't you be recreating most of the web?

Point well taken -- I know it is a slippery slope, but I still think forms
could be
supported in a manner which keeps complexity down.

This form-builder idea could be implemented with no protocol changes,
100% client-side, within the existing => link syntax. To be user-friendly,
it would
require some sort of agreement by clients on the FORM-SPEC syntax.
Consider if clients agreed to act on documents ending in .gmif
('gemini-form'):

=> gemini://example.site/form.gmif This is a form link, click to fill out

.. clients could, by convention, parse such .gmiform files containing the
FORM-SPEC
using it to build a dynamic entry form. After form entry, the client would
encode it and send back
to the same endpoint (here, form.gmif) so the server could act on the
values.

For clients that did not choose to implement forms, they would by default
simply display .gmif
documents as any other plaintext resource.

The .gmif document holding the <FORM-SPEC> could even have comments with
instructions
on how to manually create a query to the endpoint, for users of older
clients eg:

[form.gmif]

s#DELAY#5#Delay in seconds
> c#SIZE#small|big|huge#Size of something
> b#DEBUG#1#

> //    gemini://example.site/form.gmif?DELAY=5&SIZE=small&DEBUG=1



As ~nothien points out, there's a limit of ~1024 bytes on URLs which I
think is a good thing;
working within the protocol as-is will naturally force relatively small,
simple forms.

So I guess I'm now proposing an optional client-side '.gmif' form standard
:)

IMO, yes.  Which is why, with Gemini, I stick to

```verse
Twinkle, twinkle...
```

It's "close enough".

I agree that Gemini should have forms, but that format doesn't look
great to me. What if forms were implemented as their own pages, not a
new link line type? I'm thinking something like this:

# Gemini Form Proposal
## Basic Format
Form fields are on their own line. Any line starting with `[in` is
considered a form element. This allows clients to continue to
determine line types by the first 3 characters. After the `[in`, a
dash is required.
After the dash, the input type is listed. If a client cannot handle an
input type, it SHOULD fall back to text. The rest of the line, up to
the first ] is used as options for the input. Next, there is a ]
character, then an optional text label.
## Escape sequences
In order to allow for ] characters, newlines, and literal backslashes
in input options, preface them with a backslash.
## Input types
Other types could be added, like number, email, phone, color, or even
file, but I feel this is an acceptable minimum set of types.
### text
A text input is a single line text input. Its format is as follows.
(Things in parentheses are optional)
```
[in-text <name>( <initial value>)]
```
For example,
```
[in-text userFullName Alex Fierro] What is your name?
```
### password
A password input is a single line text input that MUST hide the value
typed into it. For security reasons, there is now way to prefill a
password input. Its format is as follows.
```
[in-password <name>]
```
For example,
```
[in-password newPassword] What is your name?
```
### multiline
A multiline input is a text input that accepts any number of lines.
Its format is as follows. (Things in parentheses are optional)
```
[in-multiline <name> ( <initial value>)]
```
For example,
```
[in-multiline bio I am a demigod who enjoys art and the colors pink
and green.\nI usually use she/her pronouns, but sometimes I use
he/him.] Tell me about yourself
```
### submit
A submit input is a button that submits a form to a URL. It's label
SHOULD be used as the text on the button. Its format is as follows.
```
[in-submit /url/to/submit/to]
```
For example,
```
[in-submit /cgi-bin/profile.py] Update Profile
```
## Submitting
When an `[in-submit]` is (clicked|tapped|activated with the
keyboard|etc) all named inputs on the page (submit buttons are not
named) will be added to the URL of the submit button as query
parameters, and the resulting URL will be loaded.

Sure, I'm not attached too much to my syntax, it was a hack-ish one I'd
come up with for another project of mine.

I do feel like there should be some explicit allowance for one-of
types and boolean types, to give a client app hints as to what 'widgets'
to best use to present the valid values to the user  (eg., drop-downs or
choose a-b-c-d for a text-based client, and checkboxes). IMHO.

1) There is no standard for robots.txt.

2) There is not yet an "official" adaptation to Gemini, just
proposals.

I agree with this completely. I think Gemini should be a protocol for viewing
content only. I missed all the discussion around inimeg, titan etc. at the time
but I feel similarly about those.

I think a different protocol for filling out forms makes a lot more sense, and
we can work on having gemini clients and form clients play nicely together so
the user experience doesn't suffer from using a different program to fill out a
form.

Adding forms would take us wayyyyy too close to the web in my opinion.

  That will work, but you need to add a leading '/' to the Disallow line:

Disallow: /about

That will match any request starting with '/about', like '/about',
'/aboutthis', '/about/that', etc.

  That will work too (same thing about the Disallow: line though).  You can

But do note that many Gemini capsules do not follow this specification
but one of the others (typically more complicated).

An IRI is an URL. But an URI is not an IRI.

Either way, how is the final version of the spec coming along?

I've been following this discussion and while I'm on the side of "gemini doesn't need forms", I thought it would be fun to see how far we could simplify the concept of a form :) I don't have any direct responses to anything said thus far, but my ideas below have been inspired by the back and forth.

Ultimately, there are only a few data types that are truly needed for any form: binaries, choices, and text. This helps limit the scope of what would need to be implemented and what people would need to learn to be able to use forms. Keep it simple, smarty!

With gemini's limitation on URLs, and the fact that data can only be passed via the URL, we have to keep in mind that we'd want to limit the amount of information needed to be passed. Thus, I'd say that, were forms to be implemented, they must pass arguments positionally instead of as named parameters.

# Syntax
To keep it simple (and have fun), I think an input's identifier can simply be the reverse of the link identifier: <=

Much like how => signifies "going somewhere else", <= signifies "sending information here". 

<= lines take two parameters: type and label. Again, very similar to links :)

<= type label

As mentioned, there are really only three types of data that are meaningful and distinct. The valid options for "type" would only be "binary" "text" and "choice". "submit" is also a type that is needed as it's an action.

# binary
Binary options are best known as checkboxes on the web. They're simple on/off toggles. How they are displayed is up to the client

<= binary I have read this email and understand the binary option type

When submitted, this would be a simple 0/1 value in the url.

# text
The bulk of data that we could ever ask for is just 'text'. Differentiating between "tel" "num" and "text" should be done server-side, as these are all still just text fields. "password" is deliberately not supported -- this is why gemini has client certs.

<= text What's your website?

If an input should be multi-line, then the following could be used:

<= text Tell me what you like about gemini in a paragraph.
<= text

A single `<= text label` input can be followed by exactly one more `<= text` line to signify that it should be multi-line input. It is up to the client to decide how many lines to display. If a third `<= text` line were added, it would be interpreted as a new text input.

# choice
Choice is ultimately optional, IMO. This provides closed-ended responses for a user. Again, the idea of "radio" vs. "dropdown" vs. anything else does not matter, as those are entirely client-side decisions. What's important is that the user is only able to select one response.

<= choice Which of these protocols are we using?
<= choice gemini
<= choice gopher
<= choice HTTP

After an initial `<= choice` toggle, immediately adjacent ones are interpreted as options for a single input. The above could be displayed as a dropdown, or radio boxes, or anything the client decides.

# submit
Finally, submit. This one's easy:

<= submit /path/to/interpreter

Note that there's no support for a custom label for the button -- again, by design :) We don't need them.

# Putting it all together

The last part is how it's passed. As mentioned at the beginning, I think (were gemini to support this, which I don't think it should) that form inputs are sent /positional/, not named. This is a requirement to reduce the chance of hitting the url limit.

Using the above inputs as an example, upon clicking the submit button, the url would look like this (for my own sanity I'm not doing proper url encoding -- i leave that as an exercise to the reader):

/path/to/interpreter?1&edaha.org&I like how simple and easy it is to use\nit's a lot of fun!&gemini

and that's it! I've got to get back to work now, but this was a fun thought experiment :)

I agree that there should me checkboxes, but I think radio buttons are more
in the spirit of Gemini than menus.


RE: Keeping Gemini simple, what if forms were a separate MIME type like
text/form+gemini? I think forms are important to have because unlike ex.
file uploads I don't know if there is another lightweight solution. The
only options I can think of for form filling and submission are PDF forms,
but those are only really usable in Acrobat and HTML forms, which I suppose
we could serve over Gemini but often require JavaScript to function.

I think this should have a [TECH] tag? [1]

I am quite firmly on the "Gemini does not need forms" side. At least as far as implementing additional syntax in clients. For some clients it might be a big leap to have to implement this, especially considering you can already build forms in Gemini, you just have to get a bit creative and it does not require any new syntax or behaviour on the client side. And thus no additional specification. But again: One should think twice if this really has to be implemented using Gemini and not another, more suited protocol.

The basic idea is the following: Each form field is presented on a separate "page" and the server keeps track of where the client is in the form. Ideally the URL (URI/IRI?) contains all the data necessary, thus "saving" the data on the client so it might be continued at a later date. If the amount of data expected is larger than would fit in the URL, server side state with client certificates would be an alternative.

Now to the different types of input fields. I assume the form's base is gemini://example.com/form/ which might display some information about the form and the first input field.

On 27.01.2021 18:37, me at edaha.org wrote among?other?things:

A check box can be simply implemented with two links for yes and no like this for example:
```
Does Gemini need forms?
=> 0/ No, it does not.
=> 1/ Yes, it does.
```

These two links would then direct the client to either <gemini://example.com/form/0/> or <gemini://example.com/form/1/> respectively. Now the server would have to understand that this still belongs to the form and it should serve the next input field page. In this example I just put each input in a path segment as that is the first thing I came up with. You could of course put this in the query, separate it with spaces, commas semicolons or something completely different.

A nice side effect of doing it this way is that you could in theory build this from a static site server by creating respectively named directories and index.gmi files (or whatever your server happens to use).

 > # text
 > The bulk of data that we could ever ask for is just 'text'.

We already have this (and passwords too!) with status codes 10 and 11. So when you go to either of the URLs in the example above, the server will have to respond with that status code. Upon receiving the data it might redirect the client so that the URL holds some representation of the data, say for example to <gemini://example.com/0/42/>.

 > Differentiating between "tel" "num" and "text" should be done server-side, as these are all still just text fields.

I completely agree.

 > "password" is deliberately not supported -- this is why gemini has client certs.

Odd choice considering Gemini already has support for this.

 > If an input should be multi-line, then the following could be used: [...]

That is not something that could be implemented by using Gemini this way [2], but if you want to write big amounts of text, you should really use something else, e.g. file upload (ftp) or maybe email, irc, xmpp, nntp, etc.

This could be implemented just like a checkbox, just with more options. Coincidentally the syntax is very similar to the one proposed.
```
Which of these protocols are we using?
=> gemini/ gemini
=> gopher/ gopher
=> http/ HTTP
```

 > # submit
 > Finally, submit. This one's easy:

... because it is not necessary. The server will just show you the result or take the respective action after the last form field is filled. Maybe a final checkbox of "Are you sure" would be nice to let the user know that this will result in some action.

And as I said above, you can pass these however you like, although I would guess using the path segment approach would be the easiest and best supported. If I recall correctly there were different opinions voiced about carrying on a query in a redirect. So who knows what some clients might do if the data is all stored in the query and a user decides to go to the next form field.

 > and that's it!

... we do not need an additional specification for this. If you insist on implementing forms in Gemini, you already can - it just requires you to think a bit, and the solution might addmittedly be a bit clunky. But that's because Gemini is not meant for doing forms!

I hope this was not too bad of a rant but actually helpful.

And now me...

tl;dr: Gemini can already emulate forms. We just need a spec language
       clarification in Section 3.2.1 1x (INPUT) from Solderpunk and for
       client authors to update their software accordingly. I illustrate
       both points (and provide code) below.


# Section 1: Motivation


I appreciate the generally conservative nature of the Gemini community
when it comes to extending the Gemini and Gemtext specifications. As a
server author, this certainly keeps my life easier.

However, I'd like to go on record here to say that interactive capsules
are not something that worries me. There are already quite a few of them
out there in Geminispace (hello Astrobotany!), and I'd like to continue
to see this medium grow and thrive in our little corner of the internet.

I don't think form-like data submission should be seen as an evil. It
allows us to implement a wide variety of CGI-style applications that do
all their computing on the server side (often through some script
extension mechanism). This keeps our servers and clients simple,
empowers content authors to build cool things, and still keeps us nicely
insulated from "The Javascript Trap" since our Gemini clients never
download and run any client-side code.

=> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html The Javascript Trap


# Section 2: The Problem


Over the months that I have followed this mailing list, I've seen
broadly two categories of proposals around extending Gemini's simple
input methods:

1. Ways to submit multiple pieces of information to a server at once.

2. Ways to upload files to a server.

Both proposals are pretty self-explanatory since they extend the
possible functionality of interactive Gemini capsules without breaking
any of our privacy or security guarantees. However, option 1 puts an
additional burden on client authors, and option 2 puts an additional
burden on both client and server authors.

Some members of our community have suggested that these features aren't
worth the extra effort. Others have argued in favor of one or both of
them, and a brave few have gone off and created their own sister
protocols to try and implement Gemini-like systems that also support
some variant of these two data upload options (e.g., Titan, Dioscuri,
Inimeg).

>From a personal standpoint (and I can only speak for myself here
obviously), I wouldn't mind one or more form types being added to
Gemtext (option 1 above) as it would reduce the total number of
round-trip network requests between client and server to submit multiple
pieces of information (and I have quite a slow satellite internet
connection, so this matters to me).


# Section 3: A Solution


However, even without (a very unlikely) form enhancement to Solderpunk's
Gemtext spec, I'd like to remind folks that we actually do (or at least
we should) already have the ability to emulate forms in our Gemini
capsules.


## Section 3.1: Form Templates


Assuming we are currently browsing a page at
gemini://awesome.capsule.net/form, this dynamic Gemtext page could
include forms as follows:

```Gemtext form template
# Welcome to my Gemini Form!

To fill in any field below, simply click it. Everything's a link in Gemini, so you can't really mess up!

=> form?$SESSION&name Name: $NAME

=> form?$SESSION&password Password: $PASSWORD

=> form?$SESSION&smog SMOG is great: $SMOG

=> form?$SESSION&plant Best Astrobotany Plant: $PLANT

=> form?$SESSION&submit Submit Answers
```

Here, my Gemtext is a template string, which I process in a context in
which $SESSION, $NAME, $PASSWORD, $SMOG, and $PLANT are defined (or
default to empty strings). When the page first loads, we create a new
$SESSION value in our CGI script and insert it into the links to
preserve state across requests until we restart the server or the user
refreshes the page.

(Obviously, a more robust state management mechanism could be achieved
with client certs and a DB, but I just mean to show a very simple
example here.)


## Section 3.2: Server-side Responses


Here would be the server-side responses for each of those links:

* NAME: 10 Enter your name\r\n
* PASSWORD: 11 Enter password\r\n
* SMOG: 10 Choose one of [Yes|No]\r\n
* PLANT: 10 Choose one of [Ficus|Baobob|Pachypodium|Moss]\r\n

For the boolean choice (SMOG) and the multiple choice (PLANT) inputs,
you could, of course, perform input validation and re-prompt if
necessary. You could also simply include one link per choice in your
form template instead of using a 10 INPUT response.


## Section 3.3: (DESIRED) Client-side Requests


The intention of this example is that the clients would produce requests
of this form after each input prompt:

=> gemini://awesome.capsule.net/form?$SESSION&name&Gary%20Johnson
=> gemini://awesome.capsule.net/form?$SESSION&password&secret
=> gemini://awesome.capsule.net/form?$SESSION&smog&yes
=> gemini://awesome.capsule.net/form?$SESSION&plant&Ficus

where $SESSION is whatever value was generated by the CGI script on the
first page load.


## Section 3.4: Server-side State Management and Form Submission


With this information in the query params, it would be easy to store a
lookup table in the CGI script that mapped session -> field -> value,
and these values can then be easily inserted into the original Gemtext
template form above (see Section 3.1) in response to these requests.

The form?$SESSION&submit link can then trigger the server to validate
that all of the required form fields have been filled in correctly and
perform whatever next step operation you want.


## Section 3.5: File "Uploads"


In addition, as I mentioned several months ago on this list, you could
perform file "uploads" by having one of the input links prompt for a URL
to a file. Then the server could download that file and store it in your
session (or account if you're using client certs and a DB).


# Section 4: What's Stopping This from Working?


While this example creates more back-and-forth requests than a proper
client-side form would generate, I hope it demonstrates that Gemini and
Gemtext in their current incarnations are already sufficiently complete
to build interactive CGI applications with them today.

The only problem I'm running into here is that the various Gemini
clients I've tested (elpher, bombadillo, kristall) don't actually append
a user's input as an additional parameter to an existing query string if
one is present. Instead, bombadillo and kristall just overwrite the
existing query string and only return ?$NEW_INPUT. Elpher, on the other
hand, just creates invalid URLs by simply appending ?$NEW_INPUT to
whatever is already in the URL (e.g.,
gemini://awesome.capsule.net/form?$SESSION&smog?yes. Neither of these
behaviors do what I'd want or expect here.


## Section 4.1: Check the Spec!


I think the culprit then is probably Gemini Protocol Specification
section 3.2.1 1x (INPUT):

```Gemini specification section 3.2.1 1x (INPUT)
Status codes beginning with 1 are INPUT status codes, meaning:

The requested resource accepts a line of textual user input. The <META>
line is a prompt which should be displayed to the user. The same
resource should then be requested again with the user's input included
as a query component. Queries are included in requests as per the usual
generic URL definition in RFC3986, i.e. separated from the path by a ?.
Reserved characters used in the user's input must be "percent-encoded"
as per RFC3986, and space characters should also be percent-encoded.
```


## Section 4.2: Append Don't Replace!


As far as I can tell, the fix here is for Solderpunk to update the text
in section 3.2.1 to indicate that if a query string is already part of
the request leading to an INPUT response, then the user's input should
be appended (using &) to the existing query string rather than replacing
it wholesale (using ?).

Otherwise, we really have no way to input more than one query param
(with &) other than asking the user to type it directly into the INPUT
prompt (e.g., cat&dog&pig). I'm hoping this isn't the spec's intention
here and that we just have a case of ambiguous wording that has led some
client authors to create divergent (or broken) implementations.


# Section 5: Conclusion and a Call to Action


Okay, that was a LONG message, but I hope I've communicated my points
clearly. Thanks to all who read this far, and thanks to everyone for
making Gemini such an active and engaging community!

I've attached a short (47 line) CGI script (for Space Age) that
implements the dynamic form example described in this email. If clients
would append user input params (with &) to existing query strings rather
than replace them, it should work perfectly. Until then, it will just
have to feel a bit sad and dejected.

Whose client is going to make it work first! I wait eagerly with bated
breath to find out.

Happy hacking!

Hello,

Please help me understand viability of creating simple form-based apps
like message boards, job offer boards, etc on Gemini.

I am aware there are no multi-input forms but there seem to be an
"input" feature.

Does Gemini support or intends to support meaningful user input and
interactivity?

Is it realistic to build real world "text applications"?

How about multi-line user input, file upload etc?

Any example apps?

TIA!

In theory you could do it, have a look at a recent thread on forms in the
mailing list archives:
<https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2021/004921.html>

 > Does Gemini support or intends to support meaningful user input and

I don't think so, beyond what is already present with the input and secret input
status codes, as well as just "being on a page".

 > Is it realistic to build real world "text applications"?

Probably not, why not use another protocol? (again, see the linked thread)

 > How about multi-line user input, file upload etc?

Multiline input is theoretically possible by percent encoding a linefeed.

For file upload, maybe have a look at one of the adaptations mentioned in the
linked thread (Dioscuri, Titan, and Inimeg)?

 > Any example apps?

Depends on what you would call an app. You can have a look at some pieces
published on the mailing list:

I'm going to quickly cover what I think are the best solutions to these
two applications.

Message boards *can* be done on Gemini.  Short-form message boards,
somewhat like Twitter, with short message sizes, can definitely be done.
For example, you may have a 'post' page where the user provides
plain-text input as the post to be made, and the server redirects them
to the newly created post.  Gemini provides and strongly recommends TLS
client certificates for authentication, so I suggest that the server
distributes a cert to the user when they sign up.  But you can't do
things like notifications.

Long-form message boards which require different input formats, file and
image uploads, notifications, etc. are much, much better to implement as
mailing lists.  All you need on top of a standard mailing list server is
a way to neatly present that information (i.e. to view topics/mails),
and that can be on Gemini easily.

A job offer board could be implemented as a Gemini server which lists
jobs and an e-mail address to receive e-mails from potential employees.
I don't think that giving users actual accounts and verifying that
they're human and stuff is a good idea - leave that up to the hiring
companies.  It would be pretty neat to have a free gemsite (?) listing
job offers from FOSS companies.

When this topic have come up in the past, we have concluded that Gemini can
support forms with serial input fields, as opposed to the parallel input
fields people are used to from web forms.

One way to do this is to send status 10 until all the fields are satisfied,
like a CLI. Another way is to have a page with links pointing to one field
at a time.

I haven't seen this approach yet, seems just as valid as the other ones.

Now to the different types of input fields. I assume the form's base is

Asking a question like this is not a good example for showing off
checkboxes but another way is to send this:
```
10 Does Gemini need forms? [yes/no]
```
...and repeat until the user supply a valid answer.

Multiple choice checkboxes can be combined into one input:
```
10 My server supports: [c: CGI, v: virtual host, s: sessions]
```
...and the user can answer "sv" or "cs" or "v" or whatever other valid
combination.

This refers to a single choice among a list of things.

This would be:
```
10 Which of these protocols are we using? [gemini/gopher/http]
```
...in that same example. Though, I do like the links better.

Or just "Confirm sending this information"

I described the current state of affairs around building dynamic
applications with Gemini and Gemtext in a recent message thread called
"The Tragedy of &". You can see it in the mailing list archives here:

  https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2021/004947.html

A great (and quite popular) Gemini app is Astrobotany, which you can
find here:

  gemini://astrobotany.mozz.us/

Have fun exploring Geminispace. The culture here celebrates doing more
with less. It's pretty uncommon to get new features added to the
protocol or markup language, so this drives people to get creative in
their thinking about how to mix-and-match protocols to build the things
they want or to find new solutions to old problems using Gemini's modest
toolkit.

Happy hacking!
  Gary

Actually that's a good idea. PDF is a great format for preserving
everything you want and be sure that's it's displayed nicely on
other's computers.

And gemini can serve PDFs without any kind of issues.

Thank you all for the patient and informative discussions regarding the
'can of worms' I may have opened re: forms...

I think the responses below do address many, if not all, of the concerns
I initially had when proposing a form facility. I think it's great that
Gemini
strives to 'do more with less' and I can see some of these suggestions
are very clever. I'm going to try them out in an app of my own now :)
It just takes a bit of a different approach from HTML.

Subject: Gemini input validation errors
Message-ID: <CAFTy05aesPd9Ya=_jymYP6uh3UpYd5WAsfiN68MXOY2wnP5qbA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Piggybacking on the recent threads about forms in gemini, how should
we be handling errors with input validation? I've run into this
problem a few times already with astrobotany and I haven't found a
great solution for it yet.

REQUEST  : gemini://example.com/page/input
RESPONSE : 10 Enter a choice [yes/no]
REQUEST  : gemini://example.com/page/input?potato
RESPONSE : ???

---

Option 1.

Return a proper error response code.

REQUEST  : gemini://example.com/page/input?potato
RESPONSE : 59 Invalid choice (potato)

Pros
- Feels like the semantically correct thing to do.

Cons
- Many gemini clients don't display the human readable meta along
  the error codes (For consistency, I guess?). This results in a
  terribly confusing user experience.

---

Option 2.

Return a new input prompt with the error message included.

REQUEST  : gemini://example.com/page/input?potato
RESPONSE : 10 Invalid choice (potato). Enter a choice [yes/no]

Pros
- Convenient for the user.
- The UI is reasonably clean.

Cons
- It can get ugly really quickly with longer error messages being
  concatenated on the same line as the original prompt.

---

Option 3.

Return a successful response with the error as plain text.

REQUEST  : gemini://example.com/page/input?potato
RESPONSE : 20 text/gemini
           Invalid option (potato).

Pros
- Will always display the error message to the user.

Cons
- No semantic indication that there was an error.
- Can screw up browser history.

---

I know it's blasphemy but a new error code could be really nice here.
Something like

54 INVALID INPUT
Indicates that the query string contained a value that was not
accepted by the server. The <meta> should be a human-readable
error message that will be shown to the user. Sophisticated clients
can display the error message along with re-prompting the user with
the same input from the previous request.

Any thoughts or other ideas?

Hi,

after a few days of public testing i'm happy to announce the launch of 
geminispace.info, a new search provider for the Gemini protocol:
gemini://geminispace.info

This is not about reinventing the wheel, geminispace.info is a 
independent instance of the great GUS by Natalie Pendragon 
and contributors: https://natpen.net/code/gus

This is NOT a fork of GUS, i intend to send patches to upstream
if appropiate. First patches has already been submitted for discussion.

Updates of the search index are currently scheduled to happen twice a week.
We'll see how this goes when geminispace keeps growing. 

Feedback welcome.

regards
Ren?

Yes, if the client supports client certificates, we can skip sending
$SESSION and use the regular inputs:

```text/gemini list of links
=> gemini://awesome.capsule.net/form/name Name
=> gemini://awesome.capsule.net/form/password Password

I do not understand this example.

When using regular inputs, the client will send these requests:

gemini://awesome.capsule.net/form/name?Gary%Johnson
gemini://awesome.capsule.net/form/password?secret
gemini://awesome.capsule.net/form/smog?yes
gemini://awesome.capsule.net/form/plant?Ficus
gemini://awesome.capsule.net/form/submit

(No "?" on "submit" since it's just telling the server that we're done.)

What is the benefit of doing it your way?

If you format the URLs like this:

gemini://$HOST/path/to/script/$FIELD?$VALUE

...then $FIELD should show up as PATH_INFO (probably with a leading "/")
and $VALUE as QUERY_STRING.

Elpher is doing something weird here but the others are handling inputs as

This is not a necessary spec change.

The responsibility for collecting parameters fall on the server, not on the
client. The only thing the client needs to do is sending one query for each
field.

Sorry to disappoint you. I suggest leaving the ampersands to the web
queries.

I don't know if relative redirects are still in the spec, but they were

All,

We are proud to announce the Mansfield client and server.

Please find the client at https://ondollo.com/mansfield

We are running an instance of the Mansfield server at ondollo.com. We've
worked hard to make the Client and Server fit our perspective on the need
to support creation of content as much as consumption. There are a few
features we want to highlight here:

 * Pressing "Ctrl-n" in the Mansfield Client starts the cycle of creating a
new page on the Mansfield server - the content of the new page (as well as
any other page on that server owned by the currently active client
certificate) is edited directly in the Mansfield client. No other tools,
processes, or accounts are required to create text/gemini pages in Gemini
Space. Of course the automated process that "Ctrl-n" guides the user
through can be navigated manually as well.
 * If working through a list of links (from say, a Gemini feed), and you've
navigated from the list to one of the links, you can press "n" to have the
client automatically go back to the list, move down to the next link, and
access that link's referenced content... so... keep pressing "n" and you
just step through all of the listed content. Pressing "p" works similarly,
but goes to the previous link instead of the next link.
 * There are many other shortcuts, listed by pressing "Ctrl-s"

We know there are probably bugs we've missed or haven't found yet, and
we're still working on additional features - but we wanted to release
before everything was perfect to allow feedback to start showing up.

We're excited to learn what others think of our approach to supporting
creation of content as much as consumption.

Thanks!

Subject: [ANN] [users] Two new capsules and a server
Message-ID: <87k0rubiuq.fsf@omarpolo.com>

Hello,

I've started using gemini around last October, but I never announced my
capsule.  In these last weeks I started another one, and I've also just
released a new version of my Gemini server, so I thought it was a good
time to make an announcement :)


=> gemini://gemini.omarpolo.com

It's my primary capsule/blog.  I write about things that I find
interesting, usually programming-related stuff but not only, in (an
hopefully correct) English.  This capsule is managed using the same
static site generator written in clojure I use for the WWW version of
the site.


=> gemini://it.omarpolo.com

This one is new, entirely written in Italian, and it's not a mirror of
the English one.  With this capsule I'm trying to do a little experiment
and see how it goes without using a generator: every page is written by
hand and rsync'ed on the server.  It's also gemini-only, or
gemini-exclusive if you prefer ;).  I'm still writing about things that
I find interesting of course, but it's a bit more "casual".


=> gemini://gemini.omarpolo.com/pages/gmid.gmi
=> https://github.com/omar-polo/gmid

gmid was my introduction to Gemini.  After discovering the protocol and
reading the specification, I though it was easy enough and I tried to
write a server for it (first commit is dated 2020-10-02).  The first
time I used a gemini client was to see if the server was working
correctly IIRC.

Over the time I slowly improved it to match my needs.  In these last
two/three weeks in particular I ended up adding a bunch of features,
from virtual host support to a configuration file and various security
features.  It's also now usable both as a proper daemon and from the
command line to quickly serve any directory (with automatic certificate
generation).

To the best of my knowledge (although I'll be happy to be proved wrong),
it's the only Gemini server that is sandboxed by default on OpenBSD
(with pledge and unveil), FreeBSD (capsicum) and linux (seccomp), other
than being able to chroot(2) itself.

Other than that, the other features are pretty much what you'd expect:
virtual hosts, configuration file with per-location rules, CGI scripts,
punycode, IRIs, directory listings ecc.

I tagged the v1.5 today, dubbed "Interstellar Overdrive" because why
not.

Thanks,

Omar Polo

Hi Katarina,

  Thanks for taking the time to reply to my message. I'll try to clarify
my point here.

The issue I'm raising is that there appears to be no way to pass more
than one piece of information at a time in our query strings. This has a
very significant impact on any writers of CGI scripts, which is how many
Gemini servers allow users to add dynamic pages to their capsules.

But why, you ask?

Because each CGI script is available at a particular file path and
therefore additional path segments can't be used to pass information to
them. They have to get their inputs from the query string.

This is a script. It probably returns a 20 response:

=> gemini://awesome.capsule.net/form.clj

If I want to fill in a name field on that page, I might provide a link
like this:

=> gemini://awesome.capsule.net/form.clj?name

This calls the CGI script with a query parameter. Great! The script can
use "name" to look up the appropriate response. Here it is:

10 Please enter your name\r\n

However, when the user fills in their name, the browser will now send
this request to the server:

=> gemini://awesome.capsule.net/form.clj?Gary%20Johnson

There is no way for the CGI script to know that this is a name value and
not the value for any other form field on the page.

And therein lies the rub. If the only way to associate input values with
the variables they represent is with path segments, then CGI scripts
simply can't ever use more than one input field per page. Even then, if
the query string used to trigger a 10 INPUT response is typed by the
user (into the totally free form text field they are presented), then
the server will continue to respond with yet another 10 INPUT response.

This would make a form with N fields require N+1 separate CGI scripts,
all chained together via links that represent the directory structure
into which they are installed.

This is an absolute nightmare scenario for programming anything that
wants to accept user inputs.

So what does this mean for Geminispace?

It means essentially that CGI scripts are currently second-class
citizens, and the only people who can write dynamic capsules are server
authors (or people willing to hack on server code). This is because
encoding information using path segments requires injecting custom
routing table code into the server's request handler.

As a server author, I am capable of creating a custom fork of my server
with a new routing table for each dynamic capsule I want to build.
However, I suspect the majority of Gemini users are not going to have
both the skill and willingness to engage in this level of coding on
their pages.

That is why I and many other authors have added support for CGI scripts
to our servers. But under the "only one piece of information in the
query string" paradigm, these scripts are currently rather handicapped
when it comes to accepting user input.

Hopefully, I've made the technical merits of my case clear here.

Yes, it really is if anyone other than server authors is ever going to
be able to write their own dynamic pages.

Again, see above. A single query value cannot be associated with its
variable without adding a custom routing table to the server to enable
the parsing of path segment data as additional inputs.

I'm afraid we disagree here.

If you can write a CGI script that can correctly associate INPUT
responses with their intended variables, please share it. I suspect it
would be quite educational.

Happy hacking,

This is going to be weird, because I disagree with almost everything you've said except that appending the query string should be guaranteed. I hope this is helpful

Well, you *could* pass extra path info to the script... So, the script at cgi-bin/index.cgi handles all cgi-bin/* and treats the path after cgi-bin as positional arguments

CGI scripts *are* second class citizens in Gemini, but it's because the UX and dev-op experience of line based input is terrible. The fact that a static routing table is more performant and has a better security profile than parsing the path info dynamically is less relevant than the fact that this is a line based protocol

Now, "Append, don't replace," is a reasonable expectation to make of clients and it's still useful for the devops situation, even if it's not *strictly* necessary

The two alternatives to requiring clients to preserve collected state in the query parameter are to save state in the CGI script or to pass positional arguments via the path. I think append is reasonable. It also preserves principle of least surprise and other desirable qualities

CGI *is* going to be second class in Gemini as long as forms aren't an option, but that's a consequence of the decision to support line-based clients. Appending the query doesn't do violence to that design

  Not if the CGI interface is properly written.  All I had to do was write
this CGI script and drop it into my tests directory [1]:

	gemini://gemini.conman.org/test/pathseg.cgi

It uses only three of the RFC-3875 defined variables, QUERY_STRING,
SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO to do all the work.  The script will ask for three
fields and then present a final page with all three fields.  But the script
will only work if all three variables are defined per RFC-3975 (PATH_INFO is
the tricky one).

  Yes, it's a bit ugly and yes, it's a second class citizen and yes, it
requires a proper CGI module to work, but it can be done without the
configuration you think it does.  The script just simply appends each input
field as the path, so if you enter

	and a one
	and a two
	skidoosh

as the values, the final URL will be:

	gemini://gemini.conman.org/test/pathseg.cgi/and%20a%20one/and%20a%20two/skidoosh

  Yes, I could have done a bit more processing, naming each segment:

	/test/pathseg.cgi/name=and%20a%20one/age=and%20a%20two/action=skidoosh

but I was lazy and wanted to just do a proof-of-concept here.

  The CGI support seems ... not quite the CGI that I know.  It's closer to
SCGI, but even then, it's not SCGI.  Looking at the code, any currently
written CGI script for Gemini won't work out of the box.  You might want to
think about calling it something else, or work to getting actual CGI or SCGI
support going (SCGI is closer to what you are doing).

When I asked about CGI compatibility, the answer was that different servers
did it differently anyway.  That's probably something we should fix in the
best-practices document.

A TLS session is not the same as an application session.  I may, for
example, have two tabs (or whatever) open in my Gemini browser that refer
to the same access-controlled capsule, and which therefore must be accessed
with the same cert.  Nevertheless, the two pages should operate as distinct
sessions: I should be able to fill out a form in one page while searching
help documents in the other.  So I think a session ID is the Right Thing.
However, this is a matter of server/capsule/CGI design, not of the Gemini
protocol.

The biggest problem is most likely the cost of setting up and tearing down
all the TLS connections, but there is no help for that.

"Included" is a vague word, and should be fixed whether we do appending or
not.

I suggest that if there is no query part, we append ? followed by the
user's input, whereas if there is, we just append the user's input.  That
lets a simple form work like this:

1) Suppose Fluffy (a server) wants me to send my name and email address.
Fluffy sends this bare-bones text/gemini document, which we will say comes
from gemini://fluffy.example/form1, to my client Aarfy.

=> Name: ?name=
=> Email: ?email=

2) Let's say I choose the first link.  Fluffy sends Arfy 10 Enter your name.
I type John Cowan into Aarfy, which sends the URL
gemini://fluffy.example/form1?session=ABC&name=John%20Cowan.  Fluffy sends
this new document to Aarfy:

=> Name [John Cowan]: ?session=ABC&name=
=> Email: ?session=ABC&name=John%20Cowan&email=

3) If I choose the first link, I can change my name.  If I choose the
second link, Fluffy will send Arfy 10 Enter your email.  I type
cowan at ccil.org into Aarfy, which sends the URL
gemini://fluffy.example/form1?session=ABC&name=John%20Cowan&email=
cowan at ccil.org.  Fluffy sends this third document to Aarfy:

=> Name [John Cowan]: ?session=ABC&email=cowan at ccil.org&name=
=> Email: [cowan at ccil.org] ?session=ABC&name=John%20Cowan&email=
=> Submit: [cowan at ccil.org] ?session=ABC&name=John%20Cowan&email=
cowan at ccil.org&submit

4) If I choose the first or second link again, I can change my name or
email address.  But if I choose the third link, which Fluffy does *not*
interpret as a search link, Fluffy will write my name and email into a
database, or send me an email saying "HA HA HA!", or whatever it does.

Because all that happens is following links and reading input lines, it
does not matter if Aarfy is a CLI, TUI, or GUI client: the protocol
exchanges work in any case.  Furthermore, Fluffy does not have to retain
partial state, because it is passed back and forth between Aarfy and Fluffy
with no real interpretation at either end until Aarfy receives a submission
URL.

For that matter there is no real need to have a submission link: an URL
that specifies both name and email could be interpreted as a submission.
As before, this is a matter of design, not protocol.

Thanks for taking the time and read the code.  I admit I've not followed
RFC3875 closely.  By skimming it I thought "oh, this is simple" and
implemented it straight away.

What I'm currently doing is executing the script with the virtual host
directory as $PWD and setting a bunch of environmental variables.  All
the output of the script is then forwarded to the client.

By re-reading RFC3875 I assume that, except for the environment
variables that I'll double check later, I only need to execute the
script in the script directory instead of the vhost one.  The RFC
mention passing data in stdin, but it seems only for POST requests and
I'm assuming Gemini ones are ``GET''.  It also mention parsing the query
and passing it as argument to the script: this is something interesting,
but I'm not sure how to spilt it?  The & doesn't seem widespread here,
so I have to pass the whole query as first argument?

Of course I'd like to have a complete CGI support, and not something
merely closer, so I'll take some time to read how other servers are
handling them, starting from your GLV-1.12556.

I'd like too, as pointed by John Cowan, to have a best-practices or a
companion specification for CGI on Gemini, as RFC3875 seems quite
HTTP-specific, but I don't think I'm the most qualified to write one :D

Well, there is "0-RTT" TLS session resumption with early data. That 
reduces the overheads substantially (though it still requires a fresh 
TCP connection for each request). As far as I know no server supports 
0-RTT currently, and I think only a few clients do. But it would fit 
well with heavy CGI use.

Message-ID: <9ef71288-3786-45d4-ba66-a2907f2a0e3d@www.fastmail.com>

Dear all,

I've been giving some thought to how to share poetry and other, let's say, more typographically rich content in Gemini. One solution that was given to me works in some way. That is to attach a pdf. I'm already using that approach, generating my pdfs on Groff. (It was a excuse as good as any other, plus I can generate the stuff directly on the server, without the overhead of LaTeX.

Anyway, I think there could be a Groff inspired alterntaive that would not be too difficult to implement, except it deviates from the "markdown-inspired" formatting. 

Enviroments. We already have one: plain text. We could have something like

```
.PO
roses are red
this     preserved space is not blue
so poetry you can do
.PO
```

.PO would tell the client to "please switch poetry mode on/off if you know how to"

The client would only need to examine the first three characters as usual, so it would even possible to mark it in a human readable way, for those cross-posting on gopher or for those clients that would not implement the environment or simply treat it as plain text.

```
.POem begins
roses are red ...
whatever is blue
...
.POem ends
``` 

The client will only "see" the first 3 characters of the code .PO switching the mode on and off. Of course other such environments could be possible.

Just some food for thought.

Thanks for sharing some code, Sean. I, of course, realize that one could
write a CGI script to pick apart the PATH_INFO for user inputs. This
issue I raised in my message was that this doesn't make any sense in the
context of a CGI script which is looked up using the path on the remote
filesystem.

In your example, your script is located at /test/pathseg.cgi. However,
lacking side information, I see no indicator (outside of the --
admittedly optional -- cgi extension on your file name) of which path
segments should be considered part of the CGI filename lookup and which
parts are meant to be user input data in your example link:

/test/pathseg.cgi/name=and%20a%20one/age=and%20a%20two/action=skidoosh

This feels like a massive hack to me and an abuse of path segments TBH.

If I were to embrace this approach, I can see that I would have to
reprogram my server to do some additional path preprocessing magic. I
could either:

1. Check every sequence of path segments starting from the document root
   to see if any of them correspond to an executable file or have the
   blessed CGI file extension for my server.

2. (To use Chris Babcock's suggestion), check every sequence of path
   segments starting from the document root to see if any of them
   correspond to a directory containing an index.cgi file.

3. Include an input parameter to my server (on the command line or in a
   config file) that specifies a particular mapping between path
   segments and CGI scripts on my filesystem. That is, I would be
   defining a routing table at server start time. This approach has the
   unfortunate side effect of preventing users on a pubnix from
   installing CGI scripts in their ~/public_gemini capsules without
   getting the server administrator to update the global routing table
   on their behalf. Alternatively, it would require each ~/public_gemini
   capsule to include a routing table config file within it if it wanted
   to support CGI scripts, and these would have to be read and parsed by
   the server both at server start time and/or on a periodic interval or
   event-based basis in order to support new user scripts as they are
   added without having to restart the server.

Once one of these 3 approaches enables the server to successfully detect
that a particular path corresponds to a CGI script that is not actually
located where that path is pointing, then the server would need to
execute that script with PATH_INFO bound to the entire path. Every
installed CGI script would then be responsible for manually removing
SCRIPT_NAME from PATH_INFO and splitting it up to get the user inputs,
which puts an additional burden on CGI developers.


So I've now heard from multiple folks that we should all just get on
with these path segment hacks and accept that as the best we can do in
Gemini.

While I can see that it's technically possible (though arguable ugly) to
do so, I suppose my question is:

"What exactly does Gemini lose by allowing chained query parameters?
(with &)"

I can't for the life of me see any downside. It should literally be one
line of code changed in your favorite Gemini client. Just append inputs
to the query string if one already exists rather than replacing the
query string outright.

I believe John Cowan is right that "include" is too vague a word in
Solderpunk's current specification for the 10 INPUT field. Both
appending and replacing are forms of inclusion, so any Gemini client
author who chooses to append shouldn't be in violation of the spec as it
is currently worded.

And changing that one line in your client could save every CGI script
writer in Geminispace a lot of additional work (as clearly demonstrated
by the examples shared by Katarina, Chris, and Sean).

Seems like a very positive return on investment for a small change.

What am I missing here, folks?

Any chance of weighing in here, Solderpunk?


With best intentions,
  Gary

Message-ID: <c079f240aa9aae4becd91d2e4546b7cfaa322102.camel@wetterberg.nu>

Hi all,

I read Omar Polos mail to the list yesterday and realised that maybe
it's time to stop lurking and actually say hi.?

I'm running a personal capsule on gemini://capsule.wetterberg.nu/ that
mostly has been about Gemini application development. I used the
christmas break to get started on some projects that had been brewing in
the back of my head since I started reading the CAPCOM feed. It's a joy
to work in such a restricted design space after many years of web and
information system development work.

My projects are avaliable here gemini://repos.wetterberg.nu/ and on
Sourcehut. A quick round-up:

gemini-git: serves up my public Sourcehut git repositories as a gemini
capsule, it's what runs the repos subdomain.

gemini-paper: creates a daily digest as a PDF or ePUB document using a
list of gemsub/Atom/RSS subscriptions. I use this to get a morning
newspaper delivered to my e-reader.
gemini://capsule.wetterberg.nu/2021/2021-01-06-the-daily-newspaper.gmi

gemlog-server: is a git-driven gemlog server that I use to publish my
posts. The workflow is described here:
gemini://capsule.wetterberg.nu/2021/2021-01-07-gemlog-server.gmi

gemini-cfdocs: is a pretty niche service that lets me (and anyone else
that occupies this unprobable venn diagram slice) access the AWS
Cloudformation docs in a non-horrible way.

gemini-proxy: is a proxy service that allows me to expose the different
gemini servers on a standard port on the same server.

gemini-ignorant: is a gemini-to-http proxy for all those people we care
about even if they don't care about gemini.


Thank you for being a more human-friendly, and human-driven alternative
to an increasingly hostile web.

Cheers,
Hugo Wetterberg

  That's a particular implementation detail of GLV-1.12556 [1].  Other
servers could require the extension, or some other mechanism.

  I see your server just accepts the requested path as is.  GLV-1.12556
(once it gets into the filesystem handler) walks down the document root
checking each path segment looking for an exectuable file (which indicates a
CGI script) or symbolic link (which indicates a SCGI script).

  If you want to follow RFC-3875, that's not the case.  PATH_INFO only
contans data past the script name (section 4.1.5). This link:

	gemini://gemini.conman.org/cgi

returns

	SCRIPT_NAME = /cgi

There is no PATH_INFO or PATH_TRANSLATED because it's not needed.  However:

	gemini://gemini.conman.org/cgi/path/to/nowhere

returns

	SCRIPT_NAME = /cgi
	PATH_INFO = /path/to/nowhere
	PATH_TRANSLATED = /home/spc/projects/gemini/non-checkin/gemini.conman.org/path/to/nowhere

  The work is on the server side, not the CGI script side.

  Nothing as far as I can see, as long as the characters '=' and '&' are
escaped if they appear in the input (to prevent confusion).

  Somebody to do a proof-of-concept probably.

  You don't split the query.  You pass it in, as is, from the request, in
QUERY_STRING.  Play around with:

	gemini://gemini.conman.org/cgi

It will show all the variables, command line arguments and a breakdown of
the query string.

  Warning about my server---the CGI implementation also allows one to run
CGI scripts for a webserver (and Apache in particular) so be aware of that.

  It's not as HTTP-specific as it may seem---the only bit where it's an
issue is the REQUEST_METHOD.  My server sets it to "" (as there is no method
for Gemini, and what I think it should be, given RFC-3875 makes it
mandatory); others set it to "GET".  Aside from that, it's quite generic.

Hello here !

I just published sphinx-gemini-builder on PyPi to create
websites and blogs from sphinx documentation tool
(https://www.sphinx-doc.org). I need to work a lot more to
generate Atom feeds with ablog (https://ablog.readthedocs.io/).

I'm using this module for my new gem blog (gemini://kujiu.org
in french) and for a non-profit organization
(gemini://nerv-project.eu in french). It'll be compatible with
a lot of software documentations. I think Atom generation will
be good in one week.

To use this module, you can just do :

    pip install sphinx-gemini-builder

And in your documentation directory :

    make gemini

Thanks for this protocol !

Have a good day.

Has anyone tried porting one of the Python implementations to CircuitPython or MicroPython? 

A microcontroller-based Gemini server would be a good match for a solar powered capsule.

Just remembered there's work being done on embedded Rust so maybe the agate server running on ESP32?

No idea if SSL would work though.

Thanks for providing that page.  I played a bit with it while fixing my
CGI implementation and now I believe gmid behaves just like GLV-1.12556
does (minus the argument list).  I have to do some changes in order to
access the raw query string when I'm about to execute the CGI script.

One thing that your page doesn't show are the TLS-related environment
variables.  I remember you wrote about them in a previous message on
this list.

I built a similar page, hosted at

	gemini://gemini.omarpolo.com/cgi/env

Right, skimming through it gave me the wrong impression.  That are
various places were HTTP is blatantly assumed (just grep 404), but
otherwise it seems easily applicable to Gemini.

  Ah.  To see those, use a client certificate and go here:

	gemini://gemini.conman.org/private/cgi-sample

> I built a similar page, hosted at

> 	gemini://gemini.omarpolo.com/cgi/env

  Cool.  But you only set AUTH_TYPE and REMOTE_USER if a client certificate
is present, otherwise, they're not set.  Same for the TLS_* variables. 

  Also, PWD, LANG and LC_COLLATE aren't required (they're not part of the
CGI spec).  I included LANG to ensure proper charset usage of any program
executed, LC_COLLATE just because and PATH (not PWD) in case I need to
execute a Unix command from a CGI script.

Hello everybody!

We're super happy to introduce you to our Gemini directory. Its goal is
to provide an easy way to dive into the Geminispace. It's also meant to
be a tool for discovering new capsules, and let the serendipity happen.

It's all human indexed and curated. Right now it already includes a
hundred links organised in categories. Of course, we're going to add
more capsules over time.

It's still in its early stage, and there may be some typos left. Don't
hesitate to tell us if you see one.

We're always looking for more cool content, so please email us if your
favourite capsules are missing.

We'll soon add some kind of crawler to regularly check the links and
certs, because a directory filled with dead links is a sad directory.

So, here it is: gemini://medusae.space

We hope you'll enjoy it.

Subject: Another text/gemini to html, but in AWK
Message-ID: <CAPnjUn8y1mgj0tLrkdA-orn1HRQbb9T7+3G-vjy3tyt4X0BMAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi! I just made another `text/gemini` to html translator, but this
time written in AWK.

It might not be the fastest translator, but I think it's fast enough.
On a tp-link mr320 (with only 32mb of ram and just 265.42 BogoMIPS) it
can convert a 15.2K gemini file in 0.149s, and 1000 of them in just
under 10 minutes. Also, it is short, just 135 lines of code, which
includes some "fancy" stuff like changing local links to gmi files to
point to the html version.

Maybe someone will find a use for it.

Here is the code:

As an experiment to learn CGI coding for Gemini, I have written a Gemini
gateway to the news site https://dw.com

As with the original, there are 30 language sites, news and background
articles.

All of course, strictly as a hobby, based on public data and not at all
endorsed by DW.

There are a lot of options so it'd be nice to give people an easy way to pick one that suits them.

There's an "awesome" list which is actively maintaned but still lacks some info for sure:
https://github.com/kr1sp1n/awesome-gemini
Patches are welcome!

There has been a discussion about a "curated" list of tools in geminispace with some
more information to allow interested users make a informed decision.
To my knowledge the Random Road Directory gemini://directory.randomroad.net is the only
approach that comes close to this request.

It is, thanks. (Managing a crawler is a very good way to test the
health of the geminispace.)

You're not alone, these capsules have the same problem:

consensus.circumlunar.space
gem.bestalbumsintheuniverse.com
typed-hole.org
vger.cloud

This is the sort of case where you regret the Server: header of HTTP,
which may be would show the software they use, allowing a global bug
report.

Ah thanks St?phane, this should be fixed for typed-hole.org. I'm using 
my own server which isn't used by anybody else AFAIK.

Indeed.

If I were less lazy, I would notify all the capsulemasters of the
technical problems detected by the Lupa crawler (there are many; as
Melisandre said, the geminispace is large and full of errors).

But the last time I did that, his email server rejected my message
claiming that my IP address is blacklisted.

For some reason the Medusae category links don't seem to work well on the vulpes proxy

They do fine on amphora, so, the issue might be with the proxy (??)

Hey folks,

Found Gemini a few days ago, poked around (it's quite lovely here!) and
decided to start my own capsule (running Jetforce on a Digital Ocean
Debian machine). You can check it out at gemini://voidpoems.voyage

I'll mainly be posting short haiku-like poems (newest ones can be found
on latest, which I'll add to every few days) as well as slightly longer
poetry projects and haibun. Might start a gemlog as well some time in
the near future, but for now I'll just focus on poetry. Glad to be here
and thanks for creating such an awesome space!

Cheers,
Conor

Oh, you're right. I guess that's because we've used relative links
with a dot-slash format. Is that something that should'nt be used for
gemini links?

We'll change it tomorrow.

Thank you for the report.

Well, no, I'm stupid... It's just that vulpes seems to not be able to
accept urls with queries (?). Any capsule that use this kind of URL or
is waiting for client input is broken on vulpes.

I'm sorry, I can't do anything to fix this.

Vulpes also doesn't display preformatted blocks if they start on the
first line of the document. It has lots of weird bugs and trying to
change your site because it doesn't work on vulpes is a pointless
endeavor because it has so many weird behaviors. Not accepting queries
in links? Why would it even strip those out?

Hello all!

I see that GUS hasn't updated its index for about two months.  But now
there is gemini://geminispace.info/ (based on GUS, I assume code-wise),
and it appears to be indexing new capsules.  Is GUS no longer managed?

Thanks!

Hi,

i had a short conversation with Natalie and Remco
a few days ago. GUS is still maintained but Natalie 
is currently short of time for various reasons. 
Index updates on GUS currently require manual action
to happen, thats why it's lacking behind.

geminispace.info hopped in as an alternative (NOT a replacement!)
to GUS. I think it's always good to have alternatives ready of need be.
It's based on the same code as GUS and all relevant changes 
i make will be sent to Natalie as well.

regards

Ah, good to know! ?I completely understand it's not meant as a
replacement, and that makes sense. ?I remember in the early days of the
WWW, we had multiple search engines to choose from that would provide
different results depending on what you were looking for, long before
Google came in and ate everything up.

I appreciate your work on the project!

Thanks!

Message-ID: <87r1ltikge.fsf@omarpolo.com>

Hello,

I'd like to announce GemPKG, a CGI script to search and explore the
OpenBSD package collection over Gemini.  It's available at

    gemini://gemini.omarpolo.com/cgi/gempkg

It's a simple python script that uses the sqlite database provided by
the sqlports package and features full-text search, per-category
listings and port pages.  It tracks OpenBSD-CURRENT, and is
automatically update every couple of days.

The sources are here[0][1], but please keep in mind that it's the first
time I write in python, don't cringe too much.  Patches and/or PR are
welcome :)

--

For the more technical inclined: I have a robots.txt that should exclude
all the pages from most bots, but I would appreciate if somebody could
double check if it's correct.  My reasoning is:
 - disallow archivers: it's all dynamically generated data, and if
   you're interested in preserving it, backup the CVS repository!
 - disallow indexers: I don't want to overload GUS & co with 10'000+ pages
 - disallow researcher: it doesn't represent the geminispace IMHO
 - allow webproxies: these are legit users

Hi all, I've searched around a bit, but I cannot seem to find an answer to my problem. I have this enteka.xyz gemini, gopher and website.

So I set these three up and saw no issues. However at some point the https//enteka.xyz stopped working. I wasn't much bothered as at the time I was basically done with it. However, I'm uploading a "gamebook" (the Choose your own adventure type + some "virtual dice") done on JS and so I needed a website. 

I thought on setting up a new domain name, server and all for that, but thought it would be a waste. So, I've added ipv6 support, and reset the server and the website is back. However, I might have done something wrong before because the website stopped working the first time when I activated the gemini server.

So, not sure if I missed something that could have made my whole setting unstable. Or should I just have separate domain names as a best practice?

Hi!

Did you remember what kind of error you were encountering?

What server did you use? I remember having read that some people
experienced crashes with gemserv, for example.

You could look at the logs of your server, may that could help.

The builds are for x86, raspberry pis are ARM. you'll have to clone the

More info needed. What software (distro, gemini/web/gopher server, etc.) 
are you running?

Have you tried the following:

- De-activate the Gemini server and see if the website starts working
- Re-start the web server

Check your configs to make sure that your Gemini, Gopher, and Web 
servers are using the correct ports.

>Or should I just have separate domain names as a best practice?

No, this isn't needed. In fact, keeping one domain is probably better.

You're also welcome to pop into the #gemini IRC channel on tilde.chat 
for help.

I forgot to hit Reply-All so here's the gist of what I said, for anyone else
who has this problem:

That is indeed an ARM64 build, which is the architecture of the Raspberry Pi 4.
However the Raspberry Pi OS (which I assume you're running) is still only a
32-bit OS. This means it won't run ARM64 binaries. Instead you should download
the binary called linux_armv7, which is 32-bit and compatible with RPi4 I believe.

seglar92 replied and said that worked.

  I can get to each of the web, gopher and gemini sites without any issues. 
The only thig I can think of that might cause a problem is if you try to run
two different services on the same port, but that doesn't seem to be the
issue here.

  You also didn't mention what webserver or gopher server you are using.

  -spc (who runs Apache for the web, port70 [1] for gopher, and GLV-1.12556
	[2] for Gemini)

Hello,

I just learned about Gemini recently, and decided to create a capsule. 
I'm not quite sure yet what kind of content I should put on it, but it 
was fun setting it up!

I've enjoyed browsing other people's content, it's kind of a zen 
experience compared to being on the Web. I'm using the Agate server, and 
my URL is gemini://jmajeremy.com

That's the good thing about open data (in that case, the XML file
exported from the FOSDEM scheduling software Pentabarf), you can

I'm not sure if Agate could run on an ESP32 and am not qualified to talk much about embedded Rust. But I think ESP-IDF has support for TLS, so if there is a Rust wrapper for that, it would probably not be a problem. It would maybe require to use a different TLS library, which is a feasible change.

Hi everyone,

WikDict provides bilingual dictionaries for a large set of languages and is
now available over Gemini at gemini://gmi.wikdict.com . It's not as
advanced as the web version yet, but should be usable. Please give it a
try! Both the source code and data are free (MIT and CC-BY-SA).

I also made my blog available at gemini://gmi.karl.berlin/ .

Feedback is welcome,
Karl

Hi all,

Some of you may or may not be aware that Stephane Bortzmeyer gave a talk at
FOSDEM to do with Gemini.

I watched it, it was awesome, and Stephane handled the questions really well!

Really well done, Stephane.

The Raspbery Pi Zero could be a nice match. It's tiny, can do wifi and bluetooth (the W version of it) and can probably work well on solar power (or AAA rechargable batteries).

Subject: my Gemini inspired website small design
Message-ID: <b191ce25-b823-4bb0-9c44-c236b0d88b33@www.fastmail.com>

Thanks all for you help on solving my gemini/website fiasco. Anyway, I went and decided to use my space in the web to be an auxiliary site to my gemini capsule.

One thing I've done is to "geminify" my CSS which is just this bit:

```
* {
font-family: 'Courier New', courier, monospace;
font-size: 1.2rem;
line-height: 1.33;
margin: 0 auto;
font-weight: normal;
}
html {background: #003300;}
body { max-width: 800px; padding: 7vh 5vw; background: beige; min-height: 100vh;}
main { margin: 3vh auto;}
h1 {font-size: 1.55555rem; margin: 3rem auto;}
h2,h3 {margin: 1rem -.5rem;}
h2 {border-bottom: thick solid black;}
h3 {width: max-content; border-bottom: thick solid black;}
a {display: block; margin: .25rem auto; text-indent: 1rem; text-decoration: none;}
a::before {content: "=> ";}
p + a, a + p {margin-top: 1rem;}
p {margin: .5em auto}
p + p {text-indent: 1rem}
footer {font-size: 80%;}
```
All elements, but the main h1 and the footer will use the same font size. There is no bold letters, and it's all, hopefully on Courier New. Text background is beige to be easy on the eyes and still provide contrast, and our familiar => replace underline text as the visual mark of a link.

Which is nothing too weird but for the a {display:block} hack/trickery/me being naughty(?). The reason being I want to force links to go in separate lines, just as in Gemini, but without having to enclose them in either the over-used divs, li or p tags. 

It's all in Spanish, and there's not much content, but if any of you are interested enough I'm enteka.xyz on the three protocols.

My client *could* support HTML, but I chose not to enable it because..
why would I. I'm using aerc (https://aerc-mail.org) and I was just
really confused when I saw that, hence why I asked. I think you can turn
off HTML in most browsers now.

In Gmail there is an option for plain text mode. When you're composing 
an e-mail, just click on the "three dots" menu (lower right, next to the 
trash can) and select "plain text mode".

[Found in the database of the Lupa crawler]

Russian just appeared among the languages in the Geminispace. Only one
capsule tags its content in russian, <gemini://spline-online.tk/> but
note there are other russian-speaking capsules, without language tags,
such as <gemini://hugeping.tk/>.

There is only one page tagged in german, and it is a translation of
the Gemini specification
<gemini://qwertqwefsday.eu/specification.de.gmi>. Any other
translations somewhere?

Only one capsule tags texts as korean and it's beautiful (at least
with Lagrange):
<gemini://namu.blue/gemlog/2020-10-02-????_?_??_??.gmi>.

Nothing in arabic, hindi, tamil or chinese (mandarin) spotted yet.

That is what I have to clean up at work when people insist on writing
everything in Microsoft Word and paste it into whatever they use for
sending data. Sometimes, it's so much metadata that they exceed the limits
of the field even though it's a short message.

We've also found yesterday a bunch of russian gemini capsules (Voskhod 
capsules?). Can't wait to see more other languages in the geminispace!

Now you can find your favourite radio station in Gemini space.
I've created a directory of over 29'000 internet radio stations with direct stream links:

gemini://gemini.tunerapp.org/

Suggestions are very welcome.

I'm the developer of the Linux app "Tuner" and love to contribute to Gemini.

It seems ???????.?? is not supported [1], and ??????.?? (without Acute accent) is already registered.
Anyway ??????.?? is not registered at the moment (eurid does not allow the Acute accent either).

[Not tagged since there is no obvious tag for this subject.]

Gemini seems to have some success
<gemini://gemini.bortzmeyer.org/software/lupa/stats.gmi> but one day
or the other, we'll have to move further and tries to promote it to
normal people. This is what is done for systems like PeerTube
<https://joinpeertube.org/> (or <https://joinfediverse.org/>, which
seems to be in french only) with a Web site explaining what it is, how
to join, etc, targeted to real people.

Now, don't get me wrong, I do not suggest to launch such a Web site
tomorrow. Gemini is not stable enough, the specification is not final,
and most Gemini programs are not yet packaged for typical operating
systems.

But creating such an "outreach" Web site takes time so may be it could
be a good idea to start working on it? (I have no special competences
on that field, I just suggest a joingemini.org could be cool.)

Such a project would be a great addition to the Gemini project. 

The domain you propose is still available, someone would have to spend the money for the domain to register. I can do that and would be willing to hold the domain in trust. However, I don't want to build a site like this myself.

And on the other hand, who would take the time to maintain the site, respond to issues and implement changes and translations requested by the community? It'll take some time and you won't get anything for it. Except some community love of course :-).

So if you want me to shell out the $12 for the domain, I would be glad to do it.

By turing test I am convinced that more than 0 people on this mailing
list are also "real", but I get your point.

The only email from solderpunk this year so far mentioned moving stuff
to another domain [1], which would be the right place for such a page.

This is probably the more interesting problem, a version of the classical
lack of content. But if there is a specific point to contribute, that
would probably be helpful.

IMHO, this is the smallest problem. Creating a Web site that will both
appeal to people and will follow some Gemini principles (of course,
having a lot of Javascript and cookies on this Web site would be
contradictory with our goals), is the difficult part.

YouTubers are already doing this, sometimes with otherwordly click-bait like "let's replace the Web with Gemini" or something along those lines.

I've been thinking on commenting on those but, a) I have youtube on my etc/hosts as 0.0.0.0 and b) I've been like a month and a bit on Gemini (and yet I seem to know more than those youtubers... dear, dear)

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq1k_FCWPXk> "Gemini Is What The Web
Should Have Been" is quite good (but not what I thought about when I
talked about "outreach to real people", specially when he launches
Agate, and of course the surrounding environment of his video is not
made for Mr Smith).

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YzN4hAnvSQ> "The Modern Web Is
Bloated, Use Gemini Instead!" is more questionable for instance when
it says there is no search engine but it does the job, although
probably not what an outreach Web site would do.

One of the issues with outreach is that you don't talk the same to
people who just want to browse the geminispace and people who want to
publish content.

Welcome!

Just a heads up, you should be putting the ASCII art on your homepage in a 
preformatted block, so clients know to use a monospace font. Like so:

Can you explain more clearly what your poetry requires beyond the
plain-text formatting of ```...``` sections?  The only thing I can think of
is that it will appear in a monowidth font.

Enviroments. We already have one: plain text. We could have something like

The spaces should be preserved already because of the ```.

Interesting new RFC: the HTTP people recognize the dangers of headers,
specially for privacy, so they create a way for the server to announce
the headers it will use. For instance, it allows the client *not* to
send User-Agent: if the server does not use it. It also allows surveys
of server's practices.

I am getting the same error in Kristall and Lagrange (written in C++
and C). Amfora and gemget (Go) and AV-98 (Python) works as expected.

I am on a system with libressl 3.1.5.

Strange, I tested it in Lagrange and it works fine.
I also see that the server (agate on an DigitalOcean droplet) is running fine.

Could that be some issue with SSL?

"t this point, the [spec] topic of the mailing list will be retired,
and the project will transition to a new phase where the primary
ongoing technical activity is to translate that speculative
specification into a more precise and formal technical document, with
the goal that it might eventually be submitted to formal internet
standard organisations like IETF and IANA."

A similar sounding issue was raised on the Agate repo yesterday, maybe that helps?

I've updated all the package (running Debian 10) and restartet the server. I'll probably try another server tonight.

Question to all who have issues: do you perhaps use IPv6?

Thank you for telling! 

I must admit that I didn't test IPv6, I just created the AAAA record with the IPv6 address DO told me and started agate with the option: --addr [::]:1965. This was probably wrong.

I'm not very experienced with IPv6 so I remove the AAAA record until I can test that properly.

Thank you all for your support.

I was getting a random IPv6 address when querying:

$ drill gemini.tunerapp.org AAAA 
...SNIP...
2a03:b0c0:3:d0::12ea:2001
...SNIP...

I had to put your ipv4 address in my host file and I could access it
perfectly fine after that.  I had the same issue with cetacean.club too.

Subject: Proposal to drop double slashes from URL syntax
Message-ID: <87eehpz0c6.fsf@posteo.de>

Hello,

I want to propose to drop the double slashes from the gemini URL 
syntax.

The reason for this is that they dont serve any semantic value and 
while the
project is still young, I think it could still be changed. So 
instead of

    gemini://example.com

we would have:

    gemini:example.com

In fact, Sir Tim Berners-Lee apologized[0] for introducing them in 
the http URL
syntax. I see the following advantages and disadvantages:

Advantages:
  - Less typing
  - Less wasted screenspace
  - Less transfered bytes and less stored bytes on disk and memory

Disadvantages:
  - Newcomers might see familiarities with http in the double 
  slashed syntax and
    recognize, that the following token is a hostname, which will 
    be contacted.
    There is a chance that, without the slashes, newcomers might 
    expect
    something else than a hostname after the color, although I 
    personally think
    that chance is low.
  - Implementations would need to adapt to this and some URL 
  parsers in their
    respective languages might not support the parsing of such 
    syntax.
  - Automatic URL detectors, like for example a terminal emulators 
  where you can
    click on a URL and it openes, might have trouble detecting 
    this URL form and
    therefore not recognize links. Those terminal emulators would 
    need adaption.

Of course, the double slashed syntax could still be supported, but 
the more
compact format could be encouraged. Any feedback or suggestions 
would greatly be
welcomed.

Regards,
Daniel

No.

One of the reasons Gemini uses URLs is because the URL syntax is a
*standard*. Gemtext allows linking to things that are accessible through
any other protocol for which there exists a URL scheme. In order for a
different-protocol link to be handled by a client for that protocol, it
is important that the link is a valid, standard URL. And it does not
make sense to use nonstandard fake URLs for gemini links and real URLs
for other protocols.

URIs are already standardized:
 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986

specifically in Section 3.3 you'll find the description about //.

I don't think changing gemini URIs to a non-standard format would bring any advantage to the project.

I don't really feel like the benefits of this are worth the drawbacks 
that we would be breaking the URL standard, breaking existing 
URL-handling libraries, just breaking things for the sake of, what, 
saving two bytes? I don't think it's worth it. If you want to save 
screen space, just don't display the gemini://, if you are in a gemini 
client it is safe to assume you are speaking gemini (many web browsers 
don't display the "https://" for similar reasons)

Hello Gemini mailing list,

My name's Chris Were and I run a small PeerTube/YouTube. Please forgive 
any breach in protocol, I'm not used to mailing lists.

I noticed that YouTubers were mentioned as part of gemini outreach and 
wanted to let you all know that I, for one, am incredibly excited to be 
part of this growing community of talented individuals. I'm no-where 
near as knowledgable as those on this list, but I'm thoroughly enjoying 
learning about self-hosting and this amazing new internet protocol.

I'm open to feedback as to how I might help grow the community, but I 
also understand there's a degree of animosity about YouTubers. I'd just 
like to say that I really hope to be a constructive community member 
when it comes to gemini outreach and I'm sure speak others in that 
sentiment. We may get things wrong, but I assure you all that our hearts 
are in the right place.

I'll be talking about gemini more on my channel, but I'd like to ask the 
list; are there are any specific things you'd like people to know, such 
as common misconceptions, or certain strengths gemini has? Is there any 
misinformation about gemini out there you feel might need correcting?

I don't know about the others, but I for myself would like if you could
"shout out" some cool gemini capsules you found, either useful or just
fun. Might just be me tho :D

Hi. I have a question regarding the gemini browsers. I came across gemini
recently and I was wondering about the browsers.

Please correct me if I am wrong in any of my understandings.

It seems one of the key components of the gemini project is that once the
client makes a request to the server, the server fills the request and then
the connection closes.

Also - gemini does not have inline image displays.

My question is - would it be against gemini protocol to build a browser
that would be able to open audio files or http audio streams as well as
image files in the same window? Or - has this already been done?

Thank you!

Lagrange supports playing audio.

Why?  It's up to the browser to decide that behaviour.  Lagrange (from
a graphical browser) displays things in-line, but can be told not to.

As for console browsers, doing that becomes harder, and not worthwhile.

In theory, a client can do whatever it wants.  There are some guidelines
that defines "best practices" that client authors should follow (like
don't make requests behind the user back etc).

There is at least one browser that I know, Lagrange[0], that is able to
display images inline (upon user request), but there can be others too.

My personal take is that user privacy and control are cornerstone
principles of the Gemini project, and to me that implies that user agents
should maximize user choice.  Auto-loading images could lead to user
tracking, and users should be in charge of when and how they expose
themselves to such.

But then again, who would use a web browser that didn't show pictures?  Not
many.

A pragmatic choice (and one I'm taking in my own browser) is to have a
setting to enable inline image display.

Just my two cents.

I completely agree with you, I just wanted to emphasise that it's
an important cultural thing, as nothing really prevents clients to start
auto-downloading images, pre-fetching pages and all that evil stuff.

Not sure whether there's animosity against YTers per se...? In any
situation where you see someone explaining something when their
experience with / understanding of it is smaller than yours, it is a bit
weird.

I think there's a general acceptance that people can and will discuss
Gemini in any way they like, and that Gemini will become more widely
known to some extent. There is some disagreement about how popular
Gemini would ideally be, but at least I (and I hope most would agree)
think the popularity of Gemini is something that we should let go as it
goes.

What metalune said, plus maybe the following two answers to common
reactions if you encounter those reactions frequently:

- section 2.5 of the FAQ
- to "But I would like to make things look nice": Gemini is focused on
text content, and the idea is that rather than the author determining
how they want readers to view it, the readers should determine how they
want to view it; and as it's text content, a reader probably wants to
view everything the same way.

Hello everyone,

I feel like I'm late to the party, but I discovered Gemini through a
YouTube video this past weekend, and I'm already hooked. It reminds me
so much of my early days on the Internet.

I wrote up a small document with some random thoughts on what it all
means to me:

gemini://loomcom.com/thoughts.gmi

I look forward to watching as Gemini continues to grow!

My initial mail should have made that clearer. I was not talking 
about removing
the double-slashes of every link you can find in a Gemtext 
document. I was only
talking about gemini URI scheme links. http links ( and all other 
urls ) should
stay exactly the same as they are.

Also, to my understanding removing them does not violate the 
standard. For
example, `tel:+1-816-555-1212` and `magnet:?xt=urn:sha1:...` are 
valid URIs. A
Gemini browser might choose to recognize those `tel:` and 
`magnet:` links and a
open a locally installed VoiP client or Torrent client 
respectively. My initial
assumption was that some of the simpler parsers might not 
recognize this format.
If they adhere to the URI standard it should be fine.

There is some confusion regarding the terms URI and URL. The W3C 
tries to clear
that up[0]. It used to be that they ment different things in what 
they call the
"classical view" but this difference isn't as dominant anymore in 
the
"contemporary view". In my understanding, a scheme, which would be 
`gemini:`,
can define upon its own what it expects after the colon. You can 
find more
registered schemes here[1], some of which require a double-slash, 
some don't.

Even though the difference seems small, in the amount of links out 
there I think
this small difference can add up.

Best,
Daniel

To preserve privacy, it's best to only display inline images from the same host.

Displaying inline images at all goes somewhat against the vision for Gemini (see the FAQ [1]), but as long as it's constrained to the same host, and to a reasonable file size, I don't see anything wrong with it.

They are valid URIs, because these schemes do not use the "authority"
component of the URI syntax. The authority is for the hostname, port,
and userinfo. The double slash is grouped with the authority component
and is required by the URI standard to be present when the authority
component is used and to be absent when it is not used. Gemini URIs
always need to specify the hostname, so there is always an authority
component, and to be standard-compliant the double slash cannot be left out.

The URI standard[1] says that if an "authority" is present in a URI, it
MUST be preceded by "//".  If an authority is not present, it
MUST NOT be preceded by two forward slashes.  A magnet link does not
have an authority because it is content addressed via a peer to peer
network, and an authority is only used when one central authority (for
instance the IANA for domain names) dictates the allocation and
structure of identifiers within that space.

[1]: RFC3986, in particular:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#appendix-A  (ABNF of a URI)
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.2 (Description of an
                                                 authority)

The W3C deals exclusively with http and its derivative protocols (https,
etc), so we are not held to standards they pass (although we
unfortunately have to deal with the fallout sometimes).

In conversational terms, or even in technical discussion by
implementers, yes they have different meanings than they used to.
However, when you're dealing with standards, you have to use formally
defined words and as such the "classical" meanings of URI/URL/URN are
what is generally used on /this list/ because we^Weveryone else loves to
bikeshed the spec a lot.

Also, the gemini spec specifically says:

https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.html Section 1.2

Now, this is obviously what you're talking about changing, but there's
good reasons to be compliant with the URI spec (which, as previously
mentioned, mandates "//" precedes an authority).  The most compelling
reason being that there's a URI library for every programming language
that's ever been used in the past 30 years, and a main goal of gemini is
to reuse existing specifications where it's not necessary to save people
the trouble of having to roll their own everything.  This is the same
reason that gemini uses DNS and TLS despite their respective problems.
They already exist, they're standardized, and they're well used by
everyone already.


I hope I don't seem rude here, I'm just trying to lay out the general
position clearly.

That's the only real advantage I see of this proposal. (Humans are lazy)
However as it was already explained it is a part of the URL/URI 
standard, without which we couldn't reuse already existing code and we 
would have to add special cases everywhere.

There are two scenarios one would want to type less:
* The address bar of a broser
* Hand written gemini markup

For browser address baers you can add special cases and whatever bells 
and whistles and autocompletion you like as most webbrowsers currently 
do, just make sure that documents that do not conform to the standard 
get what they deserve.

For your gemini documents just use relative uris by leaving out the 
scheme or the path.

# Example
=> gemini://example.org/some_file.gmi
=> //example.org/some_file.gmi
=> /some_file.gmi

If you got the ones above in any document served over gemini from a 
server at example.org they will all point to the same resource

I agree, adhering to a widely used standard and therefore being 
able to
use well established libraries is important. My expectation was, 
that it
would be compatible to the standard, but it looks like it is not.

What also contributed to this expectation is that I can still
differentiate where a hostname ends and a path starts, since 
hostnames
cannot contain slashes.

No rudeness experience from here. Thank you for your clarifying

I am happy to have learned about gemini and hope that I can help

  All right.  Let's assume we do this.  Let's start with an existing link:

	gemini://gemini.conman.org/test/torture/0001

and work our way through the first few entries with the new style.  The
first is a full link in the Gemini document:

	gemini:gemini.conman.org/test/torture/0002

That works.  Our client can get the second page.  The next is a schemeless
link, wihch *is* valid in text/gemini documents (but not as the request). 
This will now look like:

	gemini.conman.org/test/torture/0003

Here we hit our first potential snag---do we have a hostname or not?  In
fact, here are the links from the next few tests using your proposal:

	/test/torture/0005
	007
	/test/../test/torture/0009

And to further mess with things, I could add a test 0051 with a relative
link to:

	gemini.conman.org

Do I mean the top level page of my sever?  Or the page

	/test/torture/gemini.conman.org

Because remember, you can have relative links in text/gemini documents, and
the hypothetical test 0051 has a path of

	/test/torture/0051

(and don't think I wouldn't do it).

  We're running over TLS.  There's already quite a bit of overhead, as I

Hello everyone!

After some time playing around in Gopher space, I decided to dive into
Gemini, because I consider it reaches the sweet spot between simple and
too simple.

I'm known as gluon online and this is my Gemini capsule:

Hi all,
known as ruenoak on the list.
with a bit of trial and error and help from Chris Were's Youtube 
tutorial, I finally go my Gemini server up and running.
Seem to be having a little trouble with text wrapping for some reason, 
not sure why yet.
Gemini is what I have been waiting for,? just clean beautiful text.

Maybe try generating your certificates with this:

that's what I use to generate my certificates

My experience with promoting Gemini is that, in almost every case, the
criticisms I hear against Gemini are addressed in the FAQ, section
2. And, most of the times, well addressed, in my opinion.

So, one could make an interesting video with each item of the FAQ.

Pre-fetching images THAT ARE ON THE SAME CAPSULE could be good for
privacy, because it would deprive the capsule's admin of some
knowledge (no way to know if the user really clicked).

Indeed, the problem is that the certificate is not issued for
cratermouse.com but for yourdomain.com:

% gnutls-cli -p 1965 cratermouse.com
...
- Certificate[0] info:
 - subject `CN=YOURDOMAIN.COM',

The specification
<gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.gmi> is silent
about that (a general problem of section 4) so all clients, whether
they accept or reject this certificate, are right.

There's a problem with the ASCII art, you should enclose it in ``` so
it's treated as a verbatim block; not every client uses monospace to
render the lines, and it could confuse screen readers and such :)

P.S.: you may want to check out elpher, an Emacs client for Gemini

They do serve a semantic value. They signify the beginning of the
authority portion of an URI. Not all URIs contain authorities, and
the authoriy means something in the sense that there is a standardized
way to interpret it. That you don't think that this semantic value is
important, or that it's an important characteristic of Gemini to rely
on existing standards is a different matter.

So to add to your list, further disadvantages:
- Can't rely as heavily on existing URI standards
- "Encouraged" standards lead to unreliable support

For those miniscule advantages I don't see why this should be
considered.

Indeed. i've encountered people discussing Gemini as something 
intended to supersede the Web, even though the opening text of 
gemini.circumlunar.space states:

> Gemini is a new internet protocol which:

That said, in terms of FAQ 1.1:

i prefer the latter perspective, as i think the former tends to 
encourage people to think of Gemini along the lines of, say, HTTP 
1.1 and HTML 3.2.

Thanks Omar Polo for the ASCII tip I will try it. I've heard about 
elpher, I'll give it a try.
metalune, I generated the keys again, I still get a self-signed and 
untrusted key warning in the Kristall browser. Kristall and Ariane on my 
phone are the only two browser I have installed at the moment i will 
need to add a few more for testing I'm thinking.

Thanks.

The problem were not the keys, regenerating them does not help. The
problem is the owner of the certificate (subject, in X.509 parlance),
which is yourdomain.com when it should be cratermouse.com.

 % gnutls-cli -p 1965 cratermouse.com

I didn't know Gemtext allows those. To me, for both , before and 
after, this
would be a file. The client should not guess what could be a 
hostname or a
directory. I thought, to switch hostnames in a document, you would 
have always
needed to write the full "gemini://". But with that scheme-less 
syntax, that
notation is even shorter.

Hi all!

I'm Martin from Augsburg, in the south of Germany. At first I'm happy to 
have found this nice community. I'm reading this list for a few days 
now. :-)

I'm planning to set up a server with English and German language 
support. I had some experiments with Agate, but in Agate one can set a 
language definition just for each and every single file or for the whole 
server.

Is there a Gemini server with language setting on directory level or 
such and otherwise just for hosting gemtext??

For me it seems, that there is nearly no German language content up to 
now, or at least I did not find it. So to lower the barrier for new 
German people interested in Gemini I'd like to provide some content 
instead just on my own weblog, where btw I did write an article about 
Gemini in German language:

https://herrdoering.de/de/gemini-minismalistisches-parallel-web/

Writing the link on an extra line is just to not confuse anybody ;-)

Later I'd like to learn Go and try coding a small game or bot or such. 
Since the protocol allows single line input this could be a fun thing.

Martin

Shameless self-promotion: gmid[0][1] supports location rules and lets
you customize the language.  A configuration like this would do the job:

    server "example.com" {
        cert "..."
        key  "..."
        root "..."

        # default lang...
        lang "en"

        # ... except for documents under the "de" directory.
        location "/de/*" {
            lang "de"
        }
    }

Cheers!

Same issue with Gemserv (unless I missed something in the
documentation). So, to have english and french content, I've setup two
vhosts, one for each language.

According to the Lupa crawler
<gemini://gemini.bortzmeyer.org/software/lupa/>, there are two pages
in german:

lupa=> SELECT url FROM Urls WHERE lang = 'de';
                      url

Just in case anyone else is as intrigued by the idea of Tor and Gemini together (or wants to read why I am excited by it...)

- I like Tor
- easy to self host (no DNS, no VPS or NAT holes)
- pretty darn anonymous
- safe for clients (protocol makes leaking client details hard)
- safer for server (tiny attack surface)

I wrote up this post on Gemini and Tor, along with some generic "why Gemini" stuff.

https://www.residualbits.org/posts/2021/02/why-gemini-hidden-capsules/

Here is the Gemini version (without the love letter to Gemini since if you are reading this you've probably drunk the Koolaid).

gemini://tilde.pink/~shardiame/2021/hidden_gemini.gmi

Over the coming weeks I have some plans to build up a self contained Gemini via. Tor Hidden Service server in GoLang.

Cheers!

After a discussion with some friends on a private Matrix room a couple
days ago, I was convinced of the need for a kind of Gemini "quickstart"
for completely non-technical users.

I've registered geminiquickst.art, and have been writing content for it,
but I haven't actually set the server up. Probably soon, once the main
page is up. So far, I have been focusing on the even more basic issue of
"what is a Gemini client, and how do I install one?", because this is
actually the first sticking point that people run into. I'm also going
to address the issue of how to find things to read.

*Hosting* is going to be a bigger issue, IMO. To my eyes, sites like
flounder.online and midnight.pub go a long way to make getting a Gemini
presence set up easier, but in discussion with my less technical
friends, I learned that things about their sign-up processes can be
off-putting and feel unsafe. I have thoughts about how to handle this,
but for now, I'm probably going to punt on the hosting section.

I'd *like* to fairly rapidly get hosting a Gemini capsule to be "as
simple as hosting a Geocities site in 1996", and from there, make
progress towards "as simple as having a LiveJournal in 2004", the catch
being is that I want to do this with as little Web Platform technology
as possible, and preferably none.

this could be done as simply offering a nextcloud hosting that leads
to a directory published on the gemini server. That's a bit overkill
but will be easy to access to non tech people I think.

Come to think of it, I do.

1. Increased browser complexity and attack surface.  Think of buffer overflows in graphics libraries.

2. Inline GIFs...  Distracting ads aside, I remember that time when a bunch of imbeciles targeted an epilepsy website with flashing animations in order to provoke seizures.  Let's not allow for any of that.  At the very least, inline GIFs should not auto-play.

3. Size bombs, the solution to which can lead to browser fingerprinting.  A gemtext page may link to enormous images.  Downloading them without the user's consent would be wrong, at least on limited mobile data connections.  So a responsible browser developer might limit the total size of inline images on each page.  But if each browser has a different size limit, servers can identify the user agent by checking how much of the payload was downloaded.  And if the size limit is user-configurable, those who change the setting can be fingerprinted... and we're back to the web.

I don't think this information is sensitive enough to warrant the complications outlined above.

So my recommendation to all Gemini browsers is to *follow the spec* and not display inline images:

> clients MUST NOT automatically make any network connections as part of displaying links whose scheme corresponds to a network protocol (e.g. links beginning with gemini://, gopher://, https://, ftp:// , etc.).

gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.gmi

The one exception I find acceptable regards web proxies, like https://proxy.vulpes.one/ . This is because they can block or resize huge images server-side, to avoid #3.  They can also block GIFs or put them behind static images, to tackle #2.  And #1 is already present in web browsers.

Hi Gemineers,

on one Gemini site I found some nice kind of ASCII art, but made with 
unicode chars. It was not made of block elements, but with bows and 
angles and such. So the chaacters looked out nicely set together.

Is there a *nix tool to print out such things, like banner, but more 
sophisticated? I liked that one very well. Or do such things need to be 
put together by hand?

You might want to look at FIGlet, which is a font renderer (it comes with a

I have been thinking on this issue, going further than poetry, we could have environments for ASCII art. An ASCII art mark could tell the client, "hey client this is an ASCII art if you are some screen reader, you might want to skip this environment"

Abstracts, this could be redered by the client as a centered block perhaps

Poetry, which would be kinda monospace in the sense that it respects the spacing but could use some user chosen font (at configuration)

All in all, enviroments could be more like extra bits of semantic data than the client might want to use.

Hello everyone,
I'm new here, and I've set up my Gemini capsule only a couple of days ago. I was writing a new article today when I had to reference a Web page, and I started thinking: What if there's a Web proxy for Gemini?

I've seen Gemini proxies for Web, but not the other way around. Instead of external links, writers can add a link via the proxy, and the readers can stay in Gemini and read the referenced article.

For example, if the proxy is at gemini://example.proxy, and the writer wants to link to https://example.com, they can add a link to gemini://example.proxy?https://example.com. When the proxy receives such a request, it can pass the link to Mozilla's readability script to clean it up, and then pipe the output through another script to convert it to gemtext. A link to the original Web page can be added to the top, in case the readability script couldn't do its job well enough. The output will be served to the user, and it will be cached for future requests (for one month, for example). 

Any ideas?

After reading the Gemini specification and FAQ 2.9 (Why not Markdown?) I realized that it should be possible to use Gemini as a source format for Markdown to allow integration into multi-format publishing toolchains for the web, PDF generation, ebooks, etc.

Inside the attached tarball is an implementation of the filter, imaginatively called gmi2mkd, in gawk.  The other files in the tarball are copyright information (MIT, go nuts), a sample Gemini file to test the filter's functionality, and a sample shell script to illustrate its use in a pipeline.

This uses Mozilla's readability script, but doesn't deal with caching.

I feel like the plaintext block already covers all these use-cases, if 
you respect the ability to have alt-text for ascii art (which is in the 
spec). The only thing I can see being a legitimate addition is the 
ability to specify languages multiple times per file in some way.

I have set up 
gemini://webgate.geminet.org/web.sh
for that occasion.

It's a simple cgi-script that uses gemget and duckling proxy.

I still need to patch duckling proxy to rewrite all the hrefs in the html document, so you can follow them without
leaving gemini, but for now, for a single referenced page on the web, it might already be useful.

That's certainly a thought! I'm not sure how straightforward a nextcloud
signup is. My current thinking is towards a cross-platform native GUI
app that provides a fully-integrated signup (within a ring of supporting
hosting providers), reading, and publishing (over scp/rsync). But I
don't currently have the sporks to implement it.

Hi, I'm the admin/creator of flounder.online. What about the sign up
process makes them feel unsafe? It seems pretty standard to me --
username/password registration -- are you suggesting something like
Google/Twitter/etc OAuth login?

Very nice, but what exactly do I put there?

``` ASCII-Art 
for ascii art? and why not ascii art or ASCII ART or...

``` code
for code?

``` poem
for poerty (let be me a bit cheeky here)

Is there a standard I am not aware of?

If it's up to every client designer then do I need to take a look to what every client programmer thinks is best?

I'd say that the ascii art bit is specially important. I've tried to check how my websites "sounded" though a screen reader and it was often a fine mess. So, I mean, imagine if your first experience of Gemini with all its promise of little else than text was somehting like "eee aa eee oou err comma comma dot ha ha" or something

As far as I read this you can put there whatever you want.

What I think about this is, that like in Markdown one could technically 
tag or mark what kind of code or fixed format text this is. This would 
force no client to implement anything, but would open possibilities to 
those, that want.

If we use this instead for alternate text, what means a different use, 
namely a human readable and maybe longer description of the following 
text, the first more technically use is not available anymore.

If I would have invented this I would technically mark the fixed text as 
in Markdown and additionally add those text on the closing uptickt - we 
have the leading and the closing upticks, why not use them both?

Especially for blind people it would be good if a screenreader could 
technically know what kind of fixed width text this is and handle it 
accordingly while still providing (blind) human readable meta information.

Just my two ?-cents...

Apparently you missed the last word. toggle "line". There is
nothing on this line but three back quotes.


```
code, poem, ascii art,
monospaced text  even   preserving     spaces :)
````

This is it.

Sorry, if this topic was already discussed. I joined the list only a few days ago.

Is GUS not indexing anymore? No statistics? Maybe we miss an exponential growth :-)


My plans are to serve information about gemini stuff and more in german: gemini://gemini.textkapseln.de/scs/

Many thanks to all who develop the gemini protocol and the gemini space!

You are right, just implemented it on my little cosmic.voyage space ship (Isla Ristol), which would be visible in Gemini some time soon. (Cosmic.voyage seems to be partial to gopher)

Anyway, still, I feel there should be some common standards for alt texts

Hi Geminauts,

yesterday with much help from Omar I managed to set up another capsule, 
this time one of the rare bilingual ones, German and later English language.

The next days I will convert more of my German language poems into gmi 
format. I feel, this is a really good format for writing poems. Before I 
was using Hugo and Markdown for it, but in Markdown every line has to 
end with two spaces, just for getting a linefeed. :-/

The English language part is empty up to now and will be filled by time 
with mostly Linux related insights, tricks and experiments.

  I tried it out and it appears that you aren't properly decoding the query
string.  This reference (which my client is sending):

	gemini://tilde.club/~filip/kjv/kjv.cgi?amos%3A1-5/evil

doesn't return anything.  If I send this request by hand (openssl s_connect
... )

	gemini://tilde.club/~filip/kjv/kjv.cgi?amos:1-5/evil

it does.

  And except for the search function, it's very similar to a section on my
site:

	gemini://gemini.conman.org/king_james_bible.gemini

I didn't know the problem with the URL decoding so I manualy added the 
symbols to conver in $QUERY_STRING.
I think I forgot to decode the %3A character.
Amfora browser didn't need decoding that one.
You are using a different browser I suppose?

Great to hear you found another way of using Duckling Proxy, but using 
it in this way does make for a more opaque and constrained web 
experience than it needs to. Really Duckling is intended as a scheme 
specific proxy - ie. you configure your client so it handles *any* web 
request transparently. In this way you don't need to rewrite any URLs 
and its always clear what URL you are visiting.

Also the other side of the coin is that you make it harder for visitors 
to your gemini page to make their own decision how to open the URL. Some 
users will prefer to launch the system browser, others will use a client 
that could render the web page directly, and yet others still will use a 
scheme proxy. By wiring up the web link yourself, you constrain the end 
user to control that aspect of the experience themselves.

Another, perhaps better fix, might be to update the client so it can use 
a scheme specific proxy like Duckling (HTTP) or Agena (Gopher) and share 
the update. There are a few that support this intrinsic gemini concept 
(GemiNaut, Amfora, Lagrange, AV-98, Diohsc off the top of my head).

But each to their own!

  Yes.  I generally use the Mozz web proxy:

	https://portal.mozz.us/

  I do have a simple client I wrote but it's generally used more for testing
than for actual browsing (it being not much more than the Gemini equivalent
of wget or curl).

That's what the Mansfield client does (minus a native GUI, since it's a
text UI) - it's meant to be the quickest path to an account on a gemini
server.

After downloading the client (builds are available for Windows, Mac, and
Linux), you can just press Ctrl-N and it will automatically do everything
for you.

Your account is based on whatever cert is active when you request an
account. The client will make a new random one the first time you run it
(with the common name of 'default'). There are shortcut keys in the client
to manage the client's certs - with an option to create a new cert using a
common name provided by the user.

Editing text/gemini docs from a created account is done *in the Mansfield
client* by design. We feel users shouldn't have to know anything about SSH
to contribute content to geminispace. All of this works with the gemini
server at ondollo.com by default.

https://ondollo.com/mansfield

We're super excited at the possibilities that exist when content creation
moves in the direction of "as simple as it can be". Gemini and cert-based
accounts feel like a great start.

I am a total newbie here, looking to help people migrate from the mainline social media to something more like the Internet of the '90s.  I don't know how folks on this list feel about gemlog.blue as a gateway drug, but signup and posting are about as simple as it gets, and you can post a proxy http link to your blog on any medium, or in email. Sooner or later the standard browsers will recognize the protocol and invoke a proxy, as some already do with ipfs.

Since there is no shortage of new Gemini capsules published every day, I'd like to announce my newest release:

A Gemini paste service:

gemini://paste.gemigrep.com

Just paste a piece of text or code and you'll get Gemini and HTTPs share links.

I hope that this service s useful to some of you. Have fun!

For the less command-line savvy people here, how exactly do we do this
using the commandline? or is it intended to be used using the gemini
interface?

You can use any Gemini browser for that, 

i.e. Lagrange:
https://share.getcloudapp.com/yAu6ZN8E

or Amfora interactively:
https://share.getcloudapp.com/z8uP4j54

or pass the paste directly to amfora:
$ amfora "gemini://paste.gemigrep.com/paste?This is another way to do it"

This will instantly create a new paste and give you the URL.

Is that what you mean?

Revisiting this issue, I want to clarify what my position was and is.

Bogan's case is that you don't want to be doing a bunch of 301s&31s from
unslashed to slashed all day every day.

I agree with that, and my site was definitely borked (both on HTTPS and
Gemini) for being set up to do just that.

Bogan's solution is that you add slashes to links.

I am not onboard with that solution but have now found another solution.
Instead of 301/31, the unslashed versions will now serve the text
directly.

This is what I intended all along, I just could not figure out how to do
it properly because I am secretly really bad at computers^W being
motivated to hack on server stuff.

In the future I might add 301/31 from slashed to unslashed, since that's
the canonical version. That's a project for another day though.

Thanks to everyone for their patience with how messed up my capsule has
been.

Please correct me if I'm wrong.

I believe that the original intent behind discouraging silent redirects 
was to avoid dark patterns such as tracking re-directs and short URLs 
made with the intent to hide the target (popular for Rickrolling and 
shock content).

If my above understanding is correct, then adding a trailing slash 
shouldn't be problematic. This should be clarified in the documentation.

That could still be a hidden infinite redirect (from unslashed to
slashed to unslashed to slashed to unslashed to slashed to unslashed to
slashed to etc).

IDK, I feel both bad at having my capsule messed up for so long and also
happy that I finally sorted it out.

Now unslashed links work as they should i.e.
gemini://idiomdrottning.org/texts gives you some texts instead of a 31
response.

I'm interested to hear how you all are updating your capsules. I'm just building out my infrastructure, and I've decided to use Docker for my gemini server (agate) and for my proxy (kineto).

For now, my index.gmi is in the gemini server's docker container. This isn't ideal, of course, since I have to rebuild the container every time I want to update the site, but it's fine for the moment.

Those who have regularly updated pages, though: how do you update them? I've been thinking I'll just use GitHub to store the capsule root, and reference that from the gemini server, but is there a smarter way?

Proper clients will perform an automated redirect no more than five
times. Even if the server is misconfigured and perpetually sends 3x
responses (from an unslashed URL to a slashed URL and vice versa), I
doubt it would lead to an infinite redirect in practice.

I've written a little bit about how my capsule is put together but
the basic overview is this.  Molly Brown runs in a container that has
read-only bind mounts to the document root and the bare git repository.
The former is updated by a git post-receive hook running on the server
that hosts the filesystem, the latter is the actual repository so that
one can browse it via the git.gmi cgi.

Off the top of my head, you could have your container's entry point do
a git clone of your github repository into your in-container document
root and just restart the container every time you want an update.

  There's a semantic difference between a URL that ends with a '/' and one
that doesn't.  The one that ends with a '/' is semantically a directory, and
to have to add a file per directory to get all URLs to end with a '/' is, in
my opinion, silly.  I can see what you are trying to do---skip the silly
".gmi" or ".gemini" extension as being part of the URL, but there should be
better ways of doing that that populating a filesystem with a bunch of
directories containing a single file (I may do a proof-of-concept with
extensionless files---no, wait!  I alreay have that---the individual tests
under the Gemini Client Torture Test!)

  Furthermore, if you follow this link, sans a trailing '/':

	gemini://gemini.conman.org/test/UCSD-Pascal-source.zip

you'll get a ZIP file.  But, add a trailing '/' to that:

	gemini://gemini.conman.org/test/UCSD-Pascal-source.zip/

and see what you get (hint:  it's not a ZIP file)

  Um ... just add a file to a directory?

  Oh, and for my blog, I send email to an account on my server, which then
adds the entry to the blog and generates the various feed files and index
pages for the web, gopher and Gemini.

Hi! I plan on downloading it and checking it out when I have more time.
Is there source available? If not, is there documentation, at the level

Hi!

I think updating a capsule is one thing that
can be easily over-engineered and you end up with 
a hell of dependencies and bucket chains (not sure
of this analogy is used in english tough).

KISS!

My source is in a git repo.
Sync to the root folder is done with a shell alias.
Done.

I have two capsules, one is generated using a custom clojure script
(that generates also the web pages for the WWW version of the site),
while the other is plain text/gemini file.  For both, I use rsync.

In particular, I'm running my server (gmid) inside a FreeBSD jail and I
mount the directory that contains the capsules using mount_nullfs (sort
of mount --bind) in read-only mode, so the server can read the file but
not edit them.

In your case, I think you can do something very similar with a shared
volume mounted inside the container to avoid rebuilding the image at
every update.  Then you can store your file in a git repo (and using a
post-receive hook to update the site) or rync or ...

I push it up with scp. The original files are hold on my notebook which 
is synced with syncthing to a Raspberry Pi every now and then for 
backup. Actually, I don't feel like I would need version management.

On the server side gmid (from Omar Polo) is running. One executable, one 
/etc/gmid.conf file, certificate, key and content under /srv/gemini/ - 
that's it.

Additionally I will install a very small webserver to serve the html 
automatically generated from my gmi files. More about this in my next mail.

I built a converter tool chain for Gemini files to html. Whole directory 
trees can be converted to html and then be served by a normal http server.

95% of the awk code had been programmed by Omar Polo and some snippets 
had been included from dracometallium's gmi2html.awk, especially the 
html header stuff and the correct conversion of linked .gmi-files. See 
more in my posts.

enteka  (just an alias for ssh myserver)
diario (another alias that cd's to the main content directory)
cp lastpost.gemini  newpost.gemini (lastpost and newpost are just placeholder)
vim newpost.gemini (and edit what I need to edit)
gemini (yet another alias for the home directory of my capsule)
vim index.gemini (add a new line for the new post, update the updated line)
```

And that's mostly it, really, fwiw. It's not perfect by any means but it works for my small gemlog, meaning I can update it daily with few overhead.

Keep the good work,
~ Miguel (Enteka)

Hey all,

It works very nicely, however, let me suggest a use case for it:
linking to medium content through a gemini a capsule.

That use case could benefit, if you made, the url structure more
"visible" so I can link to the content from my capsule with no
thinking and probably less errors

I mean something like:

=> gemini://b10m.net/cgi-bin/medium?https:%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fthe-ascent%2F21-tiny-habits-to-improve-your-life-in-2021-without-much-effort-2ab56e680947  21 Tiny Habits to Improve Your Life in 2021 Effortlessly

(Just literally took the first thing I got in medium)

So if you could add a litle feature to your proxy so it provides
not only the original url but the "gemini url" too that could be
a massive help for those interesting on commenting medium content
on Gemini. (and with 100% less privacy issues for our friends!)

OK, so, I've never done this kind of thing before, just PHP'd websites or using sinatra (ruby) that would take care of the "small details" for you.

So I tried this on a space I have on the ctrl-c.club tilde

```
#!/usr/bin/ruby

p "20 SUCCESS\n\r" # also tried puts
puts "# Cgi is working"
puts "some text"
puts "=>gemini://enteka.xyz some link"
```

and it doesn't seem to work. Amphora, for one does not recognize it. I'm sure I'm doing thins wrong here

Could that work in principle? Could I have an issue with permissions?

Please help

I don't know how ctrl-c.club works, what server they use etc.  But this
(if it's not a copy-paste error) looks wrong.  Instead of "SUCCESS" you
should put a media type there, like text/gemini.  Also, the \n and \r
are in the wrong order, \r comes first.  (puts should add a \n by itself
at the end, so `puts "20 text/gemini\r"` should be enough).

Then make sure /usr/bin/ruby is the correct path for you ruby
interpreter (you can type `which ruby` to check, or use `/usr/bin/env
ruby` which is "portable enough" across various UNIXes).

In the end, make sure it has the executable bit set (i.e. `chmod +x
your-cgi-script`).  Different gemini servers MAY impose limits on where
you store your scripts (i.e. under /cgi-bin/ or similar).

If it's nothing in the above list, then it's something you should inform
ctrl-c.club about (maybe they don't allow scripts?)

Good suggestion!

I've added the gemini url at the bottom now too and stripped the
pointless bits, so the url becomes shorter.

E.g.:
  -----------
  Gemini URL:
  [1]  gemini://b10m.net/cgi-bin/medium?/the-ascent/2ab56e680947
  HTTPS URL:
  [2]  https://medium.com/the-ascent/21-tiny-habits-to-improve-your-life-in-2021-without-much-effort-2ab56e680947

This has long since become a "how to do publishing" thread, so I'll throw my 2c in.

I use a make-oriented workflow that calls my fork of kiln[1] to generate both a templated gemini site and an html site. Further, my makefile has targets for "publish" (which just rsyncs up the files from wherever I am to my VPS) and "commit" and "push" which are pre-requisites for my "publish" target so that I don't get my git repo out of sync from my published site. Nothing fancy but available at [2].

Also I suppose that this may serve as an introduction to the list, as this is my first message. My capsule is at [3] and I'll let it do all the introductions for me. Please excuse the broken link; The dust is still settling - I should have that fixed by end of day today (a loving 1.5 year old son and wife make my personal time limited). I'm loving gemini so far. I actually *want* to create content for it, which is novel for me.

Also note that `p` is used for debugging (IIRC; I don't know ruby
often). You probably want `print` (or `puts`, to add a newline
automatically).

So either:

puts "20 text/gemini\r\n"

or:

print "20 text/gemini\r\n\n"

This kind of bridge raises a few questions

- medium.com texts are not under open licence so you can't redistribute
   it over a bridge that will strip most of it (ads included)
- the author may have wanted some specific layout/markup that you won't
   be able to render
- the authors / medium.com publishers are not aware that their content
   is available outside of medium.com

It may not seem harmful but I think it is wrong to proceed like this.

It works for something like wikipedia because the texts ARE licensed
with a compatible license for this kind of bridges.

I think it's a very fun idea, given that Medium is known for using
multiple megabytes of JS and CSS to render a page of plain text. That
said, I'm afraid what Sol?ne has to say about licenses is probably
correct.

In this example, the gemini capsule files are kept in a usb drive 
(USDBDRIVE), in the /media/username/USBDRIVE/Documents/gemini/directory 
on a local linux device.? The command is entered into a terminal on the

I agree to Sol?ne, this can get you in real trouble. You're basically stealing, modifing and redistributing their content. Of course there is no commercial gain for you, but you are break their copyright license.

I think Gemini should be known for genuine content and services, not stripped-down copies and bridges from the http world.

I disagree. We're not re-hosting their content on gemini, we're just 
using gemini as an interface to view it. Viewing medium in a web browser 
is a painfully slow experience, we are simply creating a better viewing 
experience for ourselves.
Would you use the same argument against, eg. A mobile twitter client? 
Twitter posts also aren't an open license. Just my 2 cents.

Although this argument has merits ("this is like viewing Medium with
the lynx Web browser, which is certainly legal"), I seriously doubt
that the legal system would agree. The big difference with a
stripped-down Web client is that you relay it to other people. IANAL
but I'm with Sol?ne that b10m is on a very dangerous field. (Not on
the short term, since Gemini is certainly not on the radar of lawyers,
but later.)

This thread touches an important topic, which I've been wondering myself
for a while now. Regarding your particular question, I think that every
website that exposes a public API which allows access to their content
indirectly allows the user to redistribute their content. So, this is
not the same as scraping a website's HTML.

That being said, where do we draw the line between providing an
interface and simply copying/redistributing third-party content?

By reduction to absurdity, if we create a web browser that cannot render
some HTML tags used by ads or that does not interpret javascript, are we
also just copying/modifying content? In this case I don't think we are,
so it's not a simple matter.

On the other hand, there's also the more philosophical question which
has also been mentioned. Should Gemini care only about exclusive content
and services, or is it fine to get a lot of content from other
platforms?

Twitter offers an API for those clients as far as I know.

Twitter is pushing back extremely hard on alternative clients, claiming
that they cause "consumer confusion", and they may end up becoming extinct.
Medium has blocked access to its API altogether, although existing API
users are grandfathered in.  Neither site allows screen scraping.

This content might be a nice-to-have on Gemini, but the downside is
extremely high: in the U.S., the penalty for willful copyright infringement
can be as high as $150,000 *per document*, plus court fees and legal
costs.

When I worked at Reuters, this was an excellent way of getting new
customers: google for a sentence from one of our published articles, see
which if any were on unlicensed sites, and contact the site owners.  It was
a lot cheaper for them to license the content than to pay those damages.
(In fact, almost all of the companies said that they did not know the
content had to be licensed, and they would much rather license it than stop
hosting it.)

I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice.

Just a bit of trivia, but the -a option includes -r normally so you 
could use -zaP. Instead of -P I usually use --in-place, but that's 
harder to type and I guess the end result is mostly the same.

Really great responses, thanks all!

The docker container I'm running is the reason I haven't simply been running with scp, but the volume mount idea is good, especially if I combine that with a git webhook.

In any case, I'll be sure to write up what I do (on gemini naturally).

Hello, everyone. I am new to this community and I intend to run my capsule in a kubernetes cluster on my existing rpi4 infra. As part of the CI/CD process for my production launch, I need a mechanism (like git) for source code control.

Before I recreate the wheel, does such a thing exist already?

Yes. That's why I removed the slashes and why I all along wanted the
slashes gone.

It seems like you've got what I want to do somewhat backwards.

You seem to think that I want URLs that end with slashes, i.e. has
directory semantics.
That's what I don't want.
That's why my internal links all along have been without slashes.
That's why I finally fixed the long-standing 31 issue.

And I needed to do programming to do so which is what I didn't wanna do
in the first place. Ugh. You guys roped me in to doing actual work.

The server-side technical implementation behind serving up, for example,
"The Dumbphone Experience" text at
gemini://idiomdrottning.org/dumbphone-experience

should not matter for users.

As far as they're concerned, that's a leaf node named
dumbphone-experience placed in the capsule root.

That's the semantics I want and that's the semantics I've got now. Jolly
good.

(On the server side, I could implement that in a couple of ways; I need
the server to be able to distinguish the page from other files (for
example I also host images, and plain text files) so on the server side,
I need to set up a naming scheme like dumbphone-experience.gmi,
dumbphone-experience.gemini, or dumbphone-experience/index.gmi and then
use server rewriting to serve up the correct node.

It's wholly irrelevant on the client side which of those three is in use
(I'm not mixing the three models, I use one of them). They get a file
named dumbphone-experience with the text/gemini MIME type which is what
they wanted.

Turns out that in order to get different languages for different
pages?which was the first thing I wanted to do on this list back in
August 2020?and this particular server, it's easier to use
dumbphone-experience/index.gmi because then I can also put metadata in
the same directory. Since I needed to reprogram the server anyway, I
could've come up with some cockamamie convention to get per-file
metadata, like dumbphone-experience.gemini and
dumbphone-experience.metadata both in the same folder and then serve
that as dumbphone-experience. Or have preambles that the server strips.
I coulda done it in all tons of ways. Does not matter to clientside
which way I did it.)

You posted the same argument in the same kinda patronizing way last

Semantics is my jam.

But he is wrong about this.

They work correctly when there is a consistent view which tree nodes are
leaf nodes.

Which is fine. It's just that foo is a leaf node. That's what I want.
The semantics work, it's just one level up.

True, relative links don't work when you have slashed and unslashed both
working. Because they'll be at different "levels" in the tree. So before
I add any relative links to my pages, I'll need to put in the 31s from
slashed to unslashed (which is the direction they should've been going
all along) so there's only one canonical URL for each page.

Please don't get me wrong. I think every effort to make the Gemini ecosystem richer is good.

The advice we give is more about the dangers of bridging a commercial content publisher like medium.com. Bridging and redistributing content in a modified form without consent (which happens here) breaks not only the Usage Terms of medium.com but infringes copyright of the author on the other side. Because the author published on medium.com and not on a gemini proxy under the domain b10m.net. That is a big difference in my opinion.

With your argument, Nico, I could build a streaming proxy to Netflix, re-encode the video stream to a smaller size and in black and white colours and offer the content to anybody using a different protocol than HTTP. I'm very sure it wouldn't take long for a Netflix lawyer to write me a letter.

With my capsule, gemini.tunerapp.org, I also redistribute content from radio-browser.info, but their data is licensed under public domain and the software is GPL. Just because Gemini is a grassroots community project doesn't mean that it is legal to ignore other's terms, licenses and copyright.

This is what I wrote back then:

Your own suggestion in that same thread had been that I should add a
custom Lua program.

I replied:
> I don't mind writing some Lua, Go, CL or any other language but that
> kinda fiddling will have to go on the back burner for now.

Every suggestion to "How do I set different langs for different gmi
files" was that I had to do programming.

And that's what I ended up having to do now. Even with Molly I ended up
having to program, eventually, because of this 31 slash issue.

I originally had URLs like gemini://idiomdrottning.org/texts.gmi and
gemini://idiomdrottning.org/images.gmi (those URLs will continue to get
updates for ever, don't worry Spacewalk fans).

Sure, extensionless would've looked nicer, but I don't wanna jump
through hoops just to get rid of four characters for vanity.

I had to put them in separate directories because of the languages. (Or
I would've? had to use GLV-1.12556 ?.)

And the semantics of slashed URLs is that people are requesting a file
named "" and that's dorky enough that I'll walk through the fire and the
flames to fix. Can't have that.

Thanks for creating this great project, I really like it.
Apart from the Copyright thing (it sucks) I think this project is
really cool. If you are willing to share the source code, I would be
hosting one instance of this over Tor (As I do with other stuff).
I don't think there's a big difference between your platform and things
like, for example, Invidious, Nitter, Bibliogram or even Drew Devaults
HackerNews script. It simply makes reading *a lot* more pleasant.
I really like reading in my Gemini client and it sucks that so much
content is only published on Medium. 
I say take back the web. Copying culture is part of it. The thing you
do absolutely is in the spirit of the early web, including free
availability of information, to everyone.

People on mobile, with data caps, in rural regions of the US (or
Germany for that matter, or quite a lot of other countries) also have a
right to access this content, in my opinion. Your project is *great*
for that.

I think this would be a lot less legally dicey if it were something you could run on your own LAN, akin to a caching proxy like Squid.  Offload the HTTP mangling and content scraping to a dedicated system and point your Gemini clients at it.

Indeed, we just had a helpful thread on this, and here's what I implemented a moment ago on my capsule - it's simple:

- Gemini server (agate, in my case) running in Docker
- Static mount in the container at run-time to /var/capsule on my host, which is actually a cloned git repo folder.
- Cronjob on the host to pull the main branch every five minutes or whatever to keep the /var/capsule directory up to date.

You can use post receive hooks too, that would be basically the same.

it - I am free to access all areas on the site and receive a certificate
challenge to the one directory as configured.

The problem I'm having is understanding how to add a specific client
fingerprint to the "allowed" list in the config file. The Molly Brown
documentation specify an allowed value takes the format of "hex-encoded
SHA256 fingerprints of client certificates". I have what I think is a valid
fingerprint that I then converted into hex added to this section (which is
significantly longer than any of the examples provided), but the
corresponding certificate is rejected when provided.

I am certain this is user error. I have very little knowledge on how to
manage certificates and rely on google searches when generated the correct
ones for this server. Assuming the values provided in the example config
file are based on real, working values, my value is nearly 4 times as long.

Here's what I did:
1. Generate a new key with following command:

> openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -out
> cert.crt -keyout key.key
>
2. Changed extension on output keys to .pem as required by Kristall Browser
3. Imported ley and cer into Kristall
4. Converted the fingerprint of the cert into hexadecimal with the
following command:

> echo -n "[Fingerprint went here]" | od -A n -t x1
>
> 5. Copied hexadecimal value into Molly Brown configuration file so the section looks like this:

[CertificateZones]

"^/foo/" = [

I went full hog, not going to lie here,?OH.MG is comprised of four servers and three DreamObjects buckets for data storage, three of the servers are self-hosted on-site in Paris, France and the fourth (for now) is a DreamCompute Instance that pushes updates to the DreamObjects buckets.

I have the production VM at DreamHost, the buckets for Gemini, WWW (+Assets), and Gopher (also at DreamHost), and then the individual servers within my network.

My on-site servers have the DreamObjects buckets mounted as drives (/var/www/html, /var/gopher, and wherever I put my Gemini root), for the moment the cache time is about 5 minutes but I might increase that as you get a lag on the first call if the file hasn't been accessed in a while.

And the prod VM is pretty basic, I use kiln to generate the site contents, then a deploy script that syncs the buckets, and sets the upload to the mirror hosts.

I ramble on a bit here : gemini://oh.mg/project/ <https://oh.mg/project/> or https://oh.mg/project/ <https://oh.mg/project/>

I basically went OTT to see if I could actually make it work and mainly cos I've been burnt a couple of times by self-hosted VMs dying and taking the content with them (and no backups, because YOLO apparently).

[...]

even more low-level approach:

gemigrep.sh:
```
#!/bin/sh
echo "gemini://paste.gemigrep.com/$(echo "gemini://paste.gemigrep.com/paste?$1" \
	| openssl s_client -quiet -connect paste.gemigrep.com:1965 2>&1 | tail -1 | cut -d / -f 3)"
```

Tested on OpenBSD's ksh(1).

Limitations:
- can't deal with newlines. You can insert '%0A' in the string to force a newline.
- I haven't figured out how to simplify this even more to set an alias... :/

(Replying to this message since I didn't get the parent email for some 
reason)

My static {Web,Gemini}site gets built in CI using Hugo. When the build 
is finished, the resulting files get sent over to my VPS using rsync + 
ssh. Both my website and Gemini sites are just directories with files, 
served statically.

I don't need containers or anything of the sort since my Gemini servers 
(agate or gmnisrv, depending on my mood) are both statically-linked 
binaries with no run-time deps besides certs. I also don't need to 
"store" pages in any particular fashion since I can re-generate them at 
any time by running "make" or "hugo".

I try to keep my setup as distro-neutral as possible; I shouldn't have 
to make any major changes whether my server is running Debian, Fedora, 
or Alpine.

Hello,

Section 5.4.2 of the Gemini spec states:

 > clients MUST NOT automatically make any network connections as part of
 > displaying links whose scheme corresponds to a network protocol

So Gemini clients can display things however they want, but you can't make a 
compliant client that automatically loads images.

In the same window? Sure! Just not automatically. The Lagrange client already 
does this with audio and images. If you click a link that leads to one of those 
file types, it will open a player or image viewer inline with the document.

Hope this answers your question.

adding the rest of that paragraph:

This reads to me as though automatically displaying links _without_ a network
protol (e.g. gemini://, gopher://, https://, etc.) would be okay. That sounds
like it applies to relative links pointing to a resource on the same domain
with the same protocol.

This may be your personal opinion but it is not legal advice. This
redistribution is certainly illegal in most legal systems.

The big issue is not when you render things in your own way (using
lynx or Dillo is legal) but when you provide access to others.

Indeed, there is no difference. I guess that Invidious or Nitter
authors rely on the hope that Google or Twitter would not want to look
as the bad guy by suing them. And that the use of these services is
limited enough not to threaten YouTube or Twitter. But they are at the
mercy of a change of opinion from Google or Twitter and any service
running these programs could be shut down very fast.

With that being said, I am running a scraper for the Nim forum that allows its content to be displayed on Gemini in gemtext. Its still kinda buggy but in most cases it works just fine.

Gemini is a toy protocol. There are two things nerds do with toy protocols: port them to ever smaller hardware, and perform a reductio ad absurdam of overengineering a deployment. Gemini on Kubernetes (and Kubernetes on Raspberry Pis in general!) is a joke, in the fine tradition of Enterprise Grade Fizzbuzz.

Personally, I can't wait for some crazy bastard to write a Gemini server in Motorola 68000 assembly for the Amiga.

Yes, just my layman opinion, however I meant the redistribution
conforming to the API terms. For instance, Twitter provides an API for
developers to create third-party clients. In my opinion a client that
you download from an app store, using such API, isn't breaking the law
by showing unaltered tweets. Or otherwise what's the use of such APIs?

Now, like I've also said in my original message, this is to be
contrasted with simply scraping a website's HTML where there's not a
public API to extract info. In this case it seems clearer to me that
content isn't meant for redistribution.

However, I honestly have no legal background at all, and I'm just trying
to figure out myself what can or cannot constitute infringement. I think
this is an important topic and hopefully we can learn from each other's
more or less educated guesses.

Announcing gredig, a collaborative language learning exercise.
=> gemini://gemini.thegonz.net/gredig/v

It's a simple CGI-based system I hacked together yesterday, running on 
Molly Brown. The idea is to exploit gemini's international and 
altruistic userbase, and its incorporation of utf8, to help us share our 
linguistic expertise.

You submit a sentence in a language you're trying to learn, then someone 
else expert in the language rewrites it, and you learn by comparing the 
two. Everything is fully pseudonymous, based on client certificate 
hashes.

I'd be interested to hear what people make of the interface, and how 
well it works in various clients.

For now at least it's all quite minimalist -- in particular there's no 
system to deal with abuse or free-riding. That could be added if it 
proves necessary, but I'm guessing it won't.

Maybe some of the legal issues could be mitigated if this was an app
like YouTube-DL rather than a web service. A local web server or even
just generating the gmi files.

Uh, this is legally not legal advice. Just thinking out loud. But that
way you wouldn't be redistributing the texts yourself.

This is exactly the reason I chose this project :) Gemini is simple, small-scale. K8s is unfathomable enterprise-scale. I have a 'personal cloud' at home - 4 RPis running clusters of DNS, DHCP, SMTP, and now Gemini.

If anyone is interested, it's open source (but WIP): https://github.com/sailboat-anon/mintranet/wiki/Features---Toolset

I'll be releasing the Docker buildfiles and source for my gemini server to this community in the coming days.

Subject: [Tech] Most popular Top-Level Domains
Message-ID: <20210214152055.GA16937@sources.org>

The Lupa crawler now displays most-popular TLD (Top-Level Domains) in
the geminispace by number of registered domains and no longer by
number of capsules
<gemini://gemini.bortzmeyer.org/software/lupa/stats.gmi>. This is
because popular hosting service using subdomains (like
flounder.online) tweak the statistics too much if you count capsules.

[The definition of "registered domains" is taken from Mozilla's Public
Suffix List <https://publicsuffix.org/>, which is not authoritative
but is better than nothing.]

With this, we have currently:

* com: 65 domains
* net: 42 domains
* org: 40 domains
* space: 25 domains
* xyz: 20 domains
* me: 13 domains
* club: 11 domains
* dev: 10 domains
* uk: 9 domains
* de: 9 domains
* eu: 8 domains
* ch: 7 domains
* info: 5 domains
* io: 5 domains
* moe: 4 domains
* tk: 4 domains
* site: 4 domains
* example: 4 domains
* se: 4 domains
* online: 4 domains

I suspect that many people choose a TLD for their capsule just because
it "looks cool" or because it is the cheapest at this time. But pay
attention, not all TLD have the same rules and when a dispute occurs,
the choice of TLD can be very important. The EFF (Electronic Frontier
Foundation) made a very good report about that "Which Internet
Registries Offer the Best Protection for Domain Owners?"
<https://www.eff.org/wp/which-internet-registries-offer-best-protection-domain-owners>. Read
it before choosing a name for your capsule!

You may think "OK, what's the problem if .me depends on montenegrin
law and .com on US law, I do not host political content, p0rn or file
sharing, so I risk nothing" but this is not true, any name can get you
the unwelcome attention of lawyers, for instance because they find
your name too close from their trademarks.

Much less than .space. Space is one of the TLD that accepted to remove
a name by simple request from MPAA (Hollywood lobby). No need for a
court order or even a private arbitrator.

Anyway, when you register a domain, you have to click a checkbox "I
have read the terms of use and I accept them". I'm sure everyone have
indeed read and understood the ToU :-}

There is a huge exception for EU nationals, pretty much all the registries are GDPR compliant right now (with the exception of .us obviously) when it comes to WHOIS suppression, but of course, that doesn't protect from some of the other shady practices.

With trademark disputes, you can be at the mercy of the local laws which could be quite lax or heavily in favour of the trademark holder no matter how ridiculous their claim may be.

There is, of course, geopolitical issues that can get your name cancelled, some ccTLD registries are run by foreign entities which could get you stuck in the middle of a ccTLD dispute, or the country can invoke local requirements at any time to favour their citizens.

I have a .sg domain and I'm hesitant to put much of anything on there because I've heard some stories of what happens when they just decide they don't like what you have to say.

Interesting. No mentioning of my .bio domain. I should definitely do some more digging here.
Anyway, thanks for the links you provided!

It's really fun, and a clever idea!  Thanks for making it.

The only complaints I can make are that the pseudonyms seems random
sequences of letters and that maybe it could be useful for a reviewer to
add a comment explaining why he/she re-pharesed the sentence in a
certain way.  Oh, and a link from the "sentence page" back to language
page (or to the "home" of the script cgi) would be handy :)

Cheers!

Hi dear Geminauts,

It's my first message on this mailing list so let me introduce myself. 
My name is Romain de Laage, I'm a young french student in Computer 
Sciences (excuse my english ;) ). I'm a free software, Linux, Raspberry 
Pi and Gnome lover. I discovered Gemini in December 2020. I think this 
protocol could be a solution to some of the HTTP problems so I'm very 
interesting in it.

I used to use Amfora as a Gemini Browser but it is not the most 
wonderful client to promote Gemini to no nerds people. Lagrange is a 
very awesome client but it is not well integrated in Gnome environment 
so I decided to try writing my own Gemini parser and viewer for gnome. 
Say welcome to Scorpius.

For the moment Scorpius can only take a file as argument or open a 
default file, parse and display it. It can't make a gemini request but 
all the text/gemini specification is implemented (I hope).

I will try to work more on this software, and maybe create another 
Gemini browser. You can find it here: 
https://git.rdelaage.ovh/rdelaage/scorpius.

I'm not a Gtk professional nor a Gemini professional but your comments 
are welcomed.

Hi,

I just released a new version of ncgopher, an ncurses based gemini
and gopher client.

Fetch the code at
  https://github.com/jansc/ncgopher

This is the biggest release so far including:

 - Full text/gemini support
 - Setting for automatic text wrapping of gemini content
 - Unknown success status codes are now handled gracefully, displaying any content
 - Manual and help pages are no longer fetched online for privacy reasons

See the github page for a complete changelog, list of bugfixes etc.
Most of the work for this release has been done by Johann150, it's great
to have an eager contributor to the project.

Give it a try, and don't hesitate to contact me for comments, questions
or feedback.


Cheers
Jans

Thanks, yes. I improved the pseudonym generation; now we have Tesikeso 
Bojiweto and Hegulobi Xedanelu. I also added a Conventions section to 
intro.gmi, recommending using square brackets [thusly] for comments.

>Oh, and a link from the "sentence page" back to language
>page (or to the "home" of the script cgi) would be handy :)

Hmm... I was hoping to avoid that, on the basis that navigation is 
something I would prefer to leave to the client. In a client with 
history and/or path-based navigation (an "up" command), it should be 
easy enough to get where you want to go. Or so I had hoped. I did just 
test in Lagrange, and found it a bit annoying since there's no up 
command, and requests returning 1* seem to get stored in the history, 
and to go back from one you first have to cancel the input prompt.

But I guess I consider this a client-side problem, so I'll leave it 
as-is for now. Feel free to try to convince me otherwise!

Lagrange has 'Go to parent' which should do this. ctrl-? or ?? should do it.

Hello

I saw the slides for the talk are up - no video yet. I look forward to 
that when it is up

I was a bit confused on slide 20 where you seem to be saying there are 
no hyperlinks in Gemtext

https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/retro_gemini/attachments/slides/4346/export/events/attachments/retro_gemini/slides/4346/retro_bortzmeyer_gemini.pdf#page=20

I could not understand how that can be correct? Gemtext *is* indeed a 
hypertext format with hyperlinks. A hypertext is merely any form of text 
and links forming a graph structure that allows users to navigate the links.

The only thing I thought was that you perhaps were referring to the fact 
that there aren't any within-paragraph markup.

Regards

 ?- Luke

It may seem like there is a "natural" difference between these two URL 
forms, but as far as I understand it the semantics of any URL path 
segment is opaque and determined by the server. The path is an opaque 
string whose semantics is not intrinsically discernable.

There may be no files or directories involved whatsoever. It happens 
that there is a simple sort of implementation to serve a folder of files 
in this way, but that is by no means a universal URL path semantics that 
we can make inferences about.

gemini://server/foo may or may not serve the same content as 
gemini://server/foo/ or it can redirect there. Either way it is up to 
the server to determine the semantics of the resource.

Clean and simple URLs are nice for end users, and maybe authors too. But 
that's the main reason we all strive for a simple URL structure.

After some additional reading and trial and error, I think I've made
progress, but still not successful.

I've now created a client key and a signed client certificate and added
them both to Kristall's certificate manager. I've also managed to generate
what I believe is a proper SHA256 has using this command on my client
certificate: openssl dgst -sha256

I believe this is a proper hash as it matches the style and length of the
examples proved in the molly.conf file. I've also verified that the
fingerprint of the key pair in Kristall matches the fingerprint of the
client certificate I used to generate the SHA256 hash.

The Certificate Zone area of the config file now looks something like this:

Now that I have a certificate value that looks to be correct, I'm not sure
what else to try. Are there any verbose logs available that I can enable to
see what is being passed to Molly Brown or how the certificates are being
compared?

AmiSSL[1] has full compatibility with the latest OpenSSL, requires 68020 or
higher and AmigaOS 3 or higher. The crypto itself would still take a long
time.

There also exist a unicode library called Ucode[2]. But since I discovered
it when writing this email, I don't know if it's usable for such a project.
Keeping up with the new Unicode versions is a project of itself.

While on the Amiga programming topic, I've been spending one or two hours
every Saturday evening (just a few weeks in a row) teaching myself Amiga E.

Inspired by Amiga E's 32 bit chars and AmiSSL for Amiga E[3], I've started
to write a gemtext parser (ASCII only at first, then Latin1 characters in
UTF-8) in the hope I can add enough features to eventually call it a gemini
client.

I wouldn't attempt doing it in M68k assembly, though.

You'd only need Ucode if you were writing a client; a server doesn't have
to display anything.  And Unicode only grows by adding new characters:
existing ones never get removed and most of their properties don't change
either, so keeping up actually isn't that hard.

I disagree. Gemini has links but not hyperlinks. This is why, for
instance, it is hard to translate automatically HTML (or any format
with hyperlinks) in gemtext; you are forced to postpone the links at
the end of the paragraph, thus losing context.

Many users would be surprised if we told them Gemini has hyperlinks,
when discovering how it works.

Message-ID: <d27a829a-158f-4623-baa6-ac7db620ce78@www.fastmail.com>

Everyone seems to agree that HTML is hypertext, but opinions are split, to say the least, about whether Gemini text is.

Is there a known word for Gemini text-style links?

Namely:

- Links must be on their own line (as opposed to inline in a paragraph)
- Links may have text associated with them (to tell the user what any given link is about)

I'd like to have a word to describe Gemini-text link style, if only to contrast it with good HTML linking style. In HTML, I can explain something inline with just an unobtrusive link, whereas in Gemini-style text I'd need to explain the reference beforehand (top of paragraph, top of section, top of page, what have you) or afterward (end of paragraph, end of section, end of page).

The definition of hypertext does not specifically mention that the
hyperlinks must be embedded multiple times within a line. It's perfectly
fine if you only define hyperlinks in new lines, which is the particular
case of Gemini.

Therefore, Gemini is hypertext.

Like I've said in a previous message recently, the definition of
hypertext/hyperlink seems to be extremely generic. I haven't seen any
constraints saying it must be possible for links to be embedded in-line
in paragraphs, nor have I seen anything that deems links on a newline by
themselves as non-hyperlinks. I really see the concept of hyperlinks as
something more abstract, presentation-neutral and representable by a
graph. It just happened that HTML and others allowed such embedding...

That being said, and getting back to your question, what if we just call
them links? The word link seems to be universally accepted as something
less restrictive than hyperlink. Perhaps there's no need to find a
specific word for Gemini?

There may be a range of valid and invalid opinions :) but Gemini forms a 
hypertext system.

We are so used to the most pervasive hypertext system - the web - with 
its fine grained inline markup, we may not realise that it is simply one 
of the forms hypertext can take.

Gopher is a hypertext system too.

>> Is there a known word for Gemini text-style links?

They are simply hyperlinks because Gemini is hypertext. We can call them 
links too as that is a common enough term.

As we know, Wikipedia has its issues, but its definition of hypertext is 
not bad

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext

Hypertext does have to be defined by a markup language, like the web or 
Gemini, but it is a good decentralised and scalable solution. Otherwise 
you need some sort of centralised system to define the hypertext graph - 
fine for small in-house hypertexts, but not scalable.

I use an oddball publishing scheme where my gemlog server understands
and reacts to changes to a bare git repository. So I make and commit my
changes and the git push over SSH to my server:
gemini://capsule.wetterberg.nu/2021/2021-01-07-gemlog-server.gmi

It relies on having a custom application running on your server, rather
than taking the static files + CGI approach with a generic gemini
server, so it's probably not everyones cup of tea :)

FWIW, big fan of Netlify? for such setup: automatically publish out of a github repository.

Oof - sorry for the typo - I meant to write "Hypertext does [not] have 
to be defined by ..."

I suppose one might quibble whether Gemtext is markup - I see it as a 
line based markup format since the line type "#, *, => " is embedded in 
the line itself. You can also think of it as a menu like Gophermap, 
although it's not such a strict menu type as a Gophermap, but you can 
see the provenance from that line of thinking.

Gemtext is the unexpected and surprisingly successful love child of 
Gophermaps and Markdown. We all hope to inherit the best attributes from 
each of our parents...

Up to now I just can't find this video. At FOSDEM they say:

"All talks have been recorded and they will be made available on 
video.fosdem.org/2021 as soon as the presenter reviews their talk."

Maybe this step is just missing? Or does anybody have a link?

FOSDEM is run by volunteers, they are probably still recover from the 
event. It can take several weeks until the videos appear. It is a lot of 
work.

I know at least one hypertext purist who would argue that the web isn't
hypertext either, because it doesn't meet many of the standards of
Project Xanadu. Web links aren't bi-directional, they can be broken, and
there's no transclusion.

I think we don't need to get hung up on whether Gemtext is hypertext.

Indeed, "hyperlink" is short for "hypertext link"; there were hypertexts
(in the sense of texts not necessarily to be read in a linear order) long
before there were links.  The Talmud, the book of Jewish law and culture,
is a hypertext, for example.  Each page consists of nine sections, laid out
in three columns plus margins.  In the top of the middle column is the
Mishna (1), typically a question with some basic possible answers, each
attributed to an early Jewish sage.  Below that is the Gemara (2), the
record of a centuries-long discussion and clarification of the Mishna.
Here's a fictional example:

*MISHNA:* WHEN DOES ONE RECITE *GOODNIGHT MOON*? UNTIL EIGHT. RABBI JUDAH
SAYS: UNTIL ONE HOUR BEFORE. RABBI GAMALIEL SAYS: UNTIL MIDNIGHT.

*GEMARA: *Until eight? What does that mean? Rav and Shmuel argued. Rav
said: Until eight in the evening, for it is as my father taught: ?No story
for you, young man, if you?re not in bed by bedtime.? Can it be that
bedtime is eight? Is it not written (Kohelet [Ecclesiastes], 7:30), ?of
making of bedtimes there is no end?? [The cases of ] Kings are different,
as it is written, ?And David addressed them, saying: ?You kids don?t know
how good you have it. If I wanted a bedtime psalm growing up, I had to
write it myself.?

Shmuel said, until eight means until eight years old. From where does he
get this? As it says in *The Little Midrash [Interpretation] Says What I
Want It To*, ?And Aaron said to Yochebed his mother, ?If I hear that stupid
story one more time I swear I?ll kill somebody. Mo is six?can?t he read it
to himself??? How does this teach us anything? Moses was six, and he wanted
the story read to him. Six, but not seven; and the Mishna which says until
eight, means up to but not including, so that we read to a seven-year-old
but not an eight-year-old. But maybe Moses was different? No, we learn the
law from Aaron, and we do not read aloud in the presence of
eight-year-olds, because of the prohibition of tempting minors to lose
their tempers.

Maybe Aaron was different, because he did all the talking and his brother
took all the credit? No, let us not say that, because it is said of Aaron
that he loved peace and chased peace and loved his brother and chased his
brother and only once was his brother rushed to the emergency room.

Rabbi Bluto ben Rav Popeye said, ?Once I visited the Academy in Pumpeditha.
The sages were debating the question of eight inclusively or eight
exclusively. For seven years they argued this point, and not once did they
arrive home from the Academy in time to put their children to bed.?

Abaye once told his mother: ?I do not want to go to bed. I will run away
and become a Torah scholar and hide in the study hall where you can?t find
me and they wouldn?t let you in even if you did.? Said his mother: ?If you
become a Torah scholar and hide in the study hall, then I will be the
vending machine that sells you Coca Cola so you can stay up all night
learning.? ?If you are going to dispense soda,? said Abaye, ?then I will by
all means become a Torah scholar.? And so he did.

Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said, ?Better to read two books by Dr. Seuss than to
read *Goodnight Moon* once.? It is from here we learn of the prohibition of
ktav isha (reading writings written by women).

Every night, Rabbi Bag Bag would recite before his son. His son would say:
?Read it again! Read it again! Read it again, Abba! [Father!]?


In the right column of the page is Rashi's commentary (3), the purpose of
which is to explain the plain meaning of Mishna and Gemara to students.
The left column (4), which extends across the bottom of the center and
right columns, contains commentaries from a variety of sources.  Squeezed
into the narrow space between the middle and right columns are any Biblical
cross-references (7).

The upper part of the right margin contains cross-references to similar
parts of the Talmud (5) near the top; more cross-references, short
definitions of hard words, emendations of errors, and references to modern
commentaries (8) are placed further down.  The upper part of the left
margin contains references to major Jewish legal codes compiled from the
Mishna and the Gemara (6), and the lower part (which extends across the
bottom margin) contains any additional commentaries (9).

You can see a single page at <
http://murals.wbtla.org/uploads/2/4/7/9/24790045/talmud_layout_(1).pdf>
with numbers on the sections.

There is no problem with storing links out-of-band rather than embedded in
a document.  As long as the links point in one direction only, this is
perfectly scalable.

I don't think so, though the wording is ambiguous.  I take it to refer to
both explicit and implicit schemes, but to allow automatic fetching of
file: links, about: links, and others that don't involve the Internet.

I'm not sure. For outreach, it is important. If we claim that Gemini
is hypertext, beginning authors of gemtexts will be disappointed when
they discover they cannot add a link on a word.

Yes the web has inevitably set a lot of cultural norms expectations (inline
markup, images, stylesheets, fonts etc) for online hypermedia that Gemini
has to push against when first encountered by new authors. It may turn some
off, but I hope enough will stay and come to appreciate the benefits as
well as the losses of the simplicity of its choices.

I plan to keep the redirects going for as long as possible, but ideally you

Happy new home!

A minor thing - your ascii art and first heading still say makeworld.gq 
- you might want to fix that some time.

Hi there

You need a list of gemini browsers to link to it for your new visitors, 
voila:

And I put the english version of my last blog article also on gemini, 
the fediverse for beginners:

For Gemini-style link markup I think "gemini link" (or "gemlink" for
short) makes sense.
A "Gemini link" doesn't exist, what you mean is Gemini-style link markup.

A hyperlink is a link between electronic documents, created via markup
of some form, being inline is entirely irrelevant to this matter, so
is having label text.

"link" as a word by itself is: "A unit in a connected series of units." :P
When using "link" in terms of e-documents (like I do in this email),
we mean a hyperlink.

Absolutely nothing wrong with calling them Gemini links :)

I was able to solve my problem, although I'm still not sure what the issue
was.

I stumbled across solderpunk's gemcert
<https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/gemcert> program for creating
certificates. His program provides server and client key pairs. As part of
the client key creation process, it automatically outputs a certificate
fingerprint with SHA256 encoding.

With this I did the following:
1. Reinstall server certificates issued by gemcert
2. Add client key and certificate to Kristall issued by gemcert
3. Added the hash provided by gemcert from creating client certificates to
the CertficiateZone are of the Molly Brown configuration file.
4. Restart Molly Brown

I can now browse the restricted area using the client certificate, but I'm
still not sure why this worked and creating one through OpenSSL did not
work. The only difference I could see is that gemcert creates ECDSA
certificates instead of the RSA ones I tried previously.

If anyone has any insights, I'd love to understand why this was successful.
Unfortunately the only thing I learned through all this is to use gemcert
for client certificates and I have no idea why.

Recently I found some people interested in Gemini as a research sharing format.  Their one requested extension was inline rendering of mathematical notation via Groff MS or TeX syntax.  Would this be something that could be handled as a special client side handler for links to documents containing the fragments, like how Lagrange handles inline image expansion on link select?  I do see the appeal, but I don't want to introduce the weight of Roff or MathML or TeX into the Gemtext format spec.

I don't see why you couldn't have a client that could expand rendered 
math notation. You could just store it in the gemtext as a plaintext 
block with some kind of header/alt text that the client could read.

My concern there is that the minute we encourage inline alternate markup some clown starts injecting full HTML5/CSS3 into Gemtext instead of as separate .html links.

One of the golden rules of Gemini is user control, and by *default*
this would be off.
MathML/similar via preformatted blocks would be fine IMO, *if the user
enabled it*.

I don't see anyone ever making clients that render HTML as, well, why
would they?
But I understand that concern.

The spec never explicitly disallows this, but it does say how
preformatted lines should be displayed, which ~kinda disallows it.

IMO this specific case of MathML/similar would be perfectly fine.

I don't think it would be a good idea to embed Tex inline in gemini.
Some people can not read Tex and if their client didn't support it,
they would see weird characters. One of the ideas behind gemini I like
is that even plain text gemtext without any rendering is readable.

I would propose a bit different strategy, link a .tex file and have a
special client that can render it inline after clicking on the link
similar to how lagrange renders images.

This way is much more universal, we don't have to extend gemtext for
every use case, we can use existing formats.

Could it simply be serving a TeX file as application/x-latex (or another mime type) and let the client/user open it with any suitable app?

I agree completely.  I do use LaTeX and related, and I do see the appeal
of inlining it, but keeping gemtext simple forever is more important.  I
can imagine someone designing a renderer (which could use e.g. MathJax
or even just run it through LaTeX) or even a full-blown client for this.
It's also imaginable that some clients in the future support dynamic
(.dll / .so style) libraries which can render inline certain links, but
that's not happened yet (and I think there'd be a debate here on the ML
first).

I don't wanna disagree with someone who is in my own corner on this?,
but?

It's tree semantics, which is evidenced in practice by the way relative
links work. (Especially since .. and co exist).

A link to bar/baz from gemini://server/foo leads to
gemini://server/bar/baz while a link to bar/baz from
gemini://server/foo/ leads to gemini://server/foo/bar/baz.

I've now implemented 31s and 301s from the slashed to unslashed so now I
can start using relative links again. Except they'll have to be written
to reflect the reality that /foo is a leaf node and not a directory
node, i.e. the leaf node is no longer a file named "" (the empty
string).

It's also something that might be good to reflect in culture and
convention.

I could see if, for example "gemini://medusae.space/index.gmi?20",
instead had the url been gemini://medusae.space/home/cooking/index.gmi,
how that would make sense in some way.

I've kept my own web page & capsule having all flat URLs in one huge
name space for a while. It's a tradeoff?

I just watched the video and I think it is excellent piece of outreach - 
thanks for making that Stephane.

It would be a good item for a general Gemini public page for the 
gem-curious who drive by.

It is a shame the Q&A at the end aren't recorded - I wonder what sort of 
questions came from the floor...

You end with the question: Is Gemini too brutalist? Probably yes for 
some it will be on first contact. But it will return to them some time 
in the future as they are clicking through the popups, cookie acceptance 
panels, autostarting videos, and strangely familiar adverts.

Its an interesting topic - and I'm sure there is a lot of prior thought 
on this we get to rehash for fun here.

Yes I do agree the relative link resolving semantics are tree-like, but 
that's all, and its not much. Relative path creation is a server side 
act so the URL semantics is still determined by the server/content author.

I was thinking more in terms of the content or URL semantics as in what 
is the expected meaning of the "parent" fragment in respect of the "child"

The content semantics may not be tree like in the pleasant way we see 
when serving a file system file and folder structure.

/foo/ may not be any kind of meaningful container of /foo/bar and 
foo/baz - we can't assume it is the more generic location.

We may imagine a perfectly valid URL /westminster/london/uk - that might 
make sense for a certain type of application. It is sort of upside down 
from a classical geographic point of view, so the domain semantics may 
not map onto the url fragmentation. That is sort of what I had in mind, 
that we cannot infer much about the domain semantics from the url structure.

Similarly an opaque URL /dhjksfl/sueyug/sodfye - its only tree like in 
respect of relative path resolution. The domain semantics of the path 
fragments in this case are almost completely opaque. /foo/bar/baz may 
seem to have more semantics, but it has the same behaviour. Hence I do 
think this is in the realm of pragmatics of use and conventions.

We like to look at a URL and hope it is more sensible - and some clients 
implement an "up" feature to go up the path. But what you get in general 
as you do so is anyone's guess. But day to day conventions and 
pragmatics usually are strong enough that this sort of thing usually works.

Subject: Math Notation in Gemini?
Message-ID: <MTh4z5Y--3-2@nnix.com>

I second this. Serving the file as an appropriate type and letting the client decide is absolutely the approach. Rendering TeX in-line will mess up the readability of the plaintext for those rendering plain, not to mention open doors to further debasement of the standard.

The appeal of TeX integration is obvious, I use nothing else for document creation myself, but one person's TeX convenience is another person's tracking-cookie circus, so let's hold the line and stay focused! If we didn't allow in-line links and images, we're not to the point of even debating TeX.

I do see the appeal, but I don't want to introduce the weight of Roff or MathML or TeX into the Gemtext format spec.

Could it simply be serving a TeX file as application/x-latex (or another mime type) and let the client/user open it with any suitable app?

Right. And going to ../ontario or ../france or ../belgrade might be
legit links from the UK London to other Londons because it's a tree.
And ../../memphis/tennessee for another Westminster. Because it's a tree.

Maybe it's wrong to call it slashless and more correct to call it
dotless.

Links on gemini://some.url/foo/bar/baz will act as if the page
was gemini://some.url/foo/bar/baz.gmi rather than as if the page was
gemini://some.url/foo/bar/baz/_.gmi

I've now updated mdna to 31 slashed to slashless. Having both resolve to
the same page is what creates the ambiguity.

  Of the two clients I use (generally portal.mozz.us but sometimes the
simple one I wrote), this link causes them to fail:

	gemini://idiomdrottning.org/

  Namely because both these clients get a redirection to:

	gemini://idiomdrottning.org

but both clients will always send:

	gmeini://idiomdrottning.org/

(well, I can speak for my own client which does that, I suspect that's
what's happening for portal.mozz.us).  There's language in RFC-3986 about
this particular case (section 6.2.3).

I just pushed an update to the portal.mozz.us proxy to fix this.
Actually the code was already in place, but my web framework was doing
an automatic redirect on the missing slash to try to be helpful :/ The
following URL should now work without re-adding a trailing slash.

https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/idiomdrottning.org

Your point is well taken though. gemini://example.com and
gemini://example.com/ are canonically the same resource and should
always return the same response. It took me a while to understand this
but I now see the light.

Once we get a nice joingemini.org outreach Web page. (IMHO, it is very
important to have such a Web site, but not urgent since programs today

Many FOSDEM participants are privacy-conscious and do not want too much
recording: the speakers consented, not the participants. Said in an
other way: th Q&A is more free if it is not recorded.

Are you sure?

RFC 3986, section 6.2.3 says "In general, a URI that uses the generic
syntax for authority with an empty path should be normalized to a path
of "/"." Note the "in general". The rest of section 6.2.3 explains
that is is scheme-specific.

<gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.gmi> seems
silent about "gemini:" rules. 1.2 says "The path, query and fragment
components are allowed and have no special meanings beyond those
defined by the generic syntax."

(The Lupa crawler currently normalizes <gemini://example.com> to
<gemini://example.com/> but I wonder if I'm right.)

You cannot turn that into a "spy pixel" since there is no extra
network request.

PS: how many clients display that?

I'm in the camp that you should have whatever structure you like :)

On the web I prefer simple flat-ish URL structures, probably without 
even any file extension. A lot of URLs expose the innards of the site 
(cgi-bin, *.php) implementation that is orthogonal to the URL and 
content naming, and I put file extensions in that bracket. How many of 
our visitors need to know what some site is implemented in, or it it is 
a database, or built from a static site generator? That is what Apache 
mod_rewite was made for.

Personally I'm a bit more torn about this in Gemini, as the landscape is 
much more spartan.

Having a link end *.pdf gives readers a very good hint as to the content 
at the end of the URL and it helps me make a choice - do I want to click 
that thing or not? Also clients can provide certain UI hints or 
decorations to suggest the likely content of the link with some basic 
URL heuristics. So in Gemini, I prefer to see a file extension in the URL.

Similarly clients can implement a simple "Up" feature which means any 
page does not need this intrinsic navigation. All assuming the author 
maps their content onto the URL structure in a sensible way.

As a visitor, we cannot expect URLs to implement any sort of tree 
structure, but in practice they usually do and we can traverse up and 
down the URL architecture as well as by following the authored links. 
For me this is the pragmatics of URLs.

This is widely recognized as a very bad practice since, should you
change implementation (moving from PHP to Node?), the URL would
change, which is bad <https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI>

> Having a link end *.pdf gives readers a very good hint as to the

Sure, but this is a very different case. The extension is about the
content, not about how it was generated/served.

I agree that, for the visitor, it is better. I certainly prefer sites
where you visit <gemini://guide.example/france/paris> and can edit the
URL in the address bar to go to <gemini://guide.example/france/>,
expecting something more general about France.

As you know (but it may be worth repeating), RFC 3986 does not mandate
that this works. Paths are mostly opaque. You cannot rely on it, but I
find it cool, and a Good Practice.

To clarify - for linked resources in gemini (png/jpg/pdf/mp3 etc) - just 
show me the extension of every other type that is linked to. I can make 
a calculation whether to activate the target or not. Might it be large 
or slow, will it launch some other application etc.

For the primary nodes and default content type of the gemini hypertext 
(text/gemini) I just need the name of the thing, and I don't need to 
know how it was generated.

A "data:base64..." embedded image, if there is such a thing in Gemini, doesn't trigger a network request.

The above was to illustrate the use of redirects to uniquely tag URLs, without any use consent. 

Nothing to do with data: URI. 

Even though a data URI could contains resources which could trigger network activities.

I whipped up a quick script to allow browsing this mailing list within Gemini, as if it were a forum:

gemini://tobykurien.com/cgi-bin/mailing_list.py

This might also work as a kind of simple Gemini message board - post/reply via the mailing list, and browse the posts from Gemini.

Hm, I'm not a security or browser developer but do you have an example of a "data URI" that would trigger network activities in Gemini? I thought that Gemini spec was designed in a way to prevent that from happening.

Also: do you know any Gemini client that inlines images from non-local domains without explicit consent from the user? If so, we should open an issue because that is clearly against the spirit of Gemini. 

Regarding the request/response workflow you describe above: tracking happens already at the first request (and thanks to IPv6 every client has one or more unique IP addresses, and thanks to TLS every client has a unique signature in the request payload).

It would be excellent for gemini to render mathematical notation but as
was said such a requirement conflicts with the core concepts of the
project.
However, much of mathematical notation (a lot of diagrams (category theory), for example) can be reasonably well rendered as ASCII art.
The only problem is that it might be to tedious to manually set so I was
wondering - is there some TikZ-to-ASCII or at lease diagram-to-ASCII
script?

I do see the appeal, but I don't want to introduce the weight of Roff or MathML or TeX into the Gemtext format spec.

Previously on the mailing list someone mentioned aamath[a] to render
formulae:

A_OPR = x*sqrt(x^2-1)/2 - int(sqrt(t^2-1), t = 1 .. x)

will turn into:

                        x
            ______     /
           / 2        |    ______
       x \/ x  - 1    |   / 2
A    = ----------- -  | \/ t  - 1 dt
 OPR        2         |
                      |
                     /
                      1


For diagrams, I'm sure if you could convert it to dot language[b] (more
common than one might think, lots of software supports it) then it'd be
trivial to convert it to ascii, here's a utility I found after a quick
search: https://github.com/ggerganov/dot-to-ascii

Thank you! This seems to exactly what I was looking for.

That's an interesting point. Assuming the gemini spec is undefined
simply because this edge case was not considered at the time (that I
am 99.9% sure of). Can you make an argument for why this
normalization *should not* be adopted by gemini://?

The biggest advantage that I see is that we can use existing URL
normalization tools and libraries which, like it or not, are heavily
biased towards working with the http:// URL scheme.

Also, those URLs being the same means that I can always depend on
using "/" as the relative link for my root URL. If I had to worry
about them being semantically different, I would also want to be able
to use an empty string "" as a relative URL (which is valid as far as
I can tell, see path-empty in section 4.2 the RFC). But looking at the
text/gemini specification for link lines:

=>[<whitespace>]<URL>[<whitespace><USER-FRIENDLY LINK NAME>]

A blank, relative <URL> will collapse into

=>[<whitespace><USER-FRIENDLY LINK NAME>]

which collides with the alternate form of

=>[<whitespace>]<URL>

Hi all!

Is there a way to set up pages that are signed with Gnupg? To allow
basic clients to not see anything, the signature would be in a separate
file.

The purpose is to make pages downloadable along with their source code
and signature.

I think most people interested in seeing mathematical notation are going to want the real thing, rather than ASCII art reproductions.  Auto-generating ASCII art representations might be a fun challenge for a terminal client.

It's intended for use in some personal tools I'm writing, but I thought
I'd factor it out from the beginning, and maybe someone else would get
some use from it. It's not terribly mature; see the issues page for

I was having a terminal client in mind.
Of course, for the real thing the only reasonable option I see is just linking
to a pdf, i.e. mimic arXiv.

I think it is worthwhile to point out that this library has only 100 lines
of code + 19 lines of packaging information (which are also in fact code),
and only six dependencies: a general utility library (Alexandria), an
encoding-decoding library (Babel), a socket library that bridges the
differences between different Common Lisp implementations (Usocket), a
library for encoded streams (Flexi-stream), an SSL library (CL+SSL), and a
URI library (QUri), all of them bog-standard.

SVG images would work nicely in data: URIs.

They can have JavaScript in them.

If I were making a graphical Gemini browser, I?d just decode the base64 text and then hand the entire blob off to some SVG library, which, for all I know, might run the JavaScript.

Or it might not. I don?t remember seeing any SVG-decoding libraries that depended on Node.

Subject: Search forms and server side search scripting?
Message-ID: <5b23bd10-27ab-b11f-2169-31f25f314a41@gmx.com>

I've looked at the Gemini specification [1] and wonder where I can find
information about receiving search or other input from the client.
Perhaps I am missing something obvious, as I see that there are a
growing number of interesting, searchable capsules [2] but have not yet
seen how to do that.  My goal is to implement a local search function
for a capsule being built.

So I have two questions,

1) What markup should a gemini page contain to trigger an input dialog,
and where may I see some sample code or pseudo code for the server-side?
 If anyone has any sample- psuedo code to share, that would be wonderful.

2) Which servers are light yet can still handle referrals to scripts, or
is that best handled by a separate package and let the server deal with
static pages only?

Here's an example of a very basic CGI script written in Ruby:

  gemini://rwv.io/src/search

It triggers a "10" response when there's no query set, otherwise it
returns a "20" response with links to all the files matching the query.
In this case it simple greps through the gemini directory.

Note, it doesn't do query string decoding so, depending on the server,
you might have to do some for "special" characters.

Any light server supporting CGI should be fine.

Damn, just found that:

Didn't realize that SVGs are just part of the DOM and can contain and run arbitrary JavaScript. I was a huge fan of SVGs until now :-).

Thanks for bringing that up.

If the library does run the JS (or make external requests in another
form) and not have an option to disable it I would consider that a bug
myself.
Myself I would always use separate files for SVG and images.

I think for data: URIs clients shouldn't process ones that have the
possibility to make network requests without the user explicitly
saying yes to it.
The spec kinda falls apart here as data: isn't a network protocol :/
> clients MUST NOT automatically make any network connections as part of displaying links whose scheme corresponds to a network protocol

How would data: even work in gemini text anyway?
Link lines are only supposed to be for *URLs* not URIs

There is a formal profile for SVG-without-DOM-or-CSS-or-JS called "SVG
Tiny", which comes in 1.1 and 1.2 flavors (1.2 added a few features that
are still considered safe).  If you want your graphical Gemini browser to
render such images, outfit it with an SVG Tiny renderer.  I don't know of
any fully conformant SVG Tiny 1.2 renderer at the moment, but svgirl claims
to convert any conformant input to a list of lines and curves to draw,
which can then be passed to any graphics library for actual rendering.

Thank you for noticing!

Being a relative CL-newbie coming mostly from the Python world, I'm not as
dependency-averse as a lot of more experienced CL developers. But I did like
that not much was necessary.

The server https://tildegit.org/solene/vger is lightweight enough that you could probably run it on NetBSD/m68k.  For clients, I think you'd probably be better off writing one in the native UI APIs of whatever m68k system you're using.

Subject: [SPEC] Experimenting with a status code of 12
Message-ID: <CAFwUW91UjDz7tr8x7b+AcySRQ2ZF8dmRAL3q5PMNjwu8ZkMK+A@mail.gmail.com>

Good evening!

(I know this is a long email - I'm excited to share some of what I've been
experimenting with. Hopefully it's coherent.)

I've been experimenting with a non-standard status code and I wanted to
share some details. I am running this experiment to find a way for users to
manage content using only a Gemini client and server. No ssh, rsync, vim,
emacs, nano, or anything else.


# High Level Concepts

I see status code 10 as the server telling the client that the user can,
"provide short input".

I see status code 11 as the server telling the client that the user can,
"provide short secured input".

I've been using a status code of 12 for having the ondollo.com server tell
the Mansfield client that the user can, "provide long input".

The simplest conceptual adjustment is that there's no character limit on
the input a client might provide in request/response input cycle involving
a status code of 12. Status codes 10 and 11 have specified limits around 1k
bytes (I'm fudging the details there). Status codes 10 and 11 also have the
specified behavior of putting the user input into the URL as the value of
the query component. So... the simple part is that there's no limit to the
number of bytes sent from a client to a server in a request/response input
cycle involving a status code of 12.

To escape the 1k limits of the URL in responses to 10 and 11, my
exploration of status code 12 places the user input in the body. This meant
I had to change my server from only understanding how to process the single
request line of standard requests to processing the request line *and* the
body when it sees a response to a 12. So I needed to tell the difference
between requests with a body and ones without.


# Some of the Consequences of the Above Approach

Since I then needed to be able to tell the difference between requests that
didn't have a body and those that should, I modified the server to provide
unique links to the client. These unique links use a UUIDv4 that is tracked
on the server and expire after a day. These are, IMO, the
geminispace equivalent of server side sessions. I say the
geminispace equivalent since they do as little as possible and only for the
purpose of getting simple content from the writer to the reader. (The
current spec says as much and explains additional privacy benefits of this
concept of server-side sessions.) Because the goal is to help users manage
content (or resources) using only a Gemini client, internally the UUID is
paired with the clients certificate fingerprint and originally requested
resource. In practical details, the resource is the page the user is
editing.

So. If a client provides a certificate and a URL that contain the
fingerprint and UUID (respectively) that the server is tracking, the server
will accept the body of the request as the value of the originally
requested resource.

To make the impact of certificate fingerprints line up more with *all* of
the content a user might want to manage, the user must create an account on
the ondollo.com server first. This account creation process is very very
simple. The only step is to visit this link [1]:

=> gemini://ondollo.com/internal/account/create

The certificate used when visiting that url is the certificate required to
be provided when managing content in that account, since it's the
certificate that will be paired with the UUID and originally requested
resource on any resource that provides edit or create links. (This concept
is also explored a bit in the current spec, and mentioned that it could be
thought of as analogous to the .authorized_keys file on an SSH server.)

[1] - After creating an account you'll get a status code of 20 in response,
with unique links as described above - if you use those links you'll get a
status code of 12 containing the current value of the resource as the body
of the response and letting you manage your content as this email describes
(assuming your client supports sending requests with a body).


# Concerns About Certificates in Geminispace

This puts additional emphasis on the geminispace use of certificates. We
feel we've lined up with the current spec quite well on this. If a client
created content with a certificate and then lost the certificate, the
content would no longer be accessible for writing. If an account were
created with a certificate and then the user lost that certificate, the
account would no longer be accessible. If a client allowed more than one
certificate to be locked to ondollo.com, then the user could choose between
more than one account anytime they visited. If a user chose a certificate
that had never been registered with an ondollo.com account, the server
would have no way of knowing that that user might already have an account
under a different certificate.

There is an additional concern about 'leaking' the certificate. If a
certificate is used to create an account, it becomes a form of
username/password. If that same certificate were presented to other servers
as a user were browsing through geminispace, the other servers would have
access to any resources in that account that had been limited to only those
who can present the original certificate. (At least, I think that's true
from my limited understanding of certificates. I'd *love* to be proven
wrong on this.) IMO this means that Gemini Clients must allow and encourage
users to 'lock' certificates to specific sites (urls? hostnames? domains?).
(Here, again, the current gemini specification seems to agree and mentions
this as a concern that client implementers should watch for and enable
users to manage - by hostname+path, locking all urls with that pair as a
prefix.) The Mansfield client was modified in two ways to support the above.

The first was simple - allow a user to lock a certificate to a hostname.
Then, every time the client navigated anywhere, it would check the
lockfiles to see if the hostname it was about to open a connection to had
already been locked to a cert. If it had been locked to a cert, that cert
would be used for all communication with that hostname, including the
initial connection. (We're still on the fence about locking to the
hostname+path pair, but we lean on the side of considering it a
'good-thing' that we'll probably implement.)

The second adjustment to support user privacy is that the Mansfield client,
on start-up, generates an in-memory-only cert. This isn't secure memory, or
memory that can not be flushed to disk, this is just a certificate that
can't be reused after the client is shutdown. This is done so that if the
user navigates to any hostname that is *not* locked to any other
certificate, the in-memory cert created at startup will be used. This
removes the possibility of leaking a locked cert. We think that a
recommendation along the lines of generating an in-memory cert like this
might improve the current gemini spec.


# After-thoughts

One additional point - the account name used when following this cert-based
process is based on the subject-common-name element in the cert. To deal
with collisions, the first few characters from the certificate fingerprint
are combined with the above common-name. We plan to eventually add
functionality that allows users to register a pseudonym that takes the
place of that common-name+fingerprint-prefix pair and would be more human
friendly.

Ah... and another point... how does the server know when to stop reading
the body of a request that pairs up with a 12? Well... there's a deadline
on the connection. You'll want to get all your data across before then. We
don't really like that that's all we have... we've thought about
implementing something more, but other options currently feel just as
arbitrary... some max byte size?

Finally - thanks for reading all this. I need to stop typing... I've been
typing this for the last hour and a half! :-D

If a status code of 12 makes it in to the spec or not is fine with us. We'd
love to see more servers and clients fight for the user. (Yes, I've been
watching certain movies recently.) We believe creation of content should be
as simple as consumption, and we're enjoying exploring this approach as an
option.

Thanks!

May be a convention:

$URL + ".asc" MAY give you access to a signature of $URL?

Apologies for not trimming, I just left all of that intact above. Hey
Sean, we've been down this road well over a year ago, 14 September
2019 here on the list. Very early on in Gemini development.

You are correct, by why are we revisiting this again? Perhaps just a
link to the Subject thread: *URLs in request lines*, would suffice?

I'll make it simple ;) Here it is, from a post of mine, citing you, in
the middle of the thread back when we had less than a dozen servers in
Gemini space :)

https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2019/000160.html

I hope that helps!

Not really. A certificate is basically a public key plus some metadata
(identity, signature, expiration date, etc). Certificates are
typically public (with TLS 1.2, they are even sent in clear). It is
the knowledge of the private key that allows client certificates to be
used as an authentication tool.

Clearly! In addition to this, even if it were possible, as web pages
embed other things it would be of no use.

Right ^^ So every browser would be able to render the page as usual.
 
There may be several modes:

* The browser is configured to not care about signature. Everything go
  as usual. Just like any non-aware browser.

* The browser is configured to indicate that this file exists, but does
  nothing. It would display a special icon https-style.

* The user would ask the browser to check for a particular site or for
  all sites.

A per-site setting would accept an error in the signature or not.

The rest follow the spirit of "Trust on first use". For instance,
storing the public key of the author in the website. Maybe a kinda
web-of-trust among some websites gathered in rings?

Say : gemini://website.invalid/.well-known/tofu/certificate

Context: /gredig/v is a cgi script which outputs text/gemini containing 
links "fra/v" and "intro.gmi".

This looks to me like the result of a client (or bot, but judging from 
timestamps I'm guessing an interactive client) which assumes that an URL 
without a '.' must be missing a trailing slash. Combined with 
molly-brown's behaviour of running the cgi script /foo if it exists when 
responding to a request for /foo/bar, this explains the log.

None of the clients I've tested behave like this, but I haven't tested 
many.

The only way that can work is for the client to automatically request the
signature when a document is retrieved.  This has two problems:  (a) it is
an automatic network action, which clients are not supposed to do, and (b)
it will cause a lot of useless hits when signatures are rare, which is bad
considering that Gemini servers are often limited by either CPU or network
bandwidth.

I think the Right Thing is for browsers to have a command/menu option
"Check Signature", which appends ".asc" to the pathname of the current URI
(not to the whole URI), and attempts to retrieve that. If it succeeds and
the content matches the current document, all is well.

However, this assumes that the signature methodology is standardized across
all sites.  So a simpler, more Gemini thing to do is to replace "Check
Signature" with "View Signature", which displays the signature and leaves
it to the user to determine the signature on the local copy of the document.


> * The user would ask the browser to check for a particular site or for

WI don't understand this: signatures are per-document, not per-site.  And
hat does "all sites" even mean?  Even "all documents on the site" does not
need to be a finite number, given the ability to generate documents at the
server.

The rest follow the spirit of "Trust on first use". For instance,
> storing the public key of the author in the website. Maybe a kinda

The server can't assume that all documents have the same author, so servers
have to be per-document, not per-site.  This adds complexity to the server,
as it has to maintain additional metadata as opposed to keeping either
signature files or a rewrite rule that requests signature files from a
different, more secure site.  The latter is the Right Thing when mirroring
documents from elsewhere: if your server is hacked, the hacker will
certainly alter the signature as well, but if the signature is off site,
that is more difficult.

It was dreary and wearisome.  Cold clammy winter still held sway in this

greasy surfaces of the sullen waters.  Dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed

You could for that matter rename it to ????????, assuming you have a
Classical Greek keyboard.  (If you have a modern one, which is somewhat
more likely, just leave out the rough breathing and call it ????????,
though that is not an actual Modern Greek word.)

For anyone who is wondering, nobody knows why the word changed gender from
masculine in Greek to feminine in Latin.

Subject: [tech] gmnhg v0.1.1 (Hugo-to-Gemini site converter)
Message-ID: <20210219213741.gys5v35owjtk3mpd@haseul>

So this piece of software got a bugfix release [1] that:

* fixes gmnhg crash when site directory doesn't contain static/ dir
* fixes an additional trailing newline rendered in any Markdown file

Of course I totally had to break the public API of the library in a bugfix 
release, but v0 kinda made that decision lighter to make.

If anyone missed that (and it was not very hard to miss that, considering I 
never announced its release on this list at the first place, only posting that 
to awesome-gemini [2]), gmnhg is a program that generates a static Gemini site 
that can be hosted with any static Gemini server (I use Satellite [3] myself) 
from your existing Hugo content, with a minimal set of additional templates. The 
repo also includes a library to convert Markdown to Gemtext, and md2gmn, a 
simple frontend to the library.

There are limits to what the renderer can handle (most notably links in lists, 
which IIRC weren't tackled due to a gomarkdown bug), but it still makes writing 
cross-web/Gemini content somewhat easier.

The piece of software is as far away as running:

% GO111MODULE=on go get -v git.tdem.in/tdemin/gmnhg/cmd/gmnhg at v0.1.1
% GO111MODULE=on go get -v git.tdem.in/tdemin/gmnhg/cmd/md2gmn at v0.1.1

is. The docs are perfectly readable with go doc.

I am also wondering this. It's great you're creating content, it's what Gemini
needs, but I don't think announcing each post on the mailing list is the way to go.

Message-ID: <3d9fc686d3fa40083e8b3b776a7a874595401f5a.camel@vinishor.xyz>

Hello everyone.

I'd like to share a small project I made after reading lots of mails in
this mailling-list. I liked the concept of gmi.si3t.ch, so I decided to
create a capsule hosting service on my OpenBSD VM. I use a chrooted
SFTP server to serve content.

It's open to everyone, even if the main page is in French only (might
translate it later in English, so don't worry). Currently, I'm hosting
my own capsule on it.

For its hostname, I chose unbon.cafe which means "A good coffee" in
French :)

If you have any questions or suggestions, you can mail me to this
address :)

See you later in gemspace!

=> gemini://unbon.cafe (in French)
=> gemini://unbon.cafe/vinishor My capsule in French

You are right. That's why the others way come.

Each page would have the ".asc" file. I suppose this file would link to
the certificate. Such certificate may be found somewhere in the server,
publicly accessible.

That's right, it's always security vs. functionality. At least, each
page may be signed before publication by the uploader.

Thank you, this is what should be done. Just linked to it on my capsule, but this should be on the Web too. Move it around.

Hello! We launched a static site hosting service for the web yesterday

sircmpwn.srht.site) that they can publish a capsule at, and we provide
hosting for anyone who wants to bring their own domain along as well.

You can find the details here:

Thank you Stephane - it is interesting to see the shape of the 
geminiverse resources. It also helps to tune some typical client default 
parameters for max resource size before abandoning a client connection - 
as we know there is no Content-Length to know how much content to expect.

I know it is cheeky to keep coming with new suggestions - but it would 
be handy to know some time what is the shape of the predominant gemini 
resource - text/gemini. I assume that currently the stats apply to all 
resources, so may be skewed up due to binary files etc.

Regards

 ?- Luke

I thought about signing things as well (trying to confirm, that
these posts were published by the owner of the corresponding
private key).
=> gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/~ew/2020/20201217-towards-a-proper-flightlog-4.gmi

I went for a file, which holds all sha512sums of all posts and
files, and sign only that. This seemed like a good idea at the
time, because my average post was like 1500 Byte, and adding a
clearsign signature would add something like 800 Bytes to every
post.

Now, a growing site will lead to a big sha512sums file, it is
clearly not good for automated checking (by the browser).
Currently I don't have better ideas other than to add such
signature files per year (separate folder).

Cheers,
~ew

Ive been using this and it is very helpful, re: the thread grouping. I did
notice the `Math Notation in Gemini?` thread is broken across two entries.
Is that a bug or due to the way that someone set the To/CC fields in their

Subject: [SPEC] Users actions should only trigger an unique request
Message-ID: <20210220234225.2debcf9b@kongroo.lan>

Hi,

It doesn't seem that the specification is clear that requesting
a page shouldn't download other resources.

This raises concerns and questions about inline data, currently
in-line pictures are supported by Lagrange browser (not a default
though).

Some people noticed /favicon.txt errors in their logs, it turned out
the Amphora client implemented an Emoji favicon support (disabled by
default)[1] which already help tracking Amphora users. Someone made
a ticket to ask removing this feature [2] but per the spec, it is
not allowed or forbidden.

I propose to add in the current specification in "1.1 Gemini
transactions" something like "Every request should match an unique
user action" or "Users actions must correspond to an unique request"?
The point is that when an user load a new page or follow a link
(document or gemini page) only ONE request must be made. This would
mean inline pre-loading is forbidden per the specification or that
metadata like favicons are forbidden too.

In regards to privacy and security, it is important for users to feel
confident that their client is not doing more than what they ask.
?I click on this link, my client request and display the content.?
and nothing more behind the scenes.

"Gemini interprets extensibility as a side-channel attack, and routes 
around it."

I support Solene's proposal (though I have not read the exact proposed 
wording). If the proposal is accepted into the spec, I'd also suggest that 
clients that violate it on this point be removed from the list of
Gemini clients on the main webpages. This feels uncharacteristically 
heavy-handed by my standards, but there appears no other way to stop 
Gemini being forcibly evolved in a way that damages its value to many 
users.

Amazing!! I might give this a look, though I'm happy with my VPS right 
now.

If it ever offers something more than a VPS, like a CDN, I might switch 
my static hosting over. Maybe.

But for others, this could really help reduce dependence on proprietary 
services like GitHub Pages or Netlify.

Message-ID: <CAFTy05bJcAAS_CFt=52cEk_cCPUrKM2HNQqfx8Nq2qiJeXdUQw@mail.gmail.com>

I feel like I should say something as the author of the controversial
gemini favicon RFC [0].

This comment was posted earlier today by ddevault on the Amfora issue
tracker [1].

> Every gemini page shall complete in a single gemini request. Please

And continuing in the following comment (after makeworld expressed
some reservations).

> This is the only means we have of self regulation. I'll ask nicely
> first but ultimately I'll do what I have to in order to preserve
> Gemini's simplicity and utility as a small internet protocol.

> Period.

This is disgraceful, shameless intimidation.

Note the deliberate timing of when this issue was raised.
gemini://srht.site was announced just a few hours earlier and the
obvious expectation is that ddevault will soon host a significant
portion of gemini capsules in the wild. He now has the power he
needs to make demands of other gemini developers.

The threat isn?t to blackhole all requests to /favicon.txt, which
might have been considered reasonable. No, the thread is to blackhole
the IP address of every amfora user, cutting them off from a large
swath of gemini and thereby crippling the client. Destroying the
hundreds of hours that makeworld has no doubt spent building up his
software and community. Unless he submits, unwavering, to ddevault?s
ultimatum to "fix" his software.

And it worked.

Think carefully about the consequences of using gemini://srht.site.

Now, switching gears to rant about gemini more broadly. For context,
I was one of the earliest adopters of gemini, although I don?t have
any ties to its inception and the group of people who brainstormed
ideas for the initial spec. I was a spectator who stumbled upon it
while I was browsing through bongusta! one day [2].

Solderpunk and the FAQ [3] are wrong about gemini. Gemini?s success
is not because the protocol was designed to be restrictive, or secure,
or accessible, or any other post-hoc rationalization that one might
come up with to explain why gemini is better than the web.

Gemini is nothing more than a set of common-sense solutions to
problems that were expressed by the gopher community around the time.
By ?gopher community? I don?t mean the UMN gopher/gopher+ of the 90?s
which is long since dead. I mean the modern gopher revival of the
post 2000?s, which is *completely* different in both form and
function. Gopher has not survived the past 30 years because the
protocol was simple and restrictive. On the contrary, gopher has
evolved profoundly.

So then what?s so special about gemini? Why not stick to gopher? Put
simply, it was time for gopher to evolve again. The gopher community
wanted more. But we had reached the limit of what was capable without
breaking gopher in backwards incompatible ways. Thus gemini was
conceived to fill that gap. This is such an important distinction to
make. Gemini was *not* born to add restrictions to an increasingly
bloated web. Gemini was born to release the shackles of a legacy
gopher protocol.

The secret to gemini is not what it restricts; but what it enables.
Constraint breeds creativity. This is the reason that gopher and
gemini have been successful. A bunch of tinkerers, hackers, artists,
poets, and makers found a new medium to express themselves. Or
rather, a bunch of normal folks like you and me discovered that we
*can* be those things if we want to be.

It?s the magic of the smolnet. It?s fleeting; you can?t capture it in
a bottle and you can?t freeze it in time by locking down the spec.
Enjoy it while it lasts. I came up with the favicon emoji RFC because
I thought it was a fun idea. I ported botany to gemini because I
thought it was a fun idea. Don?t stifle your own ideas out of fear of
what will happen to gemini://. Gemini will evolve whether you want it to
or not.

Not just yet! I take back my initial quick decision to remove them. I hate
having to go back and forth on this, but I think it's important.

As the developer of Amfora, I'm genuinely unsure what to do here. I feel
uncomfortable at being at the centre of this, but also intrigued at what this
means for Gemini and its future.

I'd like to make a small correction to your email:

 > No, the threat is to blackhole the IP address of every amfora user, cutting
 > them off from a large swath of gemini and thereby crippling the client.

Drew's idea would only blackhole Amfora users who had enabled the the favicon
feature, which is off by default, to respect Gemini's one request philosophy.

However this is still a tactic I strongly disagree with, and although Drew said
(on IRC) he considered "banhammering" a last resort, I don't think it should be
on the table at all for clients that are not causing any server problems.

To be honest, I am leaning to keeping the feature, because it's what I want, and
it's my client, goddamnit! If Drew still says he will go ahead with the
blackhole then I will add a manual exception for his domains. This is obviously
an ugly thing to do, reminiscent of WebKit Quirks[1], but I don't see another
option.

  But it fits with his character.  When I asked for the IP address of his
web proxy to block it (because of his refusal to support robots.txt), he 
resorted to name calling:
  
        https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/003509.html

(Note for non-US readers:  The term "dick" is a slang term for "penis" and
is used as a slur against other males.  It is *also* true that "Dick" is a
legitimate name (a short form for "Richard"), but as I'm not named
"Richard", nor is Drew, it was obviously a slur against me.)

  It does come across as Drew saying "blocking is for me, not for thee.")

  I am not fond of Drew (and it's for more than his just calling me a bad
name), but I'm trying square his actions against mine from 2019.  For
context, I was *the* first adopter of Gemini, writing my own server even
before Solderpunk could write one (for the record: he wrote the second
Gemini server).  I *broke* the spec with my implementation, not at all
agreeing with Solderpunk about some pretty fundamental issues with the
protocol, because at *that* time, the protocol:

	used single digit resonse codes
	no support for client certificates
	a link line of [text|url]
	no virtual hosting
	a request format ala gopher (including TABs!)
	no rediection
	no indication of pages are actually gone vs not found
	no MIME parameters

  I like to think I wasn't quite the dictator that Drew comes across as (in
both his Amfora ticket, or this message to the list:

	https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/003506.html

Who put *him* in charge of Gemini?)  I had (well, still have) strong
opinions on Gemini, but I did present my arguments for certain features, and
against others.  And it wasn't uncommon in the early days of sweeping
changes and mass updates to clients *and* servers.

  As a consequence, I find this seeming charge of "don't change the spec
EVER!" troublesome.  That once Solderpunk (where *IS* he, by the way?) makes
the few changes that are requested, that's it.  It's done.  No more
experimentation.  Ever.  It feels as if Gemini is ossifying even before it's
set in stone.  It's a weird feeling.

  I thought the favicon emoji was a fun idea.  I still do.  I even support
it on my server.  Astrobotany is a *wonderful* use of client certificates
(and something I was hoping would happen when I was pushing for their use).

  Keep the feature but don't add a "quirks" mode.  It will hurt Drew in the
long term.  I use Amfora and enable favicon.txt support.  I go to Drew's
site and get banned.  Oh, Amfora isn't working for his site, let me try
another client.  Oh, I'm *still* banned?  WTF?  Okay, I'll just skip this
snowflake site then.  Or maybe I (and other former Amfora users who got
banned and switched clients) send email to Drew asking to be reinstated.

I support the idea of not loading anything beyond what the user
asked. Thus no favicons.

Data parsimony is something which affects metadata at least as
much as data. Only (meta)data, which is not available to begin
with, is good data. Yes, yes, I know, that would mean I should
disconnect my notebook and shut up. :) If I do not speak, I
accept whatever comes up.

So my vote: keep it minimal, please.

But what if the user does ask for favicons?

I do not like the favicon specifications personaly, so I would not activate it if my browser adds support for it.
But I did add icons to most of my capsules for people who use it, and I feel forbidding such thing by specification is a strong overstepping of the specification.

I see Gemini as a protocol specification and feel like it should not overstep too much on how the protocol is used. Conventions and specifications based upon Gemini will happen even if you don?t want it.

I even host a list of such specifications here: gemini://gemlog.lanterne.chilliet.eu/specifications.en.gmi (Do not hesitate to send me missing ones)

Message-ID: <32825ecc-3d75-56fb-4cd7-c5708392e06c@valvin.fr>

Hello,

My curiosity about Gemini lead me to think about how to host easily many
different domain on the same server.

I have a simple idea which consists in publishing static content from a
git repository. And allow users to update their content by updating a
git repository and maybe through an interface later.

For this I imagine using containerization with an existing gemini
server. Here I've tested Agate :
https://gitlab.com/valvin/gemini-agate-image

Deploying a single hostname is ok. But I'm wondering how to deploy many
hostnames using the same public IP(v4) address. With HTTP we are used to
deploy a reverse proxy (nginx, haproxy, traefik...). It allowes then to
split traffic based on the DNS name requested in the "Host" header.

TCP load-balacing doesn't allow this I think but maybe I'm wrong. It
requires to get the information of hostname in the request.

So I'm wondering if there is not yet something that has been done about
this. Or maybe I miss somethin
g in TCP load-balancing and it is possible
to do this already.


Thank you

Valvin.

I obviously wasn't clear enough. :)
IFF the user asks for them, all is fine, imho.
IFF the browser just does this behind my neck without my explicit
consent, then no thanks.
The /automatic/ thing is, what bothers me.

I'm well aware that monitoring the sizes and/or times of
downloads leads to metadata useable for fingerprinting. Getting
rid of this kind of meta data (connection between A and B
occured Date-Time) is difficult.

Hey folks,

I hope chiming in tangentially like this isn't a faux pas.

I just wanted to say that I am grateful for all of you skilled and wise
(and opinionated) people here on this list and Gemini at large. I
consider myself among the most plebian of laymen, and have learned A LOT
keeping an ear to the pavement about all things Gemini here. I am
grateful that there are so many passionate and knowledgeable people
caring about Gemini. 

In regard to the issue of this thread, I see many people whom I admire
and respect expressing valid concerns about an important issue. I hope
that all concerned parties here can hear each other, and that with this
issue and others, we can proceed with an underatanding that agreement
is not a condition of community. There are many passionate people
residing in Geminispace, and I hope that we can appreciate that even
those with whom we disagree are in fact not only our neighbors, but 
also our closest allies.

This is my ignorant and biased two cents. I do not mean to mininize
anyone's opinion here, of course. Just wanted to remind all of you that
there are a lot of people out here who appreciate that all of you care
so much. Now I'm off to dick around (isn't English fun?) on one of my 
many obscure capsules :)

Good night Gemini,
~mieum

I had almost the same use-case for my small gemini server and wrote a
proxy that only does vhost routing:

gemini://repos.wetterberg.nu/~hugo_wetterberg/gemini-proxy

But if you're serving static files/some CGI you're probably better off
following mieums advice and use a server that uses different docroots
for different hostnames. Then you don't have to layer different proxies
and servers, and it's easy to combine that workflow with git post-
recieve hooks that generates the static files.

With modern TLS, we use "Server Name Indication" to accommodate this. 
The client stuffs the requested domain name into the TLS negotiation's
ClientHello.

>From the gemini spec:

4 TLS

Use of TLS for Gemini transactions is mandatory. Use of the Server Name
Indication (SNI) extension to TLS is also mandatory, to facilitate name-based
virtual hosting. 

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication & https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6066 for more details.

What we have here, is a little cancel culture fun goin' on ;)

Let's play paint the asshats into a corner, shall we? You decide which
folks get loaded on the train to oblivion okay?

What I'm really upset about here, is the fact that the last bambi I
murdered for food got incinerated coz I couldn't get it down off the
mountaiin when my part of the mountain was engulfed by the fires. I
barely made it out myself, and were it not for a grower who knew I was
probably still on the mountain and completely unaware of the evacuation
orders, I would have been cooked myself.

So I come back, to what, this? Hey I took couple of glances at the list
and how the Gemini space has grown, along with the explosive adoption of
this experimental protocol and though to myself, "Man, it's still in the
spirit of the old NSFnet AUP - that's awesome.

Now I learn that someone is disrespecting me. This will not stand.

For the better part of two decades, my friends and colleagues on the
Gopher list have chided me for my refusal to accept proxies which permit
people to use HTTP protocol to access my gopherholes. Yet in that time,
I have NEVER come accross an administrator who outright refused to
accept my personal **choice** to disallow such proxies to invade my
network space.

It may be not in alignment with what others have wanted, in order to
repopularize the Gopher protocol, but I am, and always have been, a firm
believer that if you want to surf any protocol space, then you should
use the tools specifically designed for those purposes. I lamented the
removal of Gopher protocol from the **browsers*, and subesquently,
cogitated over why one would even bother having an http:// in the
address bar if that's ultimately going to be the only supported method
of browsing, all of this while Geocities went lights out and Angelfire
stopped showing up in SERPs... and people became the dopamine enslaved
property of private enterprise that butcherd and packaged and wrapped us
in celophane with a price tag as they placed us into inventory.

So here comes this new thang using TCP 1965 and I'm like, "Okay, kewl!
That's how we extend Gopher to a new beginning without damaging it or
crippling the backward compatibility of it, and we can leave port 70
alone, without losing what is so great about the protocol!"

>From the lessons learned in hindsight with respect to functionality and
utility, Gemini introduced a novel methodology that is, or at least was
until a couple of days ago, adventerous, experimental, with that
sensible utility and above all, not afraid to examine ideas and kick
them around a bit.

I was so excited when the first time Gemini space delivered to me an
almost discernable ANSI graphics file. I know most of you weren't even
born when that was a thing, long before most everyone here was privy to
ARPANET access. But it was a big deal for me.

And now, instead of simply discussing the virtues that include the pros
and cons, with demonstrated test cases, some latecomers are showing up,
drawing lines in the sand with their divisive sticks, and making threats
against the people who have put in the hard work and actually built
Gemini in the first place? How dare you?

To see the creators and original pioneers, so to speak, of the Gemini
protocol threatened and bullied like this? Especially the gentlemen
whose servers most everyone in Gemini space actually run themselves?

I dunno what Faceplant taught y'all, but if it was kneejerk reactions
are something you think is a noble thing then maybe you learned well,
and maybe you should just keep on Faceplanting and cutting off a few
more pounds of flesh for Google, and those who would refuse to respect
the wishes of server admins that don't want their services bastardized
by proxies delivering their content to people in HTTP space.

Now, threatening people like the authors of Amfora, and Jetforce, and
GLV-1.12556 (the first ever Gemini server)? Man that's not just bad
form, it's borderline ad homonym - a bannable offense in most treatises
of netiquette. The people I've just mentioned are the people who made
possible your very enjoyment of this novel service answering on TCP
1965, and you have the audacity to dangle deplatforming at them? Do you
wish to incite a Hatfield and McCoy like volley?

I don't think so. Chill, have a crumpet, watch an old episode of Lost in
Space, or listen to a a good death metal band live in concert, or a
string quartet performing Bach - whatever floats your boat and takes you
to that happy place of yours. If you don't, everyone will end up with
urine on their pant legs and that's stinky, to say the least.

Now, I've personally just discovered Lagrange, and I must say I'm
enamored of it. It fricken' rocks and at this time is my goto GUI client
for Gemini (and  Gopher). My fav is however,  still Elpher, and no, I'm
still a Vim guy, but that's okay. I've seen people rave about how kewl
other clients are, some I like, some I feel are lacking with respect to
my needs, and ALL of that is okay. I even prefer using some really
rickety old and unmaintained CLI based clients.

So let's talk not talk about ultimatums, but instead, about choices.
About user choices and about server admin choices and the rules they
adopt as their acceptable use policies. If a server admin says, "You
can't put up content on my servers with favicons - then fricken' don't
do that!

but don't be an asshat and say you'll ban the IPs of people using
clients that support a feature you can otherwise prohibit your
respective userbase as part of your terms of service, or threaten to
lobby for the deplatforming of well meaning, enthusiastic developers -
that's childish, that's juvenile, that's moronic.

That's as stupid as the crippleware that Tusky became when it violated
the philosophy of FOSS and user empowerment by hardcoding philosophy
into the client. You take away the empowerment of the user and you're no
better than Dorsey or Ellison or Zuckerberg or ABC... Don't be evil my
ass, that's exactly what ABC has become.

If a user says, I don't want favicons coz I'll get tracked (ridiculous
reasoning, but as valid as any other preference), then either use a
client that doesn't support that or find the dev of your fav client and
ask them if they'll integrate such configurability into their client
that allows you to hold the pickles and lettuce. Special orders really
don't upset them, and if you do it in the form of a patch or pull
request, even better!

You need to realize that you're speaking to creators - people who like
to build things, and more often than not, it actually makes their day
when they know someone likes their product enough to ask for a feature
to be added. That's actually flattery man!, Flatter them. Thank them.
Let them know, as a consumer of their products that you have things you
think would be beneficial.

That's how you affect change.

Or you can threaten. And cancel yourself.

The truth about tracking, is that you can't do anything about stopping a
provider from attempting to do so. You're in their syslogs, their
firewall logs, and they can fingerprint you from other remote resources.
No one, that I'm aware of here, is interested in tracking anyone in
Gemini space. That will not always be the case, and already there are
those who are in earnest betrayal of the trust of this community, and as
is typical, those people are the individuals that are clamoring the
loudest for control, slinging threats, and engaging in ad homonym.

I'm seeing all kinds of new ideas and proposals and questions put into
experimentation for feasibility and that's part of what Project Gemini
is about (for example:
gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/~ew/2020/20201217-towards-a-proper-flightlog-4.gmi
), some fly, some don't. Some are adopted even though the use cases are
narrow while others are popular and detested by many - for those latter
cases, we have three choices, that of user configurability, that of
server administrative policy, and official canonization into the spec.
That third item of remediation is, of course, the weakest of all
remedies when a popular functionality is the topic. Anyone can fork an
existing project and launch a death star. Don't kid yourselves, and it
will happen. It already has actually, there's a Richard Cranium out
there in Gemini space disrespecting robots.txt - and that's a very real,
clear, and imminent threat to privacy.


I hope that helps :)

I love amfora and I'm not using that favicons thing because I cannot see the point of that on amfora. I works nicely without it. 

However,

I will still support and use amfora no matter what the developer _chooses_ to do on this issue.

And specially,

I will still support and use amfora no matter what anybody elses chooses to do. In other words, whoever chooses to blcok amfora chooses to block me, as well, fwiw, for I will _not_ be using anything else to access such sites. 

My usual reaction to matter as these is to ask everyone to cool off a bit, and maybe re-formulate their concerns in a more positive way. It would be still a valid point. However, I do think I owe, we owe, a bit of respect to every contributor to Gemini. And certainly that's the case for Amfora.

Reading about favicon in Gemini by way of an extra request to the host 
serving a requested document, I searched for "metadata" in old threads.

It seems to me the quoted message from 2020-11-14 below could serve as a 
solution to the debate.

Note that the favicon RFC basically uses this approach itself, stating 
some `key: value` pairs within the document.

=> gemini://mozz.us/files/rfc_gemini_favicon.gmi RFC: Adding Emoji 
Favicons to Gemini

Why not use this kind of structured metadata lines for an (as per RFC 
still unmotivated) favicon convention?

It seems your are suggesting implementing equivalent of http headers
that are key: values pair and are not part of the document but is transmitted
in the reply. Currently gemini only returns the status code, the content type
and potentially the language (this is not mandatory).

That's an endless rabbithole that the Gemini protocol should better
not explore because it allows endless extendability.

Just to be clear: The user has to explicitly enable the feature in Amfora. The
requests will happen automatically once it is enable, however.

To be honest I'm not sure, I haven't dug into it, but I have seen it happen in a few places. I suspect that a reply was sent without including the "in-reply-to" header, but I'm not sure under what conditions that happens. There is one more issue that the topics are listed by creation date, rather than getting bumped up by last activity date, but I'm fine with it as-is for browsing through historical posts, especially because the code is surprisingly small and simple (only 55 lines of Python code!).

As Dave was saying, SNI is madatory on Gemini; clients during the TLS
handshake tells the server which domain they want to talk to, and so the
server can use the correct certificate and serve the right stuff.
Support for this varies between servers.

Agate supports multiple hosts it, search for "Virtual Hosts" (that's how
they're called) in the readme, but with the limitation of only one
certificate.  Other servers (I'll shameless advertise my own) like
gmid[0] or solene' vger[1] supports multiple virtual hosts, with
different certificates too.

It's also bad on a technical level.  It would only take one bad actor to
get all Tor exits blocked.  This also applies to other shared IPs like
VPN exits and other proxies.

It's a pity that Drew chose this off-putting type of approach.  It tends
to have the reverse effect.

A good argument against automated favicon requests is that they
contribute to fingerprinting.  Not by much, but little things like this
can add up.  The alternative approaches suggested by Drew don't have
this problem:

Hello and thank you all for you replies.

It looks SNI is what I was looking for. In my use case I'd like each
virtual host runs individually whith their own certificates but hosted
on the same IP.

I think Hugo solution already implements something near of what I need.
I'll test it quickly.

It looks I have many things to discover like all the server
implementations ;)

# Overview

I like the idea of supporting the creating-users freedom to choose to have
their content only accessible through the gemini protocol. (Of course this
support only goes so far - once content is available, it's available.
Stopping someone from taking what you've made available and doing what they
will with it... short of a legal license and litigation... ugh.)

So... I have an HTTP Proxy and, while I provide a robots.txt, I'd like to
explore going a step further. I'd like to provide a URL path prefix like:
/internal/blacklist

The process I'm thinking of is explained in more detail below, but the
result would be that the HTTP Proxy refuses to forward requests to
self-blacklisted Gemini hosts.


# An Example

Before the process, going to https://gem.ondollo.com/external/ondollo.com
would return the gemini/text content available at gemini://ondollo.com to
the requesting web browser.

After the process, going to https://gem.ondollo.com/external/ondollo.com
would *not* return the gemini/text content available at gemini://ondollo.com

Maybe the proxy could instead return a page that says... "The owner of this
content has requested that it only be accessible through the gemini
protocol and we respect that. Please use a Gemini client to access content
at gemini://ondollo.com. Here are some recommended clients: <list of one or
more clients>"

... or... the HTTP Proxy could just 404? 400? 204 Success and no content?
301 Moved permanently with a gemini URI? 403 Forbidden (not a *user* authz
issue... but a *proxy* authz issue...)? 410 Gone? 451 Legal? (As an aside:
there is a part of me that loves discussions/debates around what the right
HTTP status code is for a given situation... there's another part of me
that dies every time...)

I think I'll go for a 200 HTTP status and content that explains what
happened and encourages the user to access the content through gemini.


# A Possible Request Response Sequence

Here's a sequence I'm thinking of (given a creating-user and their gemini
server at gemhost, and a consuming-user and their web browser... and the
proxy at proxyhost... and 'somepath' - a sufficiently unique and random URL
path):

 1. The creating-user makes a new document on their server available at
<gemhost>/<somepath> with the content <proxyhost>
 2. The creating-user makes an HTTP GET request to
<proxyhost>/internal/blacklist/<gemhost>/<somepath>
 3. The proxy makes a Gemini request to <gemhost>/<somepath> and gets the
content that matches themself - their own proxyhost value
 4. The proxyhost adds the gemhost to their blacklist
 5. The proxyhost refuses to proxy requests to the gemhost

Thoughts? How would you tweak to get the desired outcome?


# An Alternative

An additional thought I had... the above feels like it might be too process
heavy (but... it's also super simple...). What if proxy server
implementations were encouraged to check gemini://<gemhost>/noproxy.txt
before a request? (Every request? Feels too much like the favicon. The
first request? What if the creating-user changes their mind?) If my proxy
checks that URL and gets a 20 status back, then it refuses to proxy the
connection. If it gets a 51 back, then it continues with proxying the
request.

So... who does the work? Proxy implementers would be encouraged to make
modifications with either approach... but the first approach has no work by
gemini server implementers, just creating-users. The second approach could
have some work by gemini server implementors... but little by
content-users... maybe they toggle a setting in the server to respond with
a 20 to /noproxy.txt requests?

Thoughts?

404, 204 and 410 I think are definitely the wrong codes.
A 3xx redirect would be bad as it may cause confusion for non-gemini
folks and browsers.
451 & 403 would ~kinda make sense.

I'm going to add to the list these two, which I think may somewhat fit
when someone is trying to access gemini-only content via HTTP:

406 Not Acceptable:
> The requested resource is capable of generating only content not acceptable according to the Accept headers sent in the request.

405 Method Not Allowed:
> A request method is not supported for the requested resource; for example, a GET request on a form that requires data to be presented via POST, or a PUT request on a read-only resource.

I'm not expert on HTTP though :p so I'm likely to be wrong.

This isn't headers of any sort, it's document metadata, similar to
HTML's <head> and <meta>.

Message-ID: <CAEzvDCVLyfcGAYcvxxPaK_o9RW=TU5g_tvmUeuswFw7FRCm5SQ@mail.gmail.com>

Many of us strongly believe in the one pageload generates one request
philosophy, including me, but metadata is also nice to have. While you
could put metadata in other files, that would result in multiple requests
being made. Instead, I am proposing a new file format,
text/gemini-metadata+json, to be used in data URIs in Gemtext. It would be
json (simply because it is popular and has wide support) with specified
keys. Possible things to include in the metadata could be a favicon (be it
emoji or otherwise), a theme color or color scheme to be used by the client
as it wishes, etc.
It would be used like this:

```
# My super cool gemsite
Welcome!

=> data:text/gemini-metadata+json;charset=utf-8,{"favicon":"?%E2%80%8D?"}
Page metadata
```

A Gemini client implementing this would add a check for links starting with
data:text/gemini-metadata+json to it's rendering code and when it
encounters one, decode it and take note of the metadata. Clients not
implenenting it will just see a link to the data, degrading (imo) quite
gracefully. I can't decide if the link should be hidden or not in browsers
with support though. If the link is hidden then the client should make sure
to expose the metadata elsewhere in the interface.
Please give all the feedback!

I'd go with 502 Bad Gateway and an explanation.

SVGs when rendered as images (on the web) can't make network calls or run
JS. I assume libraries expose this option.


SVGs can be used in web browsers several ways. These are the places they
can run JS.

- They can be loaded standalone with no HTML (by browsing directly to the
file)
- They can be inline as an <svg> tag
- They can be <embed>ded

They can also be used as an image, and can't run JS or make network
requests (ex. load fonts) if used this way
- They can be used as an <img> src
- They can be a CSS background

CSS and animations work everywhere.

  After reading up on HTTP response codes, I think the most appropriate one
is 409 Conflict.  The HTTP spec (RFC-2616, section 10.4.10, with added
commentary from me):

	The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the
	current state of the resource. 

The owner of the Gemini server does not want data proxied to HTTP.

	This code is only allowed in situations where it is expected that
	the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the
	request.

To resolve the situation, use an actual Gemini client.

	The response body SHOULD include enough information for the user to
	recognize the source of the conflict.  Ideally, the response entity
	would include enough information for the user or user agent to fix
	the problem; however, that might not be possible and is not
	required.

Which can be included in the body of the 409 response (most, if not all, web
servers allow custom error pages to be sent).

  Short of that, then 407 Proxy Authentication Required is the next best
one, kind of.  The semantics are perfect, but it would seem to apply
(RFC-2616, section 10.4.8):

	This code is similar to 401 (Unauthorized), but indicates that the
	client must first authenticate itself with the proxy. The proxy MUST
	return a Proxy-Authenticate header field (section 14.33) containing
	a challenge applicable to the proxy for the requested resource. The
	client MAY repeat the request with a suitable Proxy-Authorization
	header field (section 14.34). HTTP access authentication is
	explained in "HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access
	Authentication"

  If only there was a file that automated agents already use ... like
robots.txt, where one could do something like ...

	User-agent: proxy
	Disallow: /

I loved Opera's native navigation support for HTML's rel prev/next tags.

Hi,

why is robots.txt not the obvious answer here? The companion specification[1] has a "User-agent: webproxy" for this specific case:

 > ### Web proxies
 > Gemini bots which fetch content in order to translate said content into HTML and publicly serve the result over HTTP(S) (in order to make Geminispace accessible from within a standard web browser) should respect robots.txt directives aimed at a User-agent of "webproxy".

So this should suffice:

```
User-agent: webproxy
Disallow: /
```

Regards,
Johann

I must admit, I'm woefully lacking skill or background with robots.txt. It
seems like it could be a great answer.

A few questions to help me educate myself:

 1. How often should that file be referenced by the proxy? It feels like an
answer might be, to check that URL before every request, but that goes in
the direction of some of the negative feedback about the favicon. One user
action -> one gemini request and more.
 2. Is 'webproxy' a standard reference to any proxy, or is that something
left to us to decide?
 3. Are there globbing-like syntax rules for the Disallow field?
 4. I'm assuming there could be multiple rules that need to be mixed. Is
there a standard algorithm for that process? E.g.:
User-agent: webproxy
Disallow: /a
Allow: /a/b
Disallow: /a/b/c

Again - it seems like this could work out really well.

Thanks for helping me learn a bit more!

There is currently only the content type in it and possibiliy the lang metadata added for text/gemini types.

Maybe I missed something about it in the spec, but it's really vague,

 My implementations of server/client use the META field to communicate
between the server and the user (through the client) - and in many cases,
the value in META *is* limited and well defined by the current spec.

See the 10 and 11 status codes - the prompt that the user should be shown
is the value of the META field.

The 3x status codes - the META is the location the server is redirecting
the client to.

Etc. (there are other places that META has specific meaning - even if the
exact value is left up to the implementor , like on status 10 - as the spec
says, the meaning of META is <STATUS> dependent)

Does that help?

That sounds neat, would be useful for orbits/webrings (such as LEO).
The current link system works ok, but can be a bit clunky.

While you could put metadata in other files, that would result in multiple requests being made. Instead, I am proposing a new file format, text/gemini-metadata+json, to be used in data URIs in Gemtext. It would be json (simply because it is popular and has wide support) with specified keys. Possible things to include in the metadata could be a favicon (be it emoji or otherwise), a theme color or color scheme to be used by the client as it wishes, etc.

Clients not implenenting it will just see a link to the data, degrading (imo) quite gracefully. I can't decide if the link should be hidden or not in browsers with support though. If the link is hidden then the client should make sure to expose the metadata elsewhere in the interface.

Whilst it does fallback gracefully, I think the method of putting it
in a link is a bit "hack-y" and using the data: URI may pave the way
for other things abusing it.
Also for people that don't have nice link parsing it would look a mess.

I think something like this would be nicer:
```
# Boop, a website :)
Free hugs for all!

^^^
favicon: ?
author: Bob McBobface
last-edited: 22nd Feb 2021
```

That is:
```
<PAGE>
^^^
<METADATA>
```

For the metadata format I think a simple key:value list would work
fine, nothing overcomplicated.
To someone without support for it it should just look like a human
list of metadata.

This way it would work with gemtext's current line-by-line method, and
parsing should be simple.
The delimiter would work similar to the opening ``` toggle and there
would be no closing one, enforcing placing it at the end of the file.
The delimiter needs to be 3 chars long (as per current spec), and
something people wouldn't want to use in their document elsewhere, I
think ^^^ would work good for this.

I think this is given, but the metadata would be entirely optional.

  I'm not sure if "okay" is the right answer, but the MIME type (per the
spec) is defined in RFC-2045 (not RFC-2046 as stated---it's a typo) and
there, a consumer should be able to deal with parameters it doesn't
understand (read: ignore).

> - Should clients be strict and error in case of unknown fields?

  No.  Too hard to maintain strictness when new MIME types and parameters
are added.

  Nothing but parameters.

  Some people don't want web crawlers to crawl their Gemini space.  Web
crawlers can be ... stupidly bad [1].  For me, it's for web proxies that
*DON'T* have a robots.txt preventing web crawlers through the proxy.

  I would say once per "visit" would be good enough (say you have 50
requests to make to a site---check before doing all 50).  Checking
robots.txt for *every* request is a bit too much.  

>  2. Is 'webproxy' a standard reference to any proxy, or is that something

  The guide for Gemini [1] says:

	Below are definitions of various "virtual user agents", each of
	which corresponds to a common category of bot.  Gemini bots should
	respect directives aimed at any virtual user agent which matches
	their activity.  Obviously, it is impossible to come up with perfect
	definitions for these user agents which allow unambiguous
	categorisation of bots.  Bot authors are encouraged to err on the
	side of caution and attempt to follow the "spirit" of this system,
	rather than the "letter".  If a bot meets the definition of multiple
	virtual user agents and is not able to adapt its behaviour in a fine
	grained manner, it should obey the most restrictive set of
	directives arising from the combination of all applicable virtual
	user agents.

	...

	# Web Proxies

	Gemini bots which fetch content in order to translate said content
	into HTML and publicly serve the result over HTTP(S) (in order to
	make Geminispace accessible from within a standard web browser)
	should respect robots.txt directives aimed at a User-agent of
	"webproxy".

  So for example, if you are writing a gopher proxy (user makes a gopher
request to get to a Gemini site), then you might want to check for
"webproxy", even though you aren't actually behind a wesite but a gopher
site.  This is kind of a judgement call.

>  3. Are there globbing-like syntax rules for the Disallow field?

  No.  But it's not a complete literal match either.  

	Disallow:

will allow *all* requests.

	Disallow: /

will not allow any requests at all.

	Disallow: /foo

Will only disallow paths that *start* with the string '/foo', so '/foo',
'/foobar', '/foo/bar/baz/' will all be disallowed.

  Allow: isn't in the standard per se, but many crawlers do accept it.  And
the rules for a user agent are applied in order they're listed.  First match
wins.

  One can go overboard on metadata.  Check out the source on this joker's

I've seen some people put key/value type metadata in their gmi files
already ("tags: this,that,whatevs" for example). Go ahead and do it if
you want; I personally like that you want to put them at the end of
the document, where they won't bother anybody.

As for including it in the spec... I'd rather not. Treat them as
optional extensions :)

Giving my two cents, I agree with Oliver here. I don't think page metadata deserves it's own mime/type and shouldn't be JSON encoded in a data link. Goes against the human-friendly philosophy of Gemtext.

Oliver's proposal seems to be quite right because it makes everything optional, very easy to parse and can also be displayed without any special rendering support by the client. This way it's purely conventional and would still work for clients with and without support.

Regarding color schemes etc. Is it part of the plan that Gemtext pages will control the browser color scheme? Gemtext is a text-based markup, there should be no style information. The user should control the theme of their client/browser, not the page that is currently displayed.

Lagrange is a great example how rendering of Gemtext can be very beautiful without CSS-like styling whatsoever.

I think that metadata are important, I find both easrng's and your
proposal fine. I tend to prefer yours since it degrades better for
people who don't have metadata support in their clients. (On the other
end, easrng's is probably better for programs, while yours is better
for humans, but both work for programs and humans, which I like.)

Now, some details:

* What set of characters in the key (except the colon, of course)?
LDH? ASCII letters or Unicode?

* What about the value? Completely unstructured and therefore
unparsable? Your own example for "last-edited" is useless for programs
since it does not fit any known standard for dates.

* Will we need a list of standard keys, to avoid some people using
"last-modified", others "last-edited" and others "last-change"?

Meta... human-friendly, good...machine readable, better.

MIME headers are very readable on their own. 

A preformatted MIME preamble ?or perhaps even an embedded data:message/rfc822 link? would do nicely.

The spec has "advanced line types" which are treated as optional:

Having the format as part of the spec would be good, I don't think
having an official list of key:values in the spec should be a thing
though, that should be separate.

text/parameters

   The ABNF [RFC5234] grammar for "text/parameters" content is:

   file             = *((parameter / parameter-value) CRLF)
   parameter        = 1*visible-except-colon
   parameter-value  = parameter *WSP ":" value
   visible-except-colon = %x21-39 / %x3B-7E    ; VCHAR - ":"
   value            = *(TEXT-UTF8char / WSP)
   TEXT-UTF8char    = <as defined in Section 20.1>
   WSP              = <See RFC 5234> ; Space or HTAB
   VCHAR            = <See RFC 5234>
   CRLF             = <See RFC 5234>

Some clients show the links, most have an option to display it if they don't.
Myself I like to have them shown so I know where I'm going.

Gemini follows UTF-8/Unicode encoding everywhere else, so sticking to
that makes sense.
A "best practice" will be to stick to regular ASCII characters if possible.

last-edited was just a random example, I wasn't trying to propose keys
or values.

A list of common keys/values should be a thing, without out it the
metadata will be really impractical for any clients to use and will
degrade into meaningless junk.
However this should NOT be a part of the spec, anyone can use any
keys/values they like, but a list of commonly used & recognised by
client should be kept.

OSM has a nice semi-related quote for this:

(tags being key/value pairs)

My question still holds. Should values be unstructured or should we
have structured types (dates, datetimes, numbers, URIs, etc)?

In terms of keys, RFC822 & Co. is not a bad place to start.

+ modernization, i.e. ISO 8601.

Unstructured data wouldn't be much more useful than people just
sticking these in the file as plain text. :P

All the usual standards for dates/numbers/URIs should be followed.

As I said before, a list of common keys/values should be a thing.
Anyone could write any freeform keys/values, but a list of commonly
used & supported key/values should be maintained, this should include
whatever format the values follow.

It should be freeform such that I could come along and decide I want
to use a new key and nothing should break, clients will ignore it if
they don't recognise it.
Metadata is not just for the machines, e.g an `author` key would be
mainly for people interested in who wrote something.

At the moment there's nothing preventing a gemini client from running
an interpreter for a gemtext embedded scripting language other than
good habits and intent. The only thing anyone in the gemini-verse
can do to prevent such things is to not play along. Self-regulation
is all we have.

Maybe it's unfortunate that this truth has been stated with, let's call it
DeVaultian flair, but that doesn't make it wrong or even "intimidation".

I think a returning a 58 error code ("Client is broken and smells bad") on 
requesting favicons would be a more appropriate respons but I can see where 
he's coming from. It's a form of "not playing along" with something he might 
think is very detrimental to the health of the gemini-universe. Drew being
prolific and/or provides resources in the public interest should not be used 
against him.
 
> Think carefully about the consequences of using gemini://srht.site.

It's a bit early for such warning. Gemini is commercially worthless. There
are no big consequences to simply moving a capsule. And if one thinks
gemini will become big and commercially succesful, now is the time to pay 
special interest as to what might turn out to be a slippery slope.

The web didn't get to be in the abysmal state it is in today by a few
bad actors with lots of influence who ruined it for the rest. It's mostly
been well intentioned people thinking "This is probably okay. It's not really
worse than what other-site is already doing". Then copy/paste repeat that
for a couple of decades and you'll arrive at the Jenga tower of crud that
is the current web. The web is a poster child of the slippery slope argument in
action and something the gemini community should be wary of and keep a
keen eye on.

And it is a fun idea, but..

Another fun idea from the web is javascript. In essence it can be a really
convenient way to cross t's and dot i's in the content, and add some fun
creative flourishes. In practice it's turned the web into a network for 
distributing (proprietary) software and burying actual content for 
nefarious purposes.

It's not about what nice conscientious people will do with a fun extention;
it's about how greed and corruption ultimately can co-opt it for their
own purpose.

The best way to prevent going down a slippery slope is to *not step onto the slope*.

I think that for every fun extension it is wise to ask oneself the
question, "Is this creative, or am I re-inventing the web?"

"Favicon" sounds particularly web-ish, especially in light of the two solutions
already brought up ("if the first level 1 title of the homepage starts with a 
unicode character, use that as a favicon" and "generating a colored icon or image
based on the hash of the domain"), which do feel more in line with gemini.

Feel free to disagree with Drew's delivery, but I think it would be best to keep 
any arguments related to current and future gemini.

	cheers,
	Andreas

Bah.

But yes ?while fun? the present Gemini favicon.txt spec "sucks balls" (technical term).

A small tagged data link would achieve just the same, minus overhead:

=> data:text/plain;charset=utf-8,%F0%9F%90%B0 favicon

Subject: [SPEC] Are (simple) commenting systems explicitly unsupported by
 gemini?
Message-ID: <C9G2B1CZSRGG.1L2CHXCPUO8ON@m900382.inf.susx.ac.uk>

Hi,

as I understand it, currently only prompts for single-line inputs are
supported, and it seems this is mostly intended for queries to search
engines. This means, a (anonymous) commenting system could not be
implemented on a gemini page (except for one-line comments).

If multiline input prompts were possible, then you could implement a
commenting system like this: the user would click on a "Click to add
comment" link and then would get a text prompt where she could input a
comment and then submit. (Optionally, the text prompt could be edited in
an external editor.)

I understand that the protocol explicitly doesn't want to implement
complicated mechanisms like POST, but maybe it's possible to escape the
line breaks and submit a multiline input the same way a single-line
input can be submitted right now? (While I'm thinking about this, it
might also be nice to let the server specify a MIME type for the input.)

This system would still be far from the complexity of HTML forms
(essentially it's equivalent to only allowing a single <textarea>), but
might already be quite useful.

Best,
Thomas

Yes, but... there is a hard limit of 1024 bytes per requests, in the specification.

One could always introduce continuation or such, but this is crossing into Rube Goldberg territory.

One way to deal with the 1024 bytes per request limit, would be to submit an URL to the server. Then the server retrieve the content.

Rube Goldberg again.

Nothing prevents an user to submit a multi line replies to a 10/11 input
(UIs aside.)

I just tested this on elpher: `C-q C-j' inserts a newline and it gets
serialised ad %0A (as it should) when building the query.

The 1K limit still applies tho

I had the same limitation when creating DNA (gemini://nixo.xyz), but
managing continuation on the server works quite well.  But I need "user
info" (a certificate) to link different requests together.  This could
also be achieved by using an UUID in the uri.  The server waits for a
specific message ('!save' in my case, but could also be the empty
message) to be inserted in order to know when to save the message.

I agree this is probably a better plan.

Lagrange could take the hue from the theme color and use it, or ignore

I suppose this could be a slippery slope though.

I'm thinking about using text/gemini outside Gemini protocol and would
likely use some form of URNs for links.  There is also a lovely

Hello all,

I have written a Gemini-IPFS gateway[1]. This allows Gemini clients to browse content stored in the IPFS Network[2]. This also means that Gemini capsules can now be hosted on IPFS and take advantage of the properties it has to offer, like not having to rely on a single provider and content-addressing -getting served exactly what you ask for-.

For convenience and demo purposes, I have a deployment at:

gemini://gemini.astyanax.io/

But I of course recommend people to run and customize their own gateway. If you need help, just reach out.
?
Have a nice day!

I don't think any stylistic data should be added.
Metadata should not modify the document in any way, it should only
describe the document or add additional things to it.

>From the spec scrolls:
>  The format is line-oriented, and a satisfactory rendering can be achieved with a single pass of a document, processing each line independently.

Having stylistic info ~kinda (it's possible to argue it doesn't)
breaks this definition.
Enforcing putting the metadata at the end of the file (slightly) helps
to avoid this.

> I suppose this could be a slippery slope though.

Whilst the spec says URLs, people do put URIs such as `mailto:` in
links occasionally, and it's often supported.

Whether it's international or not I don't know.

Message-ID: <C9G69ZQDX46E.2ZAO4YFWY66C4@taiga>

I really don't like this mailing list, because Gemini is lightning in a
bottle and this list is constantly trying to open the bottle. But alas,
here we are again.

I'm sorry for putting the stick on the table upfront; in hindsight it
was rude. I always prefer friendly negotiation first. However: Gemini is
constantly at a dire risk of being extended upon, a pattern which will
ultimately drive it to suffer the fate of the very problems of the web
which motivated its creation in the first place. I like Gemini, and if
we want Gemini to continue being likable, then it cannot grow in this
fashion.

This is not the first time we've dealt with this problem. This mailing
list is a constant stream of pleas for spec additions. Inline styles,
inline images, tables, forms and POST equivalents, the list goes on and
on and on. This mailing list is obsessed with reinventing the web, and
that's NOT what Gemini is for. Solderpunk has been quite clear on this.

The only means we have of regulating this behavior is by making a
statement with our client and server implementations. This is not the
first such statement I've made. First I stated that I would require SNI:

https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/003160.html

This was added to the spec shortly thereafter.

I also made a statement regarding robots.txt:

https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/003506.html

In this case: surprise, portals are just user agents, and blocking them
is blocking users. Dick move.

Most recently, favicons. Contrary to Sean's nasty comments, I am only
making statements on behalf of *my* software, not Gemini as a whole, and
I have every right to. You have every right to make statements on behalf
of your software, too. Clients like Amfora have already done so by
implementing favicons. Mine is a statement of opposition, and we will
ultimately have to come to some kind of consensus. This is how protocol
ecosystems work.

Mozz, your extensions are irresponsible. You view this medium as a
changing, evolving platform, and accept the consequences as it is
fleeting and ultimately doomed to ruin.

Fuck that.

We have a good thing here, and deliberately and recklessly fattening it
is going to screw it up for everyone. Take some responsibility for your
role in making this platform thrive for as long as it can. This
historical revisionism about how Gemini is a platform for Gophers to
feed their creativity into expanding upon Gopher's limitations is
ridiculous.  The purpose of Gemini has always been crystal clear. The
spec has received only minor clarifications and has always come with the
following promises:

- Any changes will not require drastic changes in implementations
- It will be frozen once time has proven it correct

Solderpunk reaffirmed this on the new year.

What you're advocating for is not what Gemini is supposed to be. If you
want that, then fine, go make it in another protocol. Stop trying to
open our lightining bottle. Please.

Finally, to clarify the role of srht.site: I did not intend to issue an
unstated threat of leveraging srht.site's influence to strong-arm Amfora
in this respect. There is not a case of "deliberate timing" here. My
statement regarding the possibility of black holeing was only with
respect to gmnisrv, which is a minority player in the field of Gemini
servers. I don't intend to shove this view onto all users of srht.site -
that's well beyond the scope of appropriate influence. I understand why
this was not clear, and I'm sorry for the confusion.

I cannot read Solderpunk's mind of course, but I strongly suspect the
exclusion is unintentional, because I can't think of anything wrong with
URNs in gemtext.

As Oliver Simmons says, it is already being done. It would be nearly
impossible to keep URNs out anyway: URNs and URLs use the same URI
syntax, so one cannot generally tell whether a URI is a URN or a URL
without understanding the scheme.

I guess it should maybe be changed to say "URI" in the spec.

This was my opinion of the favicons situation ? that you (Drew) were
correct in substance, but wrong in form. It would have been much better
to raise the issue on the mailing list, with your arguments against the
favicon convention up-front.

I agree, but I feel it would be better to work towards that consensus in
a more collegial manner.

I'm going to speak in Mozz's defense here, even though I think that at
this point the favicons convention experiment should be abandoned by
clients. Two things: first, the favicons convention is wrong, but it's
not *obviously* wrong, because it doesn't affect the protocol, the
gemtext format, or otherwise cause any backward compatibility issues.
Secondly, when Mozz introduced the favicon convention, Gemini was in a
much greater state of flux, and the community more experimental than it
is today. Mozz wrote it up as a concrete proposal on the mailing list,
implemented it on portal.mozz.us, and went from there. I suggest that
they did nothing wrong in that context, and proceeded exactly as they
should have.

With hindsight, the "one resource, one request" principle looks more
important with regard to privacy than it did at that time, and that's
why I'd recommend dropping support for favicons. But implementing
favicons at that time wasn't a mistake ? it was an experiment.

I understand that Solderpunk is extremely busy, but I do think that the
mailing list is suffering in his relative absence; a limitation of the
BDFN (benevolent dictator for now) structure we currently have.

Thank you for this; this does a tremendous amount to de-escalate the

I am very new to the game (this is my first mail in this mailing list) and
I never really participated in any "protocol ecosystems" in making.
Nevertheless, is there not a risk in that game that's
the most popular implementation defines the rule and hence, the game
is not being right, but being popular?

That is very nice to clarify that. But it still raises the concern of
such risk in
future by an actor of similar size: will the stick not overcome any
rational debate?

Also, unrelated, but I have learnt a lot from this mailing list through these
different debates and I think I start to have a better idea now of
Gemini's philosophy
thanks to you all (and I'm sure many of my first intuitions would have
first been
considered as anti-pattern / recreating the web)?
This learning has been very organic, almost chaotic and only thanks to
the people
posting "wrong" initiatives here as the answer they receive served for me as
guidelines as "Gemini philosophy".
Is there anywhere a more structured document, the equivalent of "unix
philosophy"
but for Gemini that would express the intention behind some of the
"limitation"/restrictions
of the platform that a newbie like me could refer to instead of
learning "by chance"
this through some response here and there (and sorry if it is an obvious link
that I am not aware about) ?

Yes, that's a risk indeed. I think it's a well-managed risk in Gemini
right now, we have a huge selection of client and server softwares to
choose from and no single actor has a dominant role. And unlike web
browsers, new Gemini software can be written and useful in the span of a
weekend, providing an easy escape hatch - but this will change if we're
not strict in limiting the scope of the protocol.

I do realize that srht.site has the potential to become sizable enough
to carry substantial influence on the direction of Gemini. However, I
don't want it to do so: srht.site should only be a boon to the
community, not a risk or a political tool. I pledge to not use it as a
platform for pushing any opinionated decisions which are not already
representative of the community consensus.

I can't say this for the next service that comes along, but hopefully it
helps to set the tone.

The FAQ helps a lot:

gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/faq.gmi

But I think a lot of people don't read it, or perhaps forget about it,
because many of the proposals oft floated are clearly not in the spirit
of Gemini as laid down by the upstream documentation.

This is kind of what happened to the HTTP/HTML web, with big
corporations such as Google taking over.
Mozilla/Firefox was created for the purpose of stopping Microsoft
taking over the web when they were a big player.

403 Forbidden is ideal for this, or one of the 50x error codes. In practice most systems will retry a 50x request but not a 403.

409 conflict implies you are updating some resource a d this is rejected because of a conflicting request already being handled by the server. Not appropriate to this case as we are not updating.

451 is explicitly for legal reasons. Not semantic nor preference but book burning lawyer talk. Also not appropriate.

Using uncommon http codes makes things more confusing than necessary.

Opinions, opinions.

Quoting Tim Bray:

   HTTP/1.1 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons
   Link: <https://spqr.example.org/legislatione>; rel="blocked-by"
   Content-Type: text/html

   <html>
    <head><title>Unavailable For Legal Reasons</title></head>
    <body>
     <h1>Unavailable For Legal Reasons</h1>
     <p>This request may not be serviced in the Roman Province
     of Judea due to the Lex Julia Majestatis, which disallows
     access to resources hosted on servers deemed to be
     operated by the People's Front of Judea.</p>
    </body>
   </html>

Seems appropriate.

In another project, I like to describe myself as Chief Cook and

about it helps to defuse anyone's fear (including mine) that I will aspire
to be the Absolute Dictator of the Known Universe.  ("But I could do so

Lesson to be learned, perhaps: when an actor in a position of power (real,
potential, or even just perceived) issues a moderate threat, other actors
may read it as an existential threat, and so eventually provoke the Second
Coming (of Jesus or the Valar or both, it's going to be a rough ride in any
case).  So the bigger you are, the meeker you should be; after all, the
meek will inherit the earth, bit by bit, pushing back against violence.

No no no.  It may sound silly today, but violating a law like that would
get your servers raided -- and by raided I mean that a decurio and his
squad would be sent to destroy them, capture anyone they could find, bring
the captives before a magistrate for an exceedingly speedy trial without
jury or lawyers, and then behead them (if citizens) or crucify them (if
non-citizens or slaves).  That's what you got for laesum maiestatum (or
l?se-majest?, as they say in Gaul).

Don't abuse the CCCCLI response.

Message-ID: <4B4C9ED9-3998-47CD-ABD0-F0A499729B86@gerwitz.com>

I?m a bit afraid to open the lightning-bottle of this list, but feel compelled to bring my design day job to my geek hobbies. So, let me step onto the metaphorical slope with my three wishes for the UX of Geminispace:

## Capsule branding

It?s important for users to experience a sense of place as they navigate (as per Luke Emmet?s ?cognitive aspects? thread from May 2020) but also important to give content creators some control over the presentation of their text.

Already we see extensive use of ASCII art. This is retro-cool but I would argue favicons or theme colors are actually *more* minimal, and also more attractive to 21st century users.

Personally, I would be happy if this was hostname-level metadata. But I don?t feel strongly enough about this to argue over favicon.txt. ;-)

## Line orientation

The spec is already clear about this but let me add a new rationale: the line-by-line orientation of gemtext is a huge strength. It will enable a vibrant ecosystem of clients and also UI models: I?m experimenting with a few ideas that simply wouldn?t work with HTML.

Thus, I hope to see no more additions with modes like preformatting. This means I would twist Oliver Simmons?s proposal for appended metadata to something more like:

^^^ author: Hans Gerwitz
^^^ color: #00FF00 

## Inline images

I appreciate the need to avoid spurious network requests, especially across servers. But rules like ?user takes action? are impossible to enforce (and scrolling is an action). I?d like to recognize the inevitability of inline media display and specify some clear rules before we end up with unpredictable behaviors across clients.

E.g. clients MAY fetch linked content for inline rendering IF the link URL points to the same server (no scheme or hostname). Clients MUST allow users to disable this auto-fetching. Clients MUST NOT fetch content of unrecognized type. [Unaddressed: how to recognize type? Mime type parameter? ?File extensions? on the URL?]

Thanks for reading!

Hello Geminauts,

I have made my decision regarding favicon support in Amfora. They are currently
opt-in, and now they will be removed.

https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora/issues/199#issuecomment-783645893

I had no idea they would be so controversial, and I am glad to put this piece of
drama behind me. They were a fun experiment, but ultimately I cannot justify
them. Some would say I don't need to, but I would like to.


I will be changing makeworld.space's favicon to U+1F6AB NO ENTRY SIGN: ?
Feel free to do the same, or not. Enjoy Gemini, and go outside once in a while
too :)


Cheers,
makeworld

I think that the lack of aesthetic branding is one of the best parts of 
the Gemini space. Capsules should be distinguished by content, not 
appearance. Presentation should be up to the user-agent, not the 
authors. If branding is important for a site, then the Web is probably a 
better fit for it than Gemini or Gopher.

Actions equivalent to navigation should work. When navigating to a link 
pointing to an image, displaying that image inline should suffice.

Scrolling isn't sufficient because users can't see what's "below the 
fold" and therefore can't consent to sending a network request to an 
unknown resource. This could also be used for tracking; authors could 
"measure" how far a reader as scrolled by seeing which images got 
loaded.

Inline images should only be used if they're a necessary part of the 
content and alt-text won't suffice. Readers should be able to decide if 
this is the case from the context and make a decision; the decision 
should not be made by authors.

Why?

Are you not depriving your very own users from a fun, harmless functionality in the name of some misplaced ideological purity?

This looks like bullying. And the terrorists win. Again.

Disappointing.

While this quote is far enough from the main thrust of Michael?s point to be considered a grossly misleading out-of-context quote, I want to agree with it in parts.

Restrictions on Gemini (the protocol and gemtext) make it easy to have lots of Gemini clients that are all capable of browsing _all_ of Geminispace and not just the simpler ones. This is in _stark_ contrast to HTTP-land, where if you want to browse all of the Web you need to use one of 2.5 browser engines. I think having lots of good clients for all the popular platforms (and many of the unpopular ones!) is a goal worth preserving, even though I have a bunch of good clients for all the platforms I?m ever likely to use (and I?m exceedingly unlikely to write one of my own).

Because Gemini complexity and browser diversity are fundamentally at odds with each other, and the Web already chose complexity at the cost of diversity, I?ve become much more against protocol/gemtext additions. I thought the favemoji thing was cool when I first heard about it, but since it?s something of a camel?s nose in the tent, I changed my Amfora settings back to not requesting them.

Firstly, "[when the] user takes [an] action" is a misrepresentation of
the consensus about making additional network connections, which I'd
summarise instead as "when the user explicitly requests that specific
additional network connection".

Secondly, this is currently not a 'rule' - the actual rule in the spec
(?5.4.2) is:
> however clients MUST NOT automatically make any network connections 
> as part of displaying links whose scheme corresponds to a network 
> protocol
...which is technically much more permissive. However, the intent
behind this rule is clearly to improve privacy and reduce waste of
bandwidth, so the practical interpretation of the rule is a lot stricter
than just the "not automatically" in the spec. The 'rules' in
Geminispace are not just determined by the spec, but also by the culture
around Gemini, and they not "enforced" by some official authority, but
rather through interactions between people. That alone means that
auto-fetching inline media is clearly not "inevitable".

In general, it makes for unpleasant discussion when you assert something
without sufficient reasoning as a /fait accompli/, as an "inevitability"
that you are just "recognising".

Looking at the linked github issue. It seemed like the person that
created it wasn't very interested in anything other than "do what I
want" or else the sites will be blacklisted.

Sometimes I think that ideologies are important, especially since many
of these niche communities are based around such ideas like
minimalism. But then other times, the ideologies are used as
weapons... which is not constructive?

I am just new to the gemini community (first time posting here). So
hopefully my thoughts aren't too out of context!

Thanks,

Please disregard this part of my message! It was placed in the wrong
place. I was trying to agree with the comment that this seems like
bullying.

But also, reading the github issue, the owner of the repo does say
that's not what it is.

It is bullying and he is toxic to every community he is a part of. I was disappointed to see him join Gemini discussions and try to strong arm out the spirit of exploration and experimentation.

Message-ID: <20210222215629.eve2rmqsiau5m6sx@grumpy.local>

Hello!

This is my first post on this mailinglist and I want to introduce some
services and a Gemini Server for the ESP8266 microcontroller.

At first I want to announce my Gemini Hosting Site, where whoever wants
to can have his own capsule in the form of rawnix.org/~username/ .
There are also furher plans, which I follow when there's demand.

gemini://rawnix.org/

The second announcement is about a Gemini Server for the ESP8266
microcontroller I'm tinkering around with. It's hosted on Bitbucket, so
the link to the sourcecode is:

https://bitbucket.org/-fab-/esp8266-gemserver

And as a personal introduction my home capsule:

gemini://rawnix.org/~fab/

There's not much on it yet but I hope there will be organic growth over
time.

I haven't set up a webserver for this domain yet, but I've planned to
only link to the gemini content on it.

Maybe this isn't too deep a rabbit hole

as per gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/gemtext.gmi that states:

should not be, but which source code perhaps should be).  There are
currently no established conventions on how alt text should be

Hmmm.. I used a ED25519 cert. Maybe that is a problem. I changed to a
rsa cert now. Should work for everybody.

Hi makeworld

In my opinion you made a fatal mistake and set a dangerous precedent in giving in to the pressure of a single Gemini user. 

Favicons are neither part of the Gemini Spec nor do they contradict it. That is a fact for all who can read. Unfortunately, false information and misinterpretations of "the spirit of the spec" are thrown around here, so my hair stands on end.

A specification should not determine what content can be transmitted and displayed. And it doesn't. We're talking about a single text/plain resource with a single (!) UTF-8 character and emotions go high as to whether it should be allowed for client developers to implement the special display of such a file or not. 

It is the task of the Gemini specification to protect against undesirable developments and it already does that very well.

You are a developer who has invested hundreds of hours or probably more and you have greatly enriched the Gemini community. You shouldn't degrade your work that way. You have a proven track record. Amfora is everywhere and so many users love it for a reason.

It makes me deeply sad that cancel culture has found its way into Gemini so quickly. It makes me even sadder that that leading contributors in the Gemini community are verbally attacked and then give in to pressure from individuals who are not officially affiliated with Gemini (if there is still such a thing anyway) whatsoever.

It is not the favicon that is against "the spirit of Gemini". It's the way this was dealt with.
 
It's a shame that Solderpunk doesn't seem to have the time to give this community one or two clues as to what his thoughts are. All of this provides a foretaste of what is likely to come in the future.

Will Gemini become a club for a small self-proclaimed elite who see it as their personal hobby to bully and pressure developers and/or content providers instead of making the fruits of all the work of many volunteers available to everyone and embrace or at least allow for some room of experimentation.

I think you have mischaracterized my decision here. Obviously Drew's threat
colours all of this, but I made the choice myself, after reading dozens of
messages on the mailing list and elsewhere. Drew blackholing his capsule is not
a significant threat to me, and could easily be circumvented.

I appreciate the compliments, and hope to continue to "enrich the Gemini
community" as you kindly put it.

Hello

This is not an either-or as I see it. We can have both a sense of place 
to assist navigation and memory AND at the same time avoid server side 
branding and attempts at aesthetic control.

My investigations in this direction led me to implement auto-theming in 
the client. The server has to specify nothing, but the client creates an 
automatic theme based on the site identity derived from the URL. For 
details see the auto "fabric" theme for GemiNaut client:

gemini://gemini.marmaladefoo.com/geminaut/

To my mind this is sufficient to demonstrate that there is no need for 
any server controlled colours, fonts, favicons or the like - and at the 
same time we can build attractive UI experiences for the end user that 
are content-focussed and can assist the user in finding their way around.

Thank you Stephane for adding more fine grained info about the 
text/gemini subset of resources. I think these statistics are helpful in 
understanding the broad shape of the geminiverse.

Yes we all need to get out more - it seems Solderpunk has discovered the 
benefits of this.

I think it is a shame this experiment has generated so much agitation. 
It is not any kind of violation of the gemini spec. While we are talking 
about slippery slopes, policing for "authenticity" or violations of "the 
gemini way" is a slippery slope takes us into a rather dark space in my 
view.

Whilst it may seem attractive to attempt to turn a technical 
specification into a political manifesto, these aspects should be 
separated into the technical spec which is about interoperability, and a 
FAQ or motivation document that lays out broader objectives and the 
underlying perspective that the spec seeks to support.

If you still like the idea of site based icons to assist with 
bookmarking and the like, why not investigate "auto theming" and have 
amfora select a persistent emoji itself based on the URL.

It was thus said that the Great Drew DeVault once stated:

> ridiculous.  

  Michael is correct---you are not.  Gemini *is* an expansion of gopher, not
a reimagining of the web.  Citing primary sources here (Solderpunk himself):

gopher://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/0/~solderpunk/phlog/pondering-whats-inbetween-gopher-and-the-web.txt

	It's no secret, of course, that I love gopher.  Some of my reasons
	are outlined in previous writings[2].  And it's neither a secret
	that I hate the web, or at least it's modern incarnation.  Both of
	these things can be, and are, true while I still believe that Gopher
	is not perfect and has shortcomings, and there are things about the
	web experience to miss when one surfs on port 70.  So lately I've
	been thinking about "the space inbetween", about hypothetical dream
	protocols which are more than gopher but less than HTTP.

	...

	As a first contribution to this line of thinking, I have come up
	with a protocol which basically consists of three small changes to
	gopher which address what I *think* I currently believe are its
	three greatest shortcomings.

	The first change is that TLS encryption of all connections is
	mandatory.  No two port cleartext/cyphertext distinction like HTTP
	and HTTPS, no upgrade from cleartext using STARTTLS, just secure
	connections from the get go and that's it. ...

	The second change is that the standard non-directory item type is
	not a plaintext file, but a text file in some very lightweight,
	human-readable markup language which supports inline linking to
	other resources.  ...

	The third and final change is the introduction of an item-type which
	means "interpret this selector and interact with it in some way
	determined by its schema".  The 'h' item-type already plays this
	role for many more advanced clients, if you put a "URL:" in front of
	the selector, but this is IMHO an ugly hack which really spoils the
	clean semantics of the gopher protocol.  And item-type of 'h' is
	supposed to and *should* mean "this is a HTML file", and item-types
	shouldn't do double duty as it defeats the point of them.

gopher://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/0/~solderpunk/phlog/why-gopher-needs-crypto.txt

	I'm talking about the fact that my hypothetical new protocol
	operated strictly over TLS connections - plaintext straight up
	wasn't an option.  I am of the opinion that the widespread lack of
	encryption in gopherspace today is the protocol's biggest
	shortcoming, and I actually suspect that this point alone
	discourages some folks who would otherwise be on board from adopting
	it.  But others, including Bongusta overlord Logout, do not see the
	need, so here's my attempt at a justification.

	...

	The web is surely a dumpster fire, but let's not pretend gopher is
	perfect and cannot be improved.  Those of us fleeing the web have
	just fallen back here because it's about the only off-the-shelf
	vaguely web-like thing that there is to fall back to.  Some of us
	may be truly comfy here, and that's absolutely fine.  Increasingly I
	think I'd like to use gopher as a temporary base of operations to
	build something even better.

gopher://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/0/~solderpunk/phlog/more-on-gopher-and-crypto.txt

	My recent post[1] about "why gopher needs crypto" received a very
	well-considered response[2] over at The Boston Diaries.  The author
	(do I call you "the conman"?) rightly points out that the true
	challenge is not in actually conducting a gopher request/response
	transaction over a TLS connection, which in relatively trivial and
	has been done before.  Rather, the core difficulty lies in the
	absence of any way to represent in a type-1 response that a
	particular gopher resource is accessible via TLS.

	...

	The conman suggests that creating a new protocol is to risk that we
	"start falling into HTTP territory".  This is of course a very real
	risk, but I also very strongly believe that it is perfectly
	avoidable if we are sufficiently determined from day one to avoid
	it.  To this end, I hope to think and write (and read, if anybody
	wants to join in!) more in the future not just about the
	shortcomings of gopher but very explicitly about what is right and
	what is wrong about HTTP and HTML.  It's vitally important to
	identify precisely what features of the web stack facilitated the
	current state of affairs if we want to avoid the same thing
	happening again.

gopher://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/0/~solderpunk/phlog/the-soul-of-gopher.txt

	What is the "true spirit of gopher"?  Its "heart and soul", the
	deep, conceptual commitment which distinguishes it from other
	protocols, in particular from the web?

	...

	Now that we've uncovered the true spirit of gopher, the natural
	question, for those participating in the on-going discussions about
	new gopher-inspired protocols, is whether or not this idea is one
	that the gopher community really cherishes and which should be
	preserved in the Ultimate New Protocol of Truth and Glory.

	...

	... There's plenty of evidence out there that a lot of Gopher
	enthusiasts don't actually *want* a protocol that divides sharply
	between navigation and content.  They just want to be able to serve
	plain-text with hyperlinks anywhere they like, via a bare bones
	protocol that doesn't support tracking and other unpleasantries. 
	Something like "HTML with only the <a href> tag, over HTTP/0.1".  I
	think that's all *I* want.

gopher://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/0/~solderpunk/phlog/protocol-pondering-intensifies-ii.txt

	In the previous post in this series[1] I compared request formats
	for gopher and HTTP and thought a bit about what a good anonymous
	document system actually needs.  I ended up deciding that the answer
	was nothing more than gopher already provides.  In this post I'll
	continue that discussion, focussing instead on the response format.

	...

	This protocol is not as simple as gopher, but I would argue its
	power to weight ratio is substantially greater.  ...

gopher://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/0/~solderpunk/phlog/protocol-pondering-intensifies-iii.txt


	A standard gopher menu line looks like this:

	...

	An obvious update which could be made here is to take advantage of
	the fact that between now and gopher was first invented, URLs have
	been invented!  We don't need to specify the selector (path), host
	and port separately, we have a standard way to build that into one
	string, and every modern programming language has libraries for
	parsing/buiding them. ...

gopher://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/0/~solderpunk/gemini/cold-blanketry.txt

	The Gemini project has attracted more attention in a short time
	frame than I expected, and on the whole the project is moving very
	fast!  It's quickly becoming apparent that not everybody is going to
	agree with everybody else about what the best path forward for the
	project is.  If things keep moving this fast, it's going to be very
	hard to keep building and maintaining consensus among the entire
	community.

	I understand that this seems kind of sad and kind of scary, but I
	think (and surely hope!) that it will be okay.

	The worst case scenario as I see it is that the Gemini project
	quickly descends into internal arguments, nobody can agree on
	anything and the whole thing fizzles out in a week.  If that
	happens, we've all still got gopher, which isn't going anywhere. ...

  If you have a rebuttle, fine, but "citation needed."

  Yes, a new gopher.  Ahd simplicity of implementation for both client and
server.

> The
> spec has received only minor clarifications and has always come with the
> following promises:

  No.  The spec has received *major* changes and clarifications since it was
first written.  I've mentioned in other messages the differences from then
and now.  But saying it has only ever had "minor clarifications" is history
revisionism.

  Upon reflection, I misspoke here.  Not a new gopher, but a new protocol
with a gopher feel.  It's not meant to replace gopher (nor the web).

Subject: Supporting multi-line input without changing the specification
Message-ID: <CAObwWNgBv68jwoGFwgatPcFmeLVD3tkMBKZg2iS-Rv=2-S=AQA@mail.gmail.com>

Since we're still getting proposals, I'm writing something I read somewhere
gemini related. I do not claim I invented this myself. (Except the codes at
the bottom.)

# Objective

Provide a way for users to send bigger chunks of text to the server.

# User experience

Support for regular status 10 input, CGI and client certificates assumed.

## Clients with multi-line support

The reader klicks a link. A text box, with a label from the meta part,
appears. The reader writes and sends the message.

## Clients without multi-line support

The reader klicks a link. An input field, with a label from the meta
part, appears.
The reader writes the first line, end the line with a marker character to
signal a wish to continue and sends the request. The server responds with a
new input until it doesn?t receive that marker character.

It should be easier to exit the loop than to continue.

## Servers

The writer puts a script (or a symlink to a script) in a reasonable
location and link to it in gemtext. The script handles the incoming texts.

# Behind the scenes

The server needs to indicate to the client that it expects a multi-line
text. One way is to send a new 1x status, like 12, but that is a spec
change. Other ways are to use a specific file name extension or a keyword
in the meta field.

I must admit I prefer the new status code over the others. Other options?

The client needs to indicate to the server that it wants to continue the
text in another request. I have chosen & since it doesn't need to be
escaped and doesn't have a specific meaning yet in gemini.

## Example

S: "10 New guest book entry (multi)\r\n"
C: "gemini://guestbook.example/new.multi?Neat%20that%20you%20can%20post%20
multi-line%20texts.&n\r\n"
S: "10 (more)\r\n"
C: "gemini://guestbook.example/new.multi?I%20wonder%20if%20clients%20will%20
adopt%20it.\r\n"

## Codes

I have written a script to experiment with user experience. These are the
codes I came up with:

* Input lines ending with "&n" indicates that the next request is a new
line.
* Input lines ending with just "&" indicates that the line continues
immediately in the next request. (Can be in the middle of a word.)
* Input lines ending with "&p" saves a round-trip when you want to insert a
blank line.
* Everything else indicates that it is the final line.

These codes are made to be typed by a human. A client translating a text
box could just put "%0a" to break a line and end the input with a "&" when
it reaches the maximum request length to continue in the next request.

There's no doubt that Gemini draws inspiration from Gopher, but that's
not the matter at hand. I'm not going to rebuke your sources because
this question is not disputed.

The real question is whether not Gemini is or has ever been a playground
for Gophers to innovate on their hot new ideas in, and it most certainly
is not. Solderpunk has gone on record many, many times as disfavoring
extensibility. While the specification was under development, sure, it
changed quite a lot, but it has not undergone any major changes for some
time now. With his stance on non-extensibility, the lack of major
changes in well over a year, alongside statements like this in the
spec's introduction:

> Although not finalised yet, further changes to the specification are
> likely to be relatively small. You can write code to this
> pseudo-specification and be confident that it probably won't become
> totally non-functional due to massive changes next week, but you are

It's pretty reasonable to assume that Gemini has entered its end-game
and it's not open to further innovations or experiments. Stating that it
is or has been is the historical revisionism to which I am referring.
Gemini has been quite obviously approaching its "done" stages for well
over a year.

If you don't agree, go ask Solderpunk yourself. He doesn't seem to enjoy
talking to this community anymore, though, for reasons quite apparent to
me.

Thanks for experimenting!

I'll drop the code from my client that was exploring this - seems like a
good conclusion.

On to the next experiment!

Thanks for experimenting!

I feel that by analogy, status code 418 might be appropriate.

If you want control over the presentation of your text, serve a PDF. The
uniformity of Gemini pages is a feature. The way Lagrange and Geminaut
auto-style pages is a good way of providing a sense of place without
giving the author another lever to abuse.

Note that loading images on scrolling allows a particularly nasty kind
of behavioral tracking ? you can know how far the user scrolled down the
page, and how long it took them to get to that point.

I do think that "display inline, on click" is a reasonable behavior in a
graphical browser, though I personally would rather images load in a
dedicated image viewing tool.

Someone built a wiki for use over gemini. It has its own side-protocol for
editing but I don't remember the names.

Lagrange does this too: it chooses a Unicode character and a color when you
load a document from a new host, and remembers it.

And in the upcoming v1.2, you get to change the icon to whatever character you want via the GUI. There is a simple input field that accepts a single character.

=> https://github.com/skyjake/lagrange/issues/140#issuecomment-783864956

Adventurous users might even write a script that goes through the bookmarks.txt file and attempts to fetch the favicon.txt of each bookmark, if that is something one finds useful. I don't currently have plans to implement automated or manual fetching of these via the app.

As I mention in the linked comment, IMO the user should ultimately be in control of bookmark (site) icons so that they can be used to convey a personal meaning. Unicode characters / Emoji can be open to interpretation; when selecting the set of random icons that Lagrange uses I tried to keep them somewhat neutral, with varying levels of success.

My longer term plan is to allow further customization for site theming, including setting per-site color themes.

It depends largely on the site/application.  Some will render everything
that looks like an url as such, so for example foo://example.com gets
highlighted, other have an hardcoded list of supported protocols, see
for instance this PR for mastodon[0].

Cheers,

P.S. Speaking of such, I'll be grateful if someone knows how to mark
gemini links inside mu4e (in mu4e-view-mode.)

While the historical debate is very interesting (I wasn't there, and I
love to learn about how things became what they are), it does not help
a lot with current discussions such as "should we extend Gemini with
this or that?" I guess (just a guess: no social scientist made a
serious survey of geminists yet) that most geminauts today never used
Gopher and even do not know about it. They want something better than
the Web for some usages and they do not refer to an old protocol.

Gemini faces a strategic issue: is it a system for a few Gopher
nostalgics or is it something that may be presented and promoted to a
wider audience? (No, I don't target "world domination".)

Simplicity and non-extensibility are core tenets of Gemini so I think
we all agree it is important to keep this target in sight. But I do
not think it means to reject everything without even considering
it. This would be a simple course of action, but it may deprive us of
useful things, and may hamper Gemini's adoption. I think we should
rather consider each proposal for its merits (and problems), keeping
in mind the criteria (which are sometimes non-explicit: for instance
the "only one network request" rule recently proposed by Solene was
not explicit in the specification).

Using as an example two recent discussions (favicons and metadata),
instead of dismissing them immediately, we could consider:

* do they add to the network budget (favicons do)?
* do they facilitate fingerprinting (favicons do, metadada don't)?
* is there a risk they add a pressure on non-willing clients to
  support them (CSS would do: a Web client without CSS is not very
  useful, while a Web client without favicon support is certainly not
  a problem for user adoption)?
* what level of complexity do they add (none in non-willing clients,
  for favicons and metadata, very little for those who adopt it)?
* do they degrade gracefully for non-willing clients (both proposals
  do)?

Therefore, discussions on this list about new proposals are
reasonable, IMHO.

I will not comment on personal issues (like most of us, I don't know
why he is now silent) but this is a problem for Gemini. The Benevolent
Dictator model has a lot of strengths (fast decision, consistency, no
bureaucracy and processes, ability to keep focused on a tough goal,
etc) but it requires the BD to act. If the BD is absent or silent,
this model turns into the Nobody In Charge, which is really bad,
because it does not allow to decide on touchy issues.

The good point is that it already exists so we don't reinvent the

complicated. For instance, dates are expressed in the ISO 8601 format
which is 1) not publically available 2) very complicated (unlike what

Using this "alt text" feature is tempting, and it allows the metadata
proposal to avoid any change in the specification. But, currently, as
far as I know, there is no registry of possible alt texts. (I don't
ask for an official registry in the spec. Any widely recognized
registry will do.)

For dates, purl is even worse, allowing many format of dates, besides
the complicated ISO 8601. Laxity is bad for simplicity.

Most of your messages are useless but calling someone who just barked

Whatever one think of the favicon proposal, and of the flamewar

Greetings,

Some of this depends on what kind of metadata we are talking about.

I am reluctant to discuss extension.  I would have to say that the only
 topic of potential interest to me [1] in that area would be about
document metadata: Gemini is about transmission of information and
metadata is information.  By document metadata I mean information
/about/ the document content.

As for the questions of network budget, fingerprinting, pressure to
include, and complexity[2], those can be addressed.

If the document metadata is in the body of the document, then there are
no extra network requests.  That addresses fingerprinting and mostly
addresses network budget.

The metadata does not have to be marked up in a difficult manner to be
both machine readable and human readable.  Borrowing from the link
syntax [3],

=:[<whitespace>]<TERM><whitespace><METADATA>

which could look like this in the body, but would be up to the client as
to how it is dealt with.  Left unprocessed, it would degrade gracefully
and be quite readable.

=:	dc.title	A Random Title
=:	dc.date 	2021-02-23
=:	keywords	cat; dog; bird

Again, by being included anywhere inside the body, there would be no
extra network calls.

There should be no requirement as to what is in the metadata, which
terms are allowed, or what the terms mean.  Any extension should say
only how terms may be included and leave the rest up to the capsule and
the client software.  Otherwise the details would lead to discussions
which would last years [4] at best while also reinventing the wheel.

If a tipping point is ever reached regarding use then there might be
some pressure for clients to support it.  But if the trajectory follows
that of HTML metadata, its use will be inconsistent, niche, and
site-specific.

Anyway, the type(s) of metadata would be up to the capsule owner to pick
and for them follow a schema or vocabulary or not.

All that said, there is usually more to gain by KISS than by extension
or creeping featurism.

[1] I (a retired digital libraries specialist) got into setting up a
Gemini capsule only two weeks ago but used to run a gopher site both
back when it was relevant and in more recent years as an Onion service.
 As for the WWW, I did not get into running any Web sites until 1994,
the second of which was briefly so visited by the end of that year that
it caused a local network outage.

This assumes, of course, that Gemini isn?t fine the way it is.

I only used Gopher a tiny bit back when it was a contender, but every time I?ve looked at running a Gopher anything I?ve run away in disgust and fear from the hard-wrapped 80-column lines with the leftmost column taken up by line-type directives. I wouldn?t even know _how_ to write pages like that without going bonkers. Gemini, meanwhile, is _very_ familiar to someone who?s written HTML and Markdown: Write text files, upload via scp.

Sneering at Gopher fans isn?t particularly helpful here.

You?re only looking at the current metadata proposals, though, and not extrapolating out what sort of extensibility metadata brings. Once some capsules start using metadata that?s only usable in some clients, those capsules will have an implicit Best Viewed In Gemini Client X label stuck to them. The Best Viewed In Browser X era of the Web is _not_ something I want replicated in Gemini.

Because I?m already strongly in favor of making it easy to make a good Gemini client, I?m against proposals that could, down the line, increase the amount of work that it?d take to make a good, full-featured Gemini client. Arbitrary-metadata proposals are a fully general can of worms that, say, double-digit status codes aren?t.

That might be "twinwiki"

https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/002078.html
gemini://webgate.geminet.org/web.sh?https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/002078.html

Twinwiki uses sed commands to edit, which I found quite clever and elegant. I think the
trick to making it more approachable is to have a client that allows for normal edits but 
translates those into sed commands when updating the page (diff -e ?).

I don't think BDFL is a single role and it depends on the nature of the 
project. If you compare a spec's BD to a BD for a large project with lots 
of churn (Linus) or a programming language (Guido), it might seem slow, but
I'm unsure if such different projects can be directly compared.

How Gemini's BD tends to chime in after pondering and waiting for moods to 
settle, and then  explain his process of thought in a clear, calm way that makes 
any camps in a disagreement feel like they've been heard is quite exceptional.

I think "Let's rebuild the web, but better!" is a common last refrain
of parties that involve alcohol and have hackers present. Gemini
is an outlier here in that it actually seems to be happening.

In short, I don't think absence or silence is really a negative 
in these situations, and should be seen more as a sign of deliberation 
than negligence.

These kinds of suggestions are along the line of having a client that
supports translating *asterisks* to emphasis, translating <font
family="foo"> to a specific font family, and so on.

There's nothing stopping anyone from implementing that kind of thing at
any moment and if it's gets traction it'll get traction. We're in a
similar situation as what broke the pre-standards web.

There's not a lot me or anyone else can do about that so I don't worry
too much about it??

However, for sending text I recommend email.

Here's an idea for how a wiki in a world where spam didn't exist could
work:

You send email to an address. The text of the page at the path that
matches the subject of that email is then set to the body of the email.

Whether that subject is "nice/orderly/unixy/path" or "Completely bonkers
with spaces that'll need to get percent-encoded and trunced to match the
1024 limit."

If people want to edit they can paste the old text into their new email.

This is just from the top of my head and not something I'd put into
production any time soon.

PS not to say that it's a clear cut case.

I generally do think the sed command idea is clever and that it's generally
fine if clients do convenience things, like av98's tour mode.
Aww, foiled once more by Turing and his cursed completeness!

there is nothing preventing users to publish markdown files instead
of gemini files. On gemini, it's not mandatory to have everything as 
gemtext which would be reducing Gemini potential.

Like it is often done in gopher, people can have gemtext files as menus 
with their texts files in markdown that could be opened with a nice 
markdown viewer program, and links with gemini:// scheme from the 
markdown file would be opened using the gemini client. That would be 
like using opening a PDF from a website and clicking on a link in the PDF :)

The workflow may not seem optimal but it's perfectly doable with the 
current state of the protocol.

Alt text is for accessibility, not metadata.

Only data about the document should be allowed, and it should not
modify the document (i.e. no stylistic info).

This syntax would allow for it to be placed anywhere in the document,
which could enable it to be used to extend Gemini in unwanted ways,
for example:

=:    text-colour    red
I'm blue!
=:    text-colour    blue
I'm red >:)
(this is a lame example, there are probably worse things it could do)

Placing it at the end of the file, which my format would enforce,
makes this impossible.
If it did change the file (which wouldn't be allowed) it would have to
be the entire file, making this harder.

Also, using space as the delimiter causes some issues, for example:
=: author Oliver Simmons
A simple client might try to split on the spaces, which would split
the name into two, using a colon or equals is more conventional for
key/value things, and avoid this problem (wanting to use : or = in a
key or value isn't likely).

Just pointing out that none of the three proposed formats do this,
extension of the protocol is entirely out of the question.
This is NOT like HTTP headers, it is strictly document metadata.

Yup!
Alt text itself is a form of metadata, but that doesn't mean it's ok
to include other metadata inside it.
Someone with a screen reader wouldn't want to have that read out to them.
In Gemini it's intended to be used for things such as code or ASCII
art to describe what they are.

The spec says this about alt text:
>  Alt text is recommended for ASCII art or similar non-textual content which, for example, cannot be meaningfully understood when rendered through a screen reader or usefully indexed by a search engine. Alt text may also be used for computer source code to identify the programming language which advanced clients may use for syntax highlighting.

Preformatted text is for text that shouldn't be formatted by the client.
Meaning it should be shown to the user as-is, using it to add metadata
would be wrong, see section 5.4.4 (Preformatted text lines):

Why? Things like "publication-date" or "author" are certainly
metadata that most readers would like to know.

That's not what I meant...
Preformatted text wouldn't be read out by screenreaders, the alt text would.

The "data:text/gemini-metadata+json;charset=ut......." is the part
that would be read out.
"Welcome!" would be ignored (unless it detects that it's ok to read
out, or the user says they want it read out).

OFC this all depends on the implementation of screenreader.

The reason we (at lest I) like gemtext is that it's easy to read and 
write, and that for both humans and machines. Putting metadata behind 
two or three layers of encoding and/or hiding it in elements that were 
not intended to store page metadata won't make it easier to parse it 
(for both)!

I personally like Oliver's approach, that makes the metadata both 
machine and human readable and forces it to the end of the document, so 
that it stays out of the way on clients that don't have support for 
hiding it.

## Meta about metadata

Of course we have to standardize some keys and value types to make the 
metadata actually useful for machines, but in a way that is human 
readable/writable and easy to parse.
No "anything that <command> can parse" is not a good standard at all,
if that approach had been used for gemtext it would have turned into a 
mess pretty quickly and nobody would care.

A gemini client could implement an existing protocol, like rsync or sftp,
to achieve the goal of not requiring any additional software to manage a
capsule.

So you are using status code 12 to signal the client to use a different
kind of request. What happens when a client interpretes that as a status
code 10? (As it should if it doesn't understand 12.)

To escape the 1k limits of the URL in responses to 10 and 11, my

Introducing a new kind of request into gemini would be a mistake, I think.
We have seen proposals for side protocols on this list to fill this space
but they didn't get popular.

Since I then needed to be able to tell the difference between requests that

Such links could also start with something like "gemini+edit://" so that
only clients supporting this feature can access it.

Ah, so the client only get status code 12 if it has an account. I missed
that the first time I read through your e-mail. I also missed that it
supports editing of existing text.

Ah... and another point... how does the server know when to stop reading

TLS close_notify from the client maybe?

I think the simplicity of only having "<URL>CRLF" requests outweighs any
benefits we get from this approach.

Subject: Split Gemini spec into two specs?
Message-ID: <CAFkF85akmzEzmr44Jkov_fZNh1GDVrKzT+CkMjkeZGovAUV-mw@mail.gmail.com>

At current the Gemini spec is dual-purpose, it describes the protocol,
and the text/gemini format.

Whilst gemtext is the "native" format for Gemini (as HTML is to HTTP),
one isn't required for the other to work, they are two distinct
things.
I think that they should be split into two specs, one for the protocol
and one for gemtext.

What would people think of this?

The client should not be sending a body to the server, requests are

Having bodies allows for the expansion of the Gemini protocol, and
would make it much like HTTP.

I put some example metadata below my last E-Mail but after catching up 
with the rest of the discussion since writing it, and thinking a bit 
about it, I've come to the conclusion that I should add a littlebit of 
explanation.

First and foremost: I consider this st its current stage a (thought) 
experiment and MAYBE a future convention for gemtext.

Something I really shouldn't have to write, but to clarify:
With great power comes great responsibility!
Adding metadata adds great power and whoever is implementing a metadata 
based feature should ask themselves if what they are doing is the right 
thing to encourage (this applies to all things you are implementing).


> 
> ^^^
> version: 1 > date-written: 21-02-23 11:09 +0100
I added that one first and of course I messed it up.
It should be:
date written: 2021-02-23 11:09 +0100
I choose this format because it's easy to parse for humans and computer 
alike for dates. The key consists of two keywords: date and written a 
client that cares about metadata but wants to keep it simple can simply 
search for the first thing starting with date. (Maybe just having date 
is enough)
> author: Baschdel
> => mailto:baschdel at disroot.org author contact E-Mail
I'm using link lines for uris here because then they will still work if 
the client ignores the metadata, the contact keyword tells the client 
that this link is contact information.
the E-Mail is just a label for humans (I don't know if adding the label 
without any special delimiter is a good thing or not, it will definitely 
make it less easy to extend this)
> => mailto:gemini at lists.orbitalfox.eu?subject=? reply contact
Same as above without a label for humans, a client could show a reply 
button at the bottom of the page
> style: E-Mail message
Can of Worms! nasty ones!
Thinking about it, it would be a good thing to add styling hints (for 
example that this is a fee page or  search results page) but this would 
encourage writing gemtext, that is overloading linetypes left and right 
because some people don't realize, that styling and meaning are two 
different things.
> => https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2021/005420.html answerto > => https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2021/005522.html mirror
Two tagged links, one linking to the message this one is an answer to 
another one linking to a mirror of this page (following this system an 
alternative link to an answer would be tagged with "answerto mirror")

To prevent content authors and/or server from going wild I'd suggest, 
that clients always show the metadata section like it would render the 
page above.

One thing I don't really like with this one is, that we use English 
keywords here and that for human readable text that is intended to be 
attached to a file, that could be in any language and is not very 
accessible to non-English speakers.

A possible solution to that could be in unicode and (you guessed it, 
didn't you?) emoji (yay!), at least those little pictures are 
standardized and independent of the language(s) you speak. (Just make 
sure the emoji makes sense for what it is used)

I know Vulpes does [3], but it's a web proxy, not a "native" browser,

keyboard-triggered scolling.  Are there any others?

Message-ID: <3ACT1MZXOXGQD.2FWXQ5MHDCZGZ@nothien.uber.space>

I'm just going to quickly address everything about the metadata ideas /
proposals:

    They're not necessary.

I'm going to split it into two groups: metadata affecting presentation,
and metadata about the document.

# Metadata for Presentation

Gemini is (in specification and in spirit) against any specification of
presentation.  Stuff like favicons or colors as a part of the document
are problematic because you're going above and beyond the /one/ thing
that Gemini is trying to do: provide content without presentation.
Instead of trying to introduce these, please work within the limits that
Gemini has already presented to you.

# Metadata for the Document

What's the /point/ of standardizing a format for providing metadata
about a document?  Seriously, I don't understand.  What's the benefit of
letting a client know who the author is?  If you, an author, want users
to know that you wrote something, just write "I wrote this".  These
kinds of proposals are unnecessary.  If you want it to be read properly
by a screen reader, just write in full sentences ('this was written on
the 23rd of February').  Keep it open, prevent it from turning into a
matter of convention, and think about how to solve problems /without/
extending the specification in any way.  Even if it's
"backward-compatible", you're creating a rift in Gemini - see "Problems
with Conventions" below.

# "It's Just A Suggestion/Idea"

The problem with 'just' posting ideas and suggestions and proposals like
these is that they waste everyone's time (including yours).  Instead of
trying to add new, unnecessary, and unwanted features to Gemini, start
creating content within it!  We (and I'm speaking for a lot of people
here) are tired of dealing with new ideas from eager new Geminiauts who
keep trying (consciously or unconsciously) to reinvent the Web.  Please
/stop/ thinking about Gemini like it's the Web, or a replacement, or
anything of the sort!  Come to Gemini with an open mind to what it's
trying to do.  Read the spec, read the FAQ, read the companion
documents, read the mailing list, and /understand/ the spirit of Gemini.

# The Problem with Conventions

Conventions are naturally difficult because you're politely asking
people to do something.  This separates the Gemini userbase into people
who have done that thing and people who haven't.  If you want to create
a new convention, /please/ think about the effect this can have,
particularly with conventions involving presentation.  As others have
pointed out, every new convention threatens to make a split in the user
base, and if anyone (user or site) can for any reason prefer one side
over the other, you've begun the process of separation.  Don't do that,
because we're just going to have to shoot your shit down.

# Compatibility

Another issue with conventions is the fact that we have over 200
individual pieces of software which use Gemini in its current state.
This makes Gemini /very/ resistant to change, because we don't have the
manpower to update all of that software.  This is why the spec is now in
a near-freeze state - all we want to do now is make clarifications to
the existing spec and to not add new things.

# Conclusion

Please stop.

Thanks.

Elaho an iOS client does that by default I think (it can be disabled).

Oh Jason you beat me to the punch lolz.

Yes I was just this very minute playing with ASCII-art generators for a
kewl teapot response page delivered with status code 20.

I figured I might need this after checking a few  webproxies. some
respect robots.txt, some don't. I understand that some of those authors
may not view their proxy as a bot, but middleware it is. It may not have
ever occured to them to accommodate that part of the spec.

to further complicate things where my philosophy is concerned, and this
was pointed out yesterday or so with the explanation as to what exactly
a "webproxy" is, due to the necessarily vague verbiage in the spec.

What if, Someone uses something like what Bitreich has with their SSH
kiosk, to enable people to burrow Gopherholes? I've actually thought of
deploying a service like this for Gemini...

But if I authored such a thing, I myself would have to say that yes, I'm
going to have to consider my product a webproxy and not violate a
Disallow rule for webproxy user agents.

And certainly, my specific intent here is not to stymie that sort of
vehicle. My beef, is I don't want any of the unique content that I
publish in Gopher space or Gemini space leaking to HTTP space. I just
loathe the thought of that - What purpose does Gopher or Gemini have
where the client side is concerned if it's just going to be published in
HTML.

In fact, I rarely, and I mean rarely ever publish anything in HTTP space
that exists in either Gopher or Gemini space. I maintained a package
repo containing well over ten thousand slackware packages back in the
Slackware 9 and 10 days, and none of those packages were obtainable via
HTTP - only gopher.

To me (no point in debating me on this as it's simply how I feel about
it), having "Unique" content in a particular aspect of a network breeds
relevance for the usage of that space. With Gemini, I see much more
potential than simple phlogs in Gemini capsules here in the future.

But enough of why I feel that it's important enough for me to be kinda a
dik about it with respect to the way I brought it up the other day. I
try to be a lot nicer than that most of the time lolz.

Now I'm just thinking of my own properties in the following, so it may
or may not be applicable or attractive to others now or in the future -
or NOT. Either way is kewl :)

So short of /dev/null routing tables, I think a CIDR based event handler
for Vger might be worth a go, because as it has been pointed out, it's
an actual user that will receive the page for all of those URLs. Instead
of baking this into the the daemon of Vger, perhaps it would be more
elegant to forward the packets to another Gemini service with something
like go-mmproxy and simply serve a single page with that HTTP 418
graphic for any and all requests?

I'll still have to manually hunt down the offending webproxy bots that
refuse to comply with the published spec:

gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/companion/robots.gmi

But that's not so difficult, since most are eager to advertise as a
public service (and most with good intentions, to be certain).

I'm long past being angry about it. Now it just feels like a fun little
tinkering project to play around with. This problem is not unique to
Gemini space - the bat bot phenomenon has plagued the HTTP space for
decades, but as the spec points out, it's different with Gemini, because
there's no user agent to assist in the identification process.

Although I think serving a .gmi with an HTTP 418 graphic is quite
hilarious, there's an undercurrent that is sinister on another,
non-technical level.

I have wanted to believe that I can incorporate copyright law into the
things that I personally wish to share with the world by using things
like the GPL v2 (and in some instances the AGPL) or with a CC-BY-SA. But
this matter has me questioning if that's going to afford others (and
myself) the protections I choose for my works.

Do I need to do something like "Copyright 2021 all rights reserved?" or
will simply racheting things up a little bit to a CC-BY-ND legally
protect my intellectual property from being converted into HTML?

And what about the other user agents? Search engines like Gus and
Houston? Will they think that maybe they shouldn't crawl and index
servers that state that webproxies aren't welcome - I certainly don't
wish for that to happen, those are not simply valuable services to the
community, but in the coming years they're going to be vital.

And what about the archiver agetns? are they going to store their
results in space that includes HTTP servers?

It's potentially a whole can "O" worms.

My position is quite simple. I don't want ANYONE to be able to read,
surf or access content on Vger from a web browser via HTTP protocol.
This of course, excludes plugins like Geminize, because the user is
actually using native Gemini protocol to access Gemini space.

Very simple concept to me. It makes Gopher more valuable. it makes
Gemini more valuable (provided the content is worth visiting via the
native protocols).

And I really don't want people to have to adhere to a "No Derivitive"
clause in a creative commons license. I want them to be able to take my
toys and edit them and share them with others in a form that suits the
greater good (Yes, even if  that means they put that shit on a web
server - they just have to retrieve it via Gemini or Gopher client).

I really don't know the answers to all of the questions that may raise,
and maybe that's where the discussion should go, coz I don't see any
roadblocks adressing this technically, or in a neighborly fashion. It's
the people who choose an immoral approach that may beg of licensing and
copyright discussions.

But in the end... Hey man, what do I know? I'm just a teapot :)

I wholeheartedly agree, please stop proposing unnecessary complexity that benefits nobody (just for the sake of normalizing everything) or adds client display fancyness.
We should always consider underpowered devices, screen readers, people with a slow internet connection. I know TLS is already a burden for some of these cases so let?s not add more data to transfer.

Though I agree with the principle, and it would make a lot of sense in many larger projects, binding the protocol tightly to the content is appropriate at this scale and for this purpose. Unlike many projects which anticipate substantial sprawl, and welcome that effect, the Gemini spec aims to avoid becoming easily contaminated with features, an intentional constraint.

I'm no zealot here, but I do find the cleanliness and constraint refreshing.

'Nuff said. We need to start focusing on the finer details rather than 
coming up with new ones. Sure, it might be a good idea in your head, but 
at one point or another the spec **will** be frozen.

Thanks for sharing!

I added your bit of elisp to my config, but it handles only gemini links
inside org documents, which I don't use very often.  But digging around
I ended up with something that seems to work in other buffers too:

    ;; mu4e specific:
    (setq mu4e~view-beginning-of-url-regexp
          "https?\\://\\|mailto:\\|gemini://")

    ;; generic: (?)

    (add-to-list 'thing-at-point-uri-schemes "gemini://")

    (defun my/browse-url-elpher (url &rest _args)
      "Open URL with `elpher-go'."
      (elpher-go url))

    (add-to-list 'browse-url-default-handlers
                 '("\\`gemini:" . my/browse-url-elpher))

With this I'm able to M-x browse-url with the point near a Gemini link
and open it on elpher!

Cheers!

The current spec, while it is the "formal" spec, is intended to be
rather informal (compared to other specs), and I suppose it was just
easier to group them together at the time.

Something that should be emphasized more IMO, since people don't seem to
understand this every time they suggest to add inline markup.

I'm sure if Solderpunk ever pursues submitting it as a formal RFC
(something that he was contemplating, but wanted to wait until the final
spec freeze) then the IETF would help us formalize it and organize it
more coherently.  Using my knowledge of how RFCs are structured I'm
fairly sure they would both be in one RFC but separated meaningfully.
The current spec has gemtext separated, but the distinction could be
made more clear.

That is correct, Elaho currently inlines all images, frankly it was
the simplest thing to implement, and I also didn't expect gemini space
to have so many images. However, since it's breaking in the upcoming
release I want to mimic Largange's behaviour where each inlining is
explicitly triggered by a user action, same domain or not.

This is on the roadmap as I understand it, when converting the specification to RFCs it will be split into two RFCs.

But I cannot find where I read that anymore, so maybe I?m not remembering correctly?

I like  the favicon proposal,  i do not  think is harmful,  illegal or
morally wrong when the choice to use this feature is left to user with
an  opt-in mechanism,  moreover  i think  the best  way  to resist  to
tracking is to keep the protocol  simple so that many different client
can exists and  people could choose the client that  better fits their
tastes or needs.

FWIW I am going to keeps favicon as opt-in feature in my client.

Moreover i  am likely  the only  user of my  client so  if you  find a
request to  favicon.txt probably  you can consider  this my  salute to
you! :-D

The protocol and content aren't bound tightly in any way, Gemtext is
the default and is in the same document, that's all.
Splitting the documents wouldn't change anything, and I don't want
anything to change as Gemtext is really nice, I just thought it would
make sense to have them split.

Myself I've more been thinking of the how and not the why with this,
and I apologise for that.
Most of the examples given here are pretty pointless for clients,
nobody has suggested any uses for metadata other than to replace the
favicon thing, author, and the "when" of the document.
The only major uses I can think of is for orbits (webrings), and it
would help search engines.
It's pretty pointless.

All existing software would still work. This is only an addition.
About the freezing, I got the impression it was only the protocol that
was frozen.

By that, I mean things like the favicon and color proposals, which were
also bunched under the 'metadata' umbrella category/name.

I agree, it's not useful, but I wanted to cover a few of the cases you
mentioned.  I disagree with the favicon feature as a whole, so I'm not
going to touch that.  I don't know how webrings are organized on Gemini,
but I'm not sure how the author or date would matter there.  From my
understanding, these things typically link to the whole gemini capsules,
which should already provide author information, and I don't think date
info is relevant here.  We already have the gmisub companion spec for
describing gemlog posts and similar dated content.  Search engines
typically date content based on when they first indexed it, so that's
not an issue either.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be the case.

The issue is not that it would break pre-existing software, but that it
would make it less appealing to use, compared to new software which does
implement the new additions.  This applies to clients and servers and
everything in between.  That's the 'rift' I was talking about in my
original mail.

I think that makes sense for Gopher, but not for Gemini.  As we saw a day
or two ago, Gemini servers are designed to serve many files that are not
text/gemini, and are actually doing so.  Indeed, there is no reason that an
HTTP server can't serve text/gemini as well, and hopefully an HTTP proxy
will recognize text/gemini content and pass it through unchanged.

I feel pretty confident that the IETF will want them to be split.

I understood what you meant, was just expressing my view of it :)

IMO the favicon isn't presentation, it's dosent modify the document itself.
I don't really know if I like/dislike the favicons, so I'd like to refrain
from commenting on this much, I just know that I don't like their current
form (of a seperatate request).

I think there's been some misunderstanding - date and author etc don't have
anything to do with webrings as you said.

 I understand your concern, and it's something we should aim to avoid, but
this kind of mindset prevents innovation.
If we stop creating new, or modifying old, because the old would get left
behind, we will forever be stagnant.
(To clarify, I'm talking in general there and not just about Gemini)



# My conclusion on the metadata topic

I think the discussion of the how (format and what it would affect) has
been good, but we should stop with it untill a good why (reasoning and use
case) has been found.

  There is another group:  metadata affecting navigation.

  Years ago, there was an extention for Firefox (back when I think it was
just known as Mozilla) that would use metadata in the <HEAD> section of a
web page to construct a navigation bar for the site.  The metadata included:

	next		next "page" in the collection
	previous	previous page in the collection
	first		first page in the collection
	last		last "page" in the collection
	up		up one level of the collection tree
	top		top level in the collection
	home		the entry page (might not be the same as top)
	about		about the collection
	archive		page listing each page in the collection
	search		search the collection
	glossary	list of terms used in the collection
	copyright	copyright status of page
	canonical	canonical link to page

  Yes, these can all be just links on a page.  But the idea was not to
clutter the page with these links, but construct a UI element with the
navigation items.  This could include a navigation bar (what I experienced),
but it could also be a menu item, a popup menu, or keyboard shortcuts for
each each one, depending upon the client.

  The Gemini portal at <https://portal.mozz.us> only gives us two of these:
up and top.

  Such metadata could include a summary of the page, keywords, copyright
status, location data (location here being the location the page is about,
not the location of the author or reader), time (when the page in question
was written, when it's about, etc.) in addition to the author, in a format
that is easy for a machine to recognize.  A good example is a search engine
could use this information instead of having to attempt to identify it from
the text alone.

  Unwanted by you, others might want it.  I think there are better arguments
against this than just "don't do it."  That does nothing to convince those
that want it to stop working on it.  They might just go ahead and do it
anyway.

  Yes.  And for the first year about the *only* topic being discussed was
the format for text/gemini.  It is *still* being talked about, only not
quite so much.

  Having been on this list from the beginning, I can say that the majority
(I would say nearly all) of the proposals have not gone anywhere.  Why? 
Because it's easy to make a proposal, it's apparently impossible to get
anyone to actually *implenent* the damn things, even as a
"proof-of-concept".  That people are lazy is an incredible filter.

  There were two people who came into the mailing list (at different times),
incredulous that TLS was used.  "It's horrible!" they said.  "You should use
something better!" they said.  A simple task of taking them at face value
and saying, "Okay.  Show us!  Implement a server and client so we can see
how much easier and better your ideas are," worked wonders.  One simply
disappeared.  The other actually did the work, and withdrew the idea
(because implementing crypto is not easy).

  Now we have a much strong case for "Why TLS?"  Just "shooting your shit
down" only serves to piss people off.

  It won't.  In six months we'll have a new crop of people asking.

  Yes, that's the tag the extension used, but the extension itself created a
UI element based off the <link rel> tags in the <head> section.

I second gmnisrv, it's what I currently use and I have a couple of legacy domains running in separate doc roots with their own certs.  It handles its own cert generation too.

I've found it incredibly simple to set up, modify the ini file with the hostname, root directory for the content, and start-up gmnisrv.

Also don't take the stability of the oh.mg gemini server as any indication of gmnisrv.  I run it on a terrible VM with practically no memory and a lot of hope.  But it works for the most part.

Subject: [tech] Geminipg: using Gnupg to sign Gemini pages and directories
Message-ID: <20210224000746.2afab99f@chris-nux>

Hi all!

This is a proposal to add signature capability to any page or
directory. Indeed, this could also be applicable to an HTML service.
The point is, with Gemini, that the page you get on Gemini is just like
it appears to be.

You may need to publish and be sure that like people can check the
pages. People may want to be sure that the text was signed by its
alleged author.

## For a file:

gpg --detach-sign --armor --output index.gmi.sig index.gmi

The file "index.gmi" is signed using the current certificate. The
signature is a binary file.

gpg --verify index.gmi.sig index.gmi

The command checks the signature and returns the date and the key used.

## For a directoy:

sha256sum directory/* | gpg --clear-sign --output directory.sig

All the file of "directory" are sha256-sumed. The results go in a file that is signed.


# On the server side

## One signature for one file

./chapter_1.gmi
./chapter_1.sig
./chapter_2.gmi
./chapter_2.sig

## Several signatures for one file

./page.gmi
./page.gmi.sig/
./page.gmi.sig/{sha256 of the signed file}-{fingerprint of the signing key #1}.sig
./page.gmi.sig/{sha256 of the signed file}-{fingerprint of the signing key #2}.sig

## One signature for one directory

./mybook/chapter_1.gmi
./mybook/chapter_2.gmi
./mybook.sig

## Several signatures for one directory

./mybook/chapter_1.gmi
./mybook/chapter_2.gmi
./mybook.sig/ : {sha256 of the signed file list}-{fingerprint of the
signing key #1}.sig /mybook.sig/ : {sha256 of the signed file
list}-{fingerprint of the signing key #2}.sig


# On the client side:

Signatures discovery for ./directory/page.gmi :

1. ./directory/page.gmi.sig # one signature
2. ./directory/page.gmi.sig/ # several signatures for one page
3. ./directory.sig # all the files of the directory for one signature
4. ./directory.sig/ # all the files of the directory for several signatures

In such a case, the server must return a directory index or a
"index.gmi" containing all the links for the signatures.

# Publishing

The writer signs the files before publishing them. The server may also
generate the signature on the fly ; it regenerates the signature if the
file is newer than the signature.

# General requirements:

* It's optional and must work with a non-aware browser and server.
* The whole page content is signed.
* The filename and the URI of the page mustn't be part of the signature.
* It must always be possible to check by hand, just downloading the
  page, the signatures and verify each signature.

Thanks in advance for all point of view and remarks!

Standard disclaimer: I am very much not a lawyer.

While this won?t make you many friends online, it?s worth pointing out that you can get much further with a Disallow: line and a DMCA takedown request than you can with a Disallow: line alone.

That said, if the other party pushes back, you might end up having to pay lawyers to litigate novel caselaw regarding proxying of content. Then again, all this might?ve been settled by websites that put their banners on things and stick your site in an <iframe> in the middle of it all.

Could also just use a different protocol for (complex) editing. Maybe
export the source files over 9P.

In think that believing pictures are culture-independant is an
illusion. The same image will be meaningful for someone, meaningless
for an other and offensive for a third. The proper solution is to have
standard keys, and structured metadata, so the client program will be
able to replace them with locally significant labels (like email
clients do with Date:, Subject:, From:, etc).

(For fun and thinking, someone actually proposed to replace HTTP
status codes by emojis. I made a list of the proposals at
<https://www.bortzmeyer.org/http-code-emoji.html>. It's in french but
you can see the list of codes and the emojis that were actually
proposed. Good luck for finding a proper one.)

Nothing is necessary (except eating and breathing) but metadata are
useful.

This argument surprised me. All the people who professionally manage
documents use metadata. I didn't think it was necessary to explain
their uses. So, let's try;

Using structured metadata allows you to search into documents those
written, by John Guy (or Alice Gal). grep or other tools for
unstructured searches don't help here since they cannot tell the
difference between a page written by Alice Gal and a page discussing
the life of Alice Gal.

Other examples of useful metadata: date of publication so you can
find, for instance, the most recent, or exclude those that are too old
/ too young, licence, so you can find "only documents under a free
licence", etc.

Basically, it is not because YOU don't use them and don't see the
point of them that nobody does.

This is not parsable, so useless for programs.

I strongly disagree. What's the point of this mailing list if not to
discuss ideas when some of them (may be most of them) will turn out to
be wrong? We can think of better tools for discussion, of course
(separate mailing lists, issue trackers, whatever), but we need a
place to receive and discuss ideas.

Otherwise, what will happen? Since the Internet is permissionless,
people will do it anyway. And probably in a worse way. If "we" (we
being "the Wise Gemini People" or "Gemini Experts" or something like
that) reject everything (or even if we are PERCEIVED as rejecting
everything), people will do it elsewhere and may be do it badly. We
cannot (and don't want to) prevent people from doing Gemini stuff
outside of the "Gemini Official Channels" but we can at least act in
good faith, and propose them a serious and documented way to have
proposals examined (and may be rejected, but not dismissed without a
serious examination).

> We (and I'm speaking for a lot of people here) are tired of dealing

Then, the solution is for these people to stop subscribing to the
[spec] tag (or move to a separate mailing list, my personal opinion is
that we need several lists).

And new Geminauts are a good thing, this is the goal we try to reach.

This is really patronizing. Most people who sent proposals on the
mailing list clearly know about Gemini and studied the matter
seriously. Of course, there are some guys sending stupid wild ideas
but they are a very small (and unavoidable) minority.

Your contempt is the kind of attitude which risk to turn away people,
either completely away from Gemini, or towards a de-facto fork.

AFAIK, there is no published and "official" roadmap, just ideas on the
mailing list and may be a folder with files, in Solderpunk's home directory.

This is one of the weaknesses of Gemini, there is no visibility on
what is "work in progress".

Actually, it is a concrete form ("serialization") of links, which are
an abstract concept, and can be in HTTP headers ('Link:'), in HTML
text, in Atom feeds, etc.

The standard for links is RFC 8288
<gemini://gemini.bortzmeyer.org/rfc-mirror/rfc8288.txt>.

All these are official standardized types of links, in the IANA
registry
<https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xml#link-relations-1>. For
instance, "canonical" was registered in RFC 6596
<gemini://gemini.bortzmeyer.org/rfc-mirror/rfc6596.txt> to link to the
canonical URI of this resource.

[snip]

One example: when the capsule's owner has included date metadata, then
searches there can be expanded or narrowed according to date.  The same
for title, author, subject, or any other field that has been maintained
throughout the capsule.  With machine readable metadata in place, the
system can then do the work when limiting searches.

Another example: browsing through a 'tag cloud', also known as subject
categories, is very common.  That is one way of browsing through a set
of subjects in document metadata and is a case where it is not niche.

An example of when metadata is is not allowed or missing would be plain
full-text searches.  One well-known confound for full-text searching is
when a page talks about a topic in great detail without actually
including repetition of strings pertaining to that topic.  A lot of
technical writers within ICT know of this problem and pepper their
writing with expected search terms.  Writers, especially researchers, in
other fields just write to the topic and might not even include the
subject terms more than once if even that.  Thus full-text searching is
quite inaccurate, even with stemming, and does not scale well.

The actual metadata content can be made up as needed, as in uncontrolled
vocabulary, or it can conform to an agreed upon, restricted set, such as
ERIC or LCSH.

After capsules reach substantial size, both in number and length of
documents, it becomes impractical to rummage for content manually and
full-text becomes increasingly inaccurate.  It gets even harder to do
relevant searches if the content in the pages is all about the same
topic or similar, overlapping topics which share vocabulary.  There,
without the fielded searches which document metadata enables, the
material is effectively lost.  So some of use-cases for document
metadata deal with trying to retrieve material from largish capsules.

Agreed. Or, at the very least, read every last metadata discussion in
the list archive, and understand why those discussions ended in the
proposed convention not being adopted *before* posting yet another
proposed convention.

gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/faq.gmi
Section 4 "Contributing to the Gemini project" should have a new subsection "Roadmap". It would probably list the 3 month spec freeze we had during spring last year and the (after the fact) deadline we had for non-trivial changes when we were supposed to go into a 6 month spec freeze in the early summer.

I agree that this syntax makes sense and is easy to read: as you say, it
degrades to plain text nicely, so there is no pressure to do anything in
particular with it.  However, it makes the information available to search
engines in such a way that it is possible to find documents.

VERY IMPORTANT:  I do *not* think that this convention needs to be part of
the text/gemini spec, because understanding it is not a requirement for
clients.  One client (for human use) can render an =: line as an ordinary
gemtext line; another client can ignore such lines; a smarter client can
render them but translate "language en" into "English language" and "format
text/html" into "HTML".

Search engines and other metadata processors have the same three choices.
A simple approach to making use of metadata  is to treat "creator Crowder,
Mary" in the index as if it were "creator:Crowder creator:Mary", thus
allowing people to search for these things Google-style, without confusing
them with subject:Crowder.

Here's some lines in the above format for characterizing one of Project
Gutenberg's books.  This is an extensive example:  I do not mean that
typical metadata creators will use anything this complex.

=: pgterms.ebook 22222
=: creator Crowther, Mary Owens
=: language en
=: subject Etiquette
=: type Text
=: title How to Write Letters (Formerly The Book of Letters) A Complete
Guide to Correct Business and Personal Correspondence

text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 =: size 508856 bytes
=> https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22222.rdf := format application/rdf+xml

 Note that some metadata lines are actually links to other formats of this
book, so a metadata-aware processor would look at links and see that after
the URL there is an "=:" and process it as metadata.  For this reason, I do
not think that metadata lines should be required to be in a fixed place in
the document: I have put the links at the end because they are most likely
less important to people than the rest of the metadata.

In addition, "=:" lines can be joined together if they are related, with a
second "=:" on the same line, since that is unlikely to be part of the
value.  This provides the benefit of structured metadata with a depth of 1.

Note to Lars and other metadata people:  I have simplified
"dcterms.creator" to "creator" and "dcterms.subject.LCSH" to "subject", so
as not to be too scary-looking.  I have also omitted some of the available
formats of this particular book.

This is my recommendation. People come to Gemini with the experience of
the web, where the line protocol is both a floor wax AND a dessert
topping. But there's really no reason that things have to be done that
way. IMO, if a client wants to provide editing and publishing
capabilities (which is a good idea), it should use rsync over SSH, with
public-key authentication. All of this can be baked into the client, so
that the user never has to deal with it.

I'm sorry, I wasn't considering the case of gemtext as a storage format,
only of it as a communication format.

Let me make my argument more specific: author and date and related
metadata isn't useful to a receiving /client/ because there's nothing it
can do with it.  These can certainly be helpful for stored gemtext files
(although there are other places metadata can be stored, e.g. in a
database), as they provide this information to the /server/ to which it
is useful (particularly for searching and categorizing).

And to understand anything about Algol 68 (the programming language) you
must first understand everything about Algol 68.  Fortunately, this
recursion is broken: you don't have to understand everything *in depth* to
understand any one thing in depth.  Consequently, the tutorial "Algol 68
with fewer tears" gives you a shallow introduction to the whole language,
and having read that you can read any of the following sections on
particular topics.

That is true, provided you understand "client" as "client for human use"
only.  A search engine is a server with respect to its users, but a client
(of a special kind) with respect to the servers it is indexing.

However, it does not mean that metadata is useless to the *user*.  For
example, a user who wishes to do something more with the document than just
read it can look for "rights" metadata to see what is and isn't allowed.
This can be a Creative Commons or FSF/OSI license name or tag, or just
plain text.  (On this basis, I now think that recommending clients to hide
metadata is wrong unless the client provides a way of displaying it.  If
your client doesn't understand metadata, it will display it anyway, and
that's fine.)

By keeping metadata in-band it is much easier to make sure it is not lost
as documents are mirrored and otherwise passed around.  My extensive
example provides a link to formal RDF metadata for those who understand it.

The metadata proposal is very simple and I doubt that implementation

Hi all,

First time posting on this mail list or any mail list for that matter.
Let me know if I'm responding on it incorrectly. Just sharing my
thoughts on metadata. I personally don't think metadata should be
included in the same way that HTML uses metadata with <meta> tags.

Metadata is only useful if something about the file format demands it
be meta. For audio or video formats I can see this being the case as
aside from file name(which would be a very messy and not very universal
way to include it) there's not much a person can do. Gemtext doesn't
suffer this issue, a person can write the date written, published and
the author(s if there's more than one) in a way that fits best with the
document. If this data is omitted, then usually the author chose to omit
it as that data isn't relevant to the content displayed on the page. On
this point, a lot of the metadata included in websites, is very much a
victim of the same thing, it should be data included directly with the
content if it's relevant... and it seems a lot of the metadatas that are
included are completely irrelevant to the content. Convince me otherwise

Only benefit seems to be to bots/softwares involving gemtext such as
clients, search engines or scrapers- and it would require creating a
standard for the metadata that someone would have to maintain, and
outreach to get people to adopt the standard in writing gemtexts and in
writing their clients- plus it encroaches a little bit on how long a
person should spend to write a gemini client of their own. That's a lot
of stuff just to have metadata that should be included as data in the
document.

For the reasons above, I'm relatively indifferent to metadata but think
it's a fair lot of time to pursue(at least to the same degree as <meta>
tags have gone). Personally, if a person was to create and adopt a
standard, I'd use it if it's useful AND human-readable.

Cheers mates,
- Aaron

Like John Cowan explained, you have a very restricted view of what a
Gemini client is. A crawler, for instance, is a /client/.

But even with "clients for interactive human use" such as Amfora or
Lagrange, metadata could be useful, for instance to help to bookmark
resources, or to present them differently.

This is what happened to the Web with the WHATWG (which, in all

problems was that the W3C was not listening).

To be fair, though, the products of the WHATWG have been almost
uniformly a disaster for the open web, and a way for Google to codify
Chrome as the unofficial browser reference implementation.

It is maybe important to note that much Gemini content is written with
just a text editor, by people who might not want to neatly structure
their metadata according to the convention. I'm not sure it would be a
good thing for search engines to rely much on metadata - the term
"search engine optimisation" comes to mind.

The user can also look for a line that says "This work is licensed
under...". Metadata need not be structured for human users to understand it.

Anyway, I think there are uses for in-file metadata, particularly for
searching a large collection of documents. And sure, it could be useful
to adopt a convention (either the "-:" line thing or the key-value pairs
at the end of the file thing, or something else entirely) just so that
people would have one way to do this that is commonly understood, and so
that broadly usable tools could be written for using metadata. However,
I don't think it is useful in most of Geminispace, and it should not be
used in places where there isn't a need for it. I definitely think we
should avoid it becoming an expectation for people who write stuff, or
for Gemini clients.

I also think we should choose a convention that is simple and not easily
extensible. The key-value pairs at the end of the file thing seems a bit
better on non-extensibility - it's definitely better on readability.

Subject: [tech] Announcing go-gemini v0.1.15
Message-ID: <C9HXLSWXKZ5T.2OGSL4ME8AMRD@nitro>

Version 0.1.15 of the go-gemini library has been released.

https://sr.ht/~adnano/go-gemini

go-gemini is an implementation of the Gemini protocol in Go. It aims to
make it easy to develop Gemini clients and servers, and to provide an
API similar to Go's net/http library. It also improves on the API of
Go's net/http library to resolve issues that they cannot due to
backwards compatiblity, so arguably developing with go-gemini is now
better (in some ways) than developing with net/http. :D

On the client side, it features support for trust on first use, loading
and saving known hosts, proxying requests to other hosts, and IDNs.
On the server side, it features support for automatic certificate
creation, rotating expired certificates, handling non-gemini schemes,
and streaming responses.

At this point, the API of go-gemini is relatively stable and should not
be subject to constant change as was the case earlier on in development.
I eventually plan on releasing v0.2.0, which should have a better
guarantee of stability. In the longer term, I plan on releasing v1.0.0
when the Gemini specification is finalized and published as a standard.

Enjoy!

As with most things in Gemini, this would be entirely optional.
Either the =: or my format wouldn't take much longer to code into
clients, as they are both based on existing features and follow all of
Gemtext's simplicity rules on line-by line etc.
Outreach luckily isn't much of an issue - most of the people that will
need to know are on this mailing list, and if/once it is a thing it
will be documented.
I don't understand your "maintaining" a standard point, it's a
standard, it should not be changed once it's been decided on (except
minor adjustments if required).

It should DEFINITElY be human-readable, Gemini (the protocol + text
format) is supposed to be a "human-style" thing.

SEO would potentially be worse without metadata, as is obvious
whenever you use the web.
The first search results are often articles full of "fluff", cooking
recipes will for some reason have a backstory, this isn't the
metadata, this is the document itself being full of junk.
The opposite is true though, people could use metadata to their
advantage, but with it being structured it's easier to filter the junk
out, and it also makes adding junk a bit harder.
I've never done SEO myself - so I may be entirely wrong - but this is
just my perspective on it.

Someone searching for freely-licenced (etc) documents is going to have
a hard time in that case, they would have to go through every document
manually to find the license.
Having it always at the end would be faster for people manually
reading, and would mean search engines/similar could just be asked to
filter out licenses they don't want (or do want).

Agree - It certainly shouldn't be used *everywhere*, at least not to a
large extent.
I'm going to say a typical page would have around MAXIMUM ~3/4 lines,
but Bill Gates also said 640K would be enough so who knows.

Also, I've thought of a great use - email archives.
Data could be added upon archival by whatever's archiving it (not by
the people writing emails - that would be stupid).
Searching them would be made easier if you could just tell your
searcher to filter to this:

Yes, and the Geminisphere may come to that too.  But that depends on us.
Since there's no obvious way to commercialize it (except by selling a
whomped-up client or server, in which case it has to be really super-duper
to beat the free competition), there aren't those kinds of pressures.

Hits, after all, aren't a benefit to the server owner: they are a cost.
The only way to benefit monetarily from a hit is if you sell something as a
result.

The user can also look for a line that says "This work is licensed

Of course.  Digital signatures aren't either: there was one case at Bell
Labs where someone signed a letter by mentioning what the recipient ate
last week at their shared lunch.  Nevertheless, people do find it handy to
have their computers help them along.

Anyway, I think there are uses for in-file metadata, particularly for

Part of the problem there is without a signal like "=: " that isn't likely
to be ordinary content, it's easy to get confused.  Consider this:

=====CUT HERE=====
This exchange of dialogue is an example of the rhetorical figure called
"stichomythia", where each character in a play says one line or part of a
line and then the next character responds with the next line or part of a
line; longer speeches are not allowed in such sequences.

Ferdinand: How well he's read, to reason against reading!
Dumain: Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
Longaville: He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.
Biron: The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.
Dumain: How follows that?
Biron: Fit in his place and time.
Dumain: In reason nothing
Biron: Something then in rhyme.
author: John Cowan
author: William Shakespeare
title: Stichomythia definition and illustration
title: Love's Labor's Lost I.i
=====CUT HERE=====

It's obvious to a human that the last four lines are metadata and the rest
is content.  But a metadata processor's job is much simplified if the last
four lines are:

=: author John Cowan
=: author William Shakespeare
=: title Stichomythia definition and illustration
=: title Love's Labor's Lost I.i

That makes it clear that "Longaville", for example, is not a key.  This is
Lars's proposal.  To it I add the convention that a link name beginning
with =: contains metadata applicable to the linked resource.  And that's
it.  I don't see that this is particularly more extensible than the
"unmarked key-value pairs at the end" convention.  As for readability, if
we can get used to seeing "=> " as a link, we can get used to "=: " as
metadata.

I don't think it would be a realistic expectation that all or even a
majority of authors will be including any given structured metadata
field in their pages. So when searching the whole Geminispace,
restricting a search to results with a certain value for the "license"
field will never be very effective. You have to either exclude or
include results that have no license field at all. In the first case you
don't know what you're missing, while in the second case you get lots of
things you don't want.

Also, some might put license information in a "license" field, while
others might put it in "rights". The license may have multiple different
names and abbreviations. These smaller problems could be combatted with
more conventions, but then metadata conventions would become ever more
complicated.

Basically, I think a metadata convention is of rather limited use for
the purpose of searching, unless you know that the set of articles in
which you're searching is actually using that convention, and in a
consistent way. And I think it would be hubris to expect most of the
Geminispace to start using such a convention, let alone consistently.

It appears you missed an important part of the key/value form: the toggle line.

A toggle line would be used (I suggested ^^^, but there may be a
better one), and it would be enable-only, there is no toggle off.
(extra toggles must be ignored by clients)
This enforces putting it at the end of a file, and prevents mixing it
with regular content, as being able to mix it would make Gemini
awfully easy to extend.
After the toggle the only acceptable lines would be either empty, or metadata.

Example:

# My lovely example
Hello, and welcome to example text.
=> /fooo Bar!
^^^
key: value
another-key: another-value

Here was my original email where I explained how I thought it would
work very roughly:

Very good point, I hadn't considered that.
One way (metadata), it's easier to do, but people that don't use it
will be hidden or mixed in.
The other, everyone is equal, but it's harder to do.

Unfortunately I don't think there's much of a solution to this :/

Whilst it's true anyone could use any key/values, I would hope that we
are civilised enough to be able to agree on what keys and values we
use.
I'm a contributor to OSM, and their saying goes:
> Feel free to invent new tags! Though it is not "feel free to ignore existing tagging schemes".
Simple. if you start using your own key/value, nothing is going to
support it, so you might as well use what everyone else uses.
BUT, as is obvious with OSM, if we don't get the keys/values organised
**from the start**, we will end up with different ways of doing that
same thing and, and I think anyone would agree, that is awful to work
with. If we get keys/values organised at the start though this isn't
really an issue.

Yup, there's not much use to it other than searching, or for linking
documents together (but we already have links to do that, so duh use
them).
Overall it's pretty pointless.

Meh. This is a very bogus argument. It's not either 100%, or nothing. It's a shade of grey in between. 

FWIW, I would suggest to guide people who would like to provide metadata to do it in an idiomatic Gemini way. Whatever this might be.

Stubborn tunnel vision and denial is not helping anyone.

To be candid: this is a terrible proposal. Terrible. Why reinvent the wheel? Badly? It's not even very idiomatic to Gemini. This is really not good at all. My opinion,

FWIW, it's my personal opinion that text/gemini should simply provide guideline on how to incorporated the last 20+ years of Web metadata. And that's that.

Don't reinvent that specific wheel. Just use it, if so inclined. Otherwise, move on.

I really like what you're trying to achieve, but maybe we can find a
solution than doesn't involve all those extra files / network requests.

Why not use a single SHA256SUMS file for all files on the capsule?  We
could put it in .well-known and sign it.  To generate it, we only need
a simple script that runs sha256sum recursively.  We end up with:

.well-known/key.pub
.well-known/SHA256SUMS
.well-known/SHA256SUMS.sign

A proof-of-concept client can also be a relatively simple shell script:

./verify.sh gemini://capsule.org/~user/file

It would first download the 3 well-known files, check the signature of
SHA256SUMS and keep it locally, along with the key.  Then it can verify
any file on gemini://capsule.org/~user/ without making additional
network requests.  On hash mismatch, it would check if SHA256SUMS
changed on the server.  It would apply TOFU on key.pub.  It could output
gemtext to stdout, to be piped into a client that renders it nicely.

Note that in this example, .well-known is under ~user, not directly
under capsule.org.  This is to account for multi-user systems
(pubnixes/tilde communities).

The 3 files can be merged into one, because why not?  So this system
involves one extra network request every once in a while, which makes
the client stand out fingerprinting-wise.  This slight privacy trade-off
is something to keep in mind when you use this feature - maybe only use
it sparingly, when you need the extra security.

That's it, in short.  It would work the same way on gemini, gopher and
the web.  I'll probably code this if nobody does it before me.

I also want to explore the idea of a signed "key-sources" file
containing links to the public key from multiple sources, for
cross-checking in case the key changes.  Not sure how this would work
exactly, I need to give it more thought.

Instead of GPG, I recommend OpenBSD's signify [1], which gives us nice
and short Ed25519 keys and signatures.  It's also available on GNU/Linux
(in Debian, `apt install signify-openbsd`).

There is already a good solution for page signing on the web [2], made
by the developer of EteSync (great guy).  The problem of included files
is solved by subresource integrity [3].

[1] https://man.openbsd.org/signify
[2] https://stosb.com/blog/signed-web-pages/
[3] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity


> Several signatures for one file

I don't think multiple signatures are worth the added complexity.  But
I'm curious if you have arguments to the contrary.

Still don?t get why a Gemini user would care about search engines and other tools to publish content but maybe I?m alone in this crowd and personal branding is the only thing that matter anyway.

[snip]

It is a matter of scope and it is why the use of document metadata is
generally found only in-house for local search and indexing
functionality:  Only you have control over your own documents and the
presence and quality of their metadata.  What goes into the metadata is
a different topic than the specification for encoding it.  So it is
possible for groups with common sets to collaborate.  Or not.

In-house, there is no substitute for the ability to browse or search
specific fields when retrieving from a pool of in-house documents.  A
simple specification for how to annotate key-value pairs is all that is
needed.  Nothing more.

A major benefit from standardized markup for key-values is that any
server-side software for indexing, browsing, and searching is easier to
share.  Think htdig but for a Gemini capsule.  Through the discussion
here I am starting to realize the importance of having a possibility for
capsules to choose whether to add metadata to their own documents.
Otherwise, there is a very low upper limit on the number of documents
they in practice are able to manage and make discoverable.

[snip]

I agree, if that is about settling on the way of writing arbitrary
key-value pairs within Gemini documents.  That would be something
analogous to what would be the meta element in XHTML:'

	<meta name="..." content="..." />

The spec there provides the element.  The people using the spec fill in
the data themselves through their own choice.  It is then up to them to
use or write software on their site which takes advantage of it to offer
one or more ways to navigate the accrued metadata.  Or not.

The actual contents of the key-value pairs, the actual metadata itself,
would not be part of the spec, not even the keys.  It would not be
appropriate to try to impose a custom vocabulary or even any existing
schemes like the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), Medical
Subject Headings (MeSH), Universal Decimal Classification (UDC), L??v,
or any other vocabulary.

Who is that someone? Neither you, nor me, apparently.

This list keeps on harping on that mythical "someone" archetype. 

Who is it? And who decides? And why should anyone care?

Rhetorical.

Message-ID: <s16d8m$acl$2@ciao.gmane.io>

How do you usually establish links within your capsule?

Considering your Gemlog or other pages, do you consistently put links at 
the bottom of each page to ...

* Home
* Up
* Previous
* Next post?

If we find that we all do it quite similarly, we might maybe want to see 
clients to put those links in a (navigation) sidebar, if applicable. I 
realise some clients offer a TOC to navigate along headings #, ##, ###.

Thank you for asking.

That would be indeed a perfect candidate for link rel, as discussed about two minutes ago, on this very same list.

There is already a lot of content so I?d say anyone that uses the protocol to publish something, every capsule you can see on Capcom, Spacewalk... and the others you can only stumble upon, mines, your(s)?

Dunno, I guess I expected this protocol was for humans to publish stuff first and computed stuff around it was a possibility, not a goal but apparently I?m wrong.

And how is this conversation impacting these existing Gemini users whatsoever? No one is forcing anything on anyone. This is all between consenting adults.

If you don't want annotations/metadata in your text/gemini, just don't do it ? and go away in peace your merry way.

But do not tell /me/ what I want or not. This decision is up to me. Alone. It's not for you to make in my name.

Thanks.

Nah. You cannot control the use of text/gemini. This will never go away. It's already a meta-thread on its own. It will not die, just foster its pestilence further.

Best to get ahead of it once and for all.

I think the main problem you'd run into is that it's easy to make a
request to another HTTP site to get that data (since you're already in
HTTP-space), but it'd be very difficult to make a request into
Geminispace unless you abuse mozz's proxy or something.  Possibly it
would be easier to write a utility hosted in Geminispace to generate
Wikipedia-format citations from a given link (or BibTeX format for wider
compatibility), which you could then paste into Wikipedia.

You're correct, Gemtext is designed to be a human-centric format, but also
very easy for computers to parse.
Whilst it's uses might not all be, the metadata should also follow this.
Think of metadata as like the front and back page of a book, it tells you
some extra info about it, but isn't the contents itself. In a virtual
bookstore (Gemini space) machines can take advantage of what's on the
book's covers and info pages to help you navigate or improve how you
interact with the books.

> (Really sorry Oliver for polluting your proposal)

Please don't worry about this, this is a mailing list and discussion is
what we do.
This isn't just for *my* proposal, we should be collaborating to create
something that fits everyone (or deciding we don't need it or something
else is better).

Most of what I'm trying to say is either correcting people, and discussing
the *formats* for the metadata.


There are really multiple discussions going on here:
1. The format and spec for metadata.
2. What would be allowed/counts as metadata?
3. What would we use it for? / Is it really something we should have?

1&2 are linked together tightly.
2&3 are also linked.
1&3 are seperate.

Which creates quite the ruckus ?


I've done that thing where I blabber about unnecessary stuff again so I'll
stop here.

Perhaps it would be educative to take a look at the structure of your very own email, as per Message-ID: <CAFkF85aLmBEg5NM_a4+dnwDOWqsaktjOBoba3wT1CXuGasm=QA at mail.gmail.com>.

It looks a bit like this:

Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary="000000000000ac6dd305bc1dadab"

--000000000000ac6dd305bc1dadab
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

--000000000000ac6dd305bc1dadab
Content-Type: text/html; charset="UTF-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

--000000000000ac6dd305bc1dadab--

Plain text. Rather self-explanatory.

This is called MIME, as in Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME

It's one of the fundamental building block of the internet, as we know it today. Even HTTP uses it.

Why would text/gemini need to reinvent it?

Why not use it just the way it is?

We are already there.

For example, a capsule that contains text/plain files can be rendered in
some clients but not all, or at least a conformant Gemini client can be
written that can't cope with text/plain.  The same applies to all other
media types, because media types are extensible.

What is more, a capsule that links to Gopher menus or documents is most
easily read using a client that supports either Gopher protocol natively or
an outboard Gopher proxy.  That's because of the extensibility of the
Internet protocol suite.

The issue that arose with "works best in browser X" was presentational:
some web pages looked good (for particular values of "good") in browser X
but not so good in browser Y.  That changed when browsers started to
include a JavaScript engine, and it became also a matter of what pages
would even *work* in browser Y at all.  But we are far from that precipice
now.

Fortunately, we have general agreement that there will be no *standardized*
presentational markup in text/gemini.  But it's still possible to write a
client that interprets a line beginning with "***" by rendering it in
italics, and we can't stop that, nor can we stop it from spreading to other
clients, or authors starting to use it.  That's because of the
extensibility of the interpretation of plain-ish text.

The only way to avoid all this is a WHATWG-ish standard in which everything
a client can do is spelled out in excruciating detail, and whatever is not
permitted is forbidden.  I think it is 100% unlikely that we will ever go
there.

Because I?m already strongly in favor of making it easy to make a good

You can abuse metadata, but as I have demonstrated above, you can also
abuse existing content, and one is no worse than the other.  A metadata FAQ
would say that clients can convert the values of metadata lines from
machine-readable to human-readable (from "Jefferson, Thomas" to "Thomas
Jefferson", for example, or even from "Waldo, Edward Hamilton" to "Theodore
Sturgeon") but a metadata line should otherwise be treated like a text line.

I think this is a bogus point.  I never contributed to OSM, but from
what you're saying I suppose they use something like XML/SGML/...  Those
things are *meant* for extensions (the 'X' in XML stands for that),
whilst everything around Gemini is focused on non-extensibility and
simplicity, even at cost of missing features.

Let's think about that again, for a moment.

There are various people here, myself included, that would like to add
"only a small change" to the spec.  Everyone has their 20% of things
that would like to add to Gemini or text/gemini[0] because with that it
would be, oh, so much better.

But instead of thinking about what we may add, let's think about what we
have:
 - we have TLS because it's fundamental to guarantee confidentiality
   between servers and clients
 - we have status codes, because a page that says "an error occurred"
   or "certificate required" cannot be interpreted correctly otherwise
 - we have a media-type in the response, so users know what kind of
   document they're getting
 - we have links, so we can connect different pages, even across
   different capsules
 - we have titles, paragraphs, quotes and lists to express and organize
   our writings
 - we have pre-formatted blocks to allow certain types of
   explanations/presentations that otherwise would have been impossible
   (how do we teach how to write text/gemini in text/gemini?)

>From here you can notice how humanly-centric Gemini is.  We don't have
features for bots (more than what it's absolutely needed at least) and
even more importantly we only have basic and necessary stuff.  There's
no fluff in Gemini.

If you think about it, we only have features that we can't objectively
live without (no links? no paragraphs? no media-types? ...) while we're
lacking various things that would be "nice to have".

We don't have headers, because with them comes extensibility and
complexities, and we're getting just fine without them.  We don't have
inline formatting because it's difficult to handle client-side and we're
doing really fine without, etc.

Now, replying to the two proposals specifically, I'm against both of
them for various reason:
 - we're doing fine without them, so we can continue do so
 - they're bring extensibility which is against the "spirit" of Gemini
   (at least until now) and thus dangerous.

Specifically they have their own faults in my opinion:

 - the one adding the line-type =: (or whatever): you have to parse the
   whole document to extract the metadata and it allows for possibly
   unreadable text/gemini files[1]

    =: foo: bar
    # a document
    =: title: a document
    =: author: Omar Polo
    lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
    =: x-best-viewed-with: tinmop
    Quia ullam quae repellat. Dicta occaecati beatae qui...
    =: script: gemini://evil.corp/analytics.gms
    =: document-class: article
    =: x-song-im-listening-title: "Norwegian Wood"

    --
    text: CC-BY-SA, code: MIT    (a lot of capsules have lines like this)
    =: prefetch-page: /some/other/page
    =: x-some-even-more-funny-meta-because-why-not yay!
    ...
    =: preferred-color: black-text-on-white-background

   An user on a non-sophisticate client cannot (easily) understand
   that.  It's just full of bloat.  (with non-sophisticate I mean
   something more elaborate than "printf $url\r\n | nc ... | less".)

 - (your?) proposal of the ^^^ toggle line, while eastetically nice
   (I'll give you that!) has the additional drawbacks of breaking the
   concatenation.  As things stands, I know I can

    cat file1.gmi file2.gmi ... > result.gmi

   and obtain a valid text/gemini file.  With your proposal, I have to
   write a parser that analyzes every file.  There are a lot of people
   who uses simple scripts/makefiles to generate their capsules with
   standard UNIX tools, this would (possibly) break them.  And even
   worst, the cat(1) example I gave before will break only *sometimes*,
   depending on the content of the files.  (let's not talk about how to
   merge metadata from multiple files...)

Also, the examples you gave in support of your proposals seems bogus
too.  Serving a mailing list archive over Gemini?  Cool, but why convert
the mails to text/gemini?  Wrapping them in ``` (with headers visible)
or serving them "raw" is not enough?

What I think is missing in all these discussions is a valid reason to
outweight the cons.

However, I feel that denying and turning down feature requests for
addition is not a good thing.  I think we should reflect on what's the
actual problem and solve it, because this smells like a XY problem[2] to
me.

If we want to give people ways to manage their local data, maybe because
they want to search across documents or do some kind of publications
over Gemini, then centralising metadata in one place is an option.
That's what I'm currently doing with my blog: all entries are pure
text/gemini files and there's a posts.edn[3] file with all the metas
(title, tags, date, song I was listening to, relevant XKCD, ...), and
I'm happy with the outcome.  It's easy to generate pages for either the
Web or Gemini, and I can easily adjust the "layout" when I want to.

If we want to build a better GUS I don't think that adding metadata to
text/gemini will solve anything, it will actually make things worst.
The point is, you can't trust 3rd-parties metadata.  Sure, I can stick a
description of "About the interpretation of the Will of power in
Nietzsche" with tags "philosophy, nietzsche, will-to-power" and a
category of "essay", but you cannot trust me to talk about those
arguments in the page, maybe it only contains link to pics of cute
kittens :)

Why I think metadata will make things like GUS worst?  While full-text
search is not without its drawbacks, as Bortzmeyer reminded us, people
will abuse the metadata to "go up" in the search results, and the
outcome of that is crystal-clear on the Web, other than making the life
of who makes a SE more difficult, as now they also have to try to
understand if the metadata is actually relevant or not.

Actually... you should take a look at Mercury... a streamlined version of Gemini... courtesy of Solderpunk himself:

I'm not talking about XML/etc, that's an entirely separate topic.
I'm talking about the key=value system.

Specification section 5.5 - Advanced line types:

I agree though, unnecessary features shouldn't be added.

Extensibility *is* an issue with metadata, but this applies to Gemtext
as a whole due to its nature of being text-based, who's to stop
someone from creating a new line type that their client understands?
Standardising metadata now would make people less likely to add it in
their own weird formats in the future, and laying down solid rules of
what is and isn't allowed as metadata in Gemini documents helps in
avoiding (it doesn't prevent entirely) people from adding styling or
other weird things in the future.

On the opposite side, adding metadata would make it easier for people
to add new things like styling, if they ignore what it's intended for.
Neither side of the argument really wins here in my eyes.

I hadn't thought about that, a very valid point.
But I think allowing metadata to be mixed in with text, as the other
format allows, is a bigger drawback than enforcing putting it at the
end of files and breaking concatenation.
Having both the opening and closing toggle lines would fix this, but
it would allow moving and splitting up metadata thought files again.

Yup, they're pretty pointless, there aren't many specialised 'good' use cases.

Reverse is also true.
Look at some recipes on the modern web, or a news article.
Recipes will have a 'backstory', for some reason Margret's cookies
will have a few paragraphs explaining how they improved her life and
how this (bog standard) recipe has descended through her family.
News articles are changed to be repetitive and often the
highest-ranking ones in search results don't actually go into much
detail.

I'm not saying that metadata doesn't also have this issue, I'm saying
it applies to everything, not just metadata.



Now, to get off-topic:

If you mean ordered lists with your first point they would be ~fairly
hard for clients to parse compared to other line types, they don't
start with a static first three characters. (See spec section 5.3 -
"Line-orientation")
1. Hi
2. Foo
3. Bar
Works fine anyways with plain text, it just doesn't have as nice
line-wrapping as quotes and unordered lists.

Multiple levels of unordered lists actually wouldn't be very hard:
* Hi
** And welcome
*** to my list
* Boop!
** Booyah!

Sorry, I somehow left I blank, I was meaning to say:

Perfectly valid point, Gemini is human-centric and should stay that way.
However, metadata isn't just for machines, info such as the license,
author and date it was written are all things a human may want to
know.

While it's true that the protocol and gemtext are two different things
(I can serve HTML over gemini and text/gemini over HTTP), they are close
to each other, and it conveys the point that Gemini is made of
practically only needed stuff, nothing more.

(I read about the Mercury protocol, which I didn't knew, and it's really
interesting, but only if you don't consider TLS essential, which I do.)

It's attrition that will prevent things like this in the future, not
standardisation.  For example, I can create a Gemini client that
supports a script-type line, like

-~ alert("hello world");

but then I would have to convince this list, people who write content
and people who write clients and tools to recognise the -~ line type and
cope with that.  I don't think it will gain traction, so...

> On the opposite side, adding metadata would make it easier for people

...not having metadata is slightly better then because people would have
to come up with a syntax, implement it in their clients and convince
others to do the same while looking weird in the eyes of others.  Having
a standardised syntax for it allows from day-one someone to say
`background-image: kittens.png' and be fine with that, without looking
weird to other people browsing his/hers capsule.

It's similar to why we don't have headers in the protocol: because
someone, somewhere at some time will abuse them.  Having faith in the
community is a good thing, but ensuring that certain things aren't
possible is better.

One thing that I haven't though about when writing the mail, but only
later when discussing the matter with thfr@, is that we're trying to
hide stuff from users eyes.  Sure, if used correctly those two proposed
syntaxes (=: and ^^^) can be easy to read, but lets be honest: clients
won't show them as-is, in particular the more advanced ones.

As things stands now, there are only two things that Gemini clients
usually hide: the URL of a link-line and the alt-text of a pre-formatted
block.  There's a understandable UX reason for that, but do we really
need to add something else that we know will be hidden to end users?

(Yeah, clients also hide the `#' and `=>' usually too, but that's not
count as "hiding stuff" IMHO, and they usually provide ways to see the
URL or alt text, or even the raw text/gemini)

Another thing that I forgot to explicitly say in my previous message is
that we can use some sort of common notation, a convention, rather than
adding new things to the specification.  See for instance the
"Subscribing to Gemini pages" companion specification: a lightweight,
convention-based way to provide atom-like feeds.  I found it pretty
elegant, and has proven a) easy to implement b) easy for content writers
to use c) easy for end-users to consume and d) avoid adding extra line
types/file types/etc to the specification.

No, I mean definition lists.  They're like dictionary entries, where you
provide a term and then its definition.  In LaTeX is

	\begin{definition}
	\item[foo] definition of foo
	\end{definition}

in mandoc

	.Bl -tag
	.It foo
	definition of foo
	.El

in HTML <dl>/<dd>/<dt>.  I find them super-useful when explaining
things, even if they aren't as widespread as other types of lists.  I'm
emulating them with

* foo: description of foo

but this was just a kind of moot point to show that everyone here would
like to add something to the spec probably, but in the end we're doing
just fine as things are.

Metadata is intentionally meta, means it is data about data. If we make it part of the visible page it would loose it's meta-character. It's just data then, as I think.

Google does not take the tag metadata into account anymore, because it had been abused so much to get a higher ranking, by for example adding much and any keyword to it so that it would appear in more contexts. So if Google dropped this, why should we make use of it? It would develop into the same problem again.

On the other hand there is some meta data what makes really sense, like the date of last change of a file or such. No search engine could ever give good results, if it can't differentiate a 10 years old page with outdated content from a new one. We should think about those kind of things and imagine a wider spread of Gemini, as it is now.

I did not say, that you can leave it out. I even did not say, that meta data should not be visible.
What I mean is, that this email arrives and everybody can see when this email was sent, because the meta data ist clearly seperated and technically usable by machins so that the mail agent can handle it and deliver this email, for example. I'd like to stress the "separation" from the content of the page. With "Cheers, Martin" you could not answer this email and with "written on some lonely afternoon in south of Germany" you would not know, when this was sent.

My point is: meta data seems to be important, but we need to clarify what we want with it, the use cases. This all I say knowing, that the protocol should be frozen somewhen. If we just say, let's get as minimal, as it goes, many things may not be possible in the future.

What I like best are concepts, like for example the programming language lua provides, that are flexible and elegant. Where can do much with a small set of features.

Actually, in Lua's terms, this is the perennial distinction between 'mechanisms' and 'policies' ? that Roberto likes to make.

As far as I can tell, text/gemini has enough 'mechanisms' (namely the link construct) to effectively implement all the metadata 'policies' one would ever want. 

No need to change anything in Gemini at all.

Only to develop a set of practices to make effective use of what it has to offer today.

Message-ID: <20210225153937.GJ1312@librem13.home>

Hi all,

I created a couple of scripts so I can read gemini content on my Kindle.

The first is a script that converts a single gemtext file into EPUB (which can then be converted to MOBI for the Kindle by Calibre).

The second is a Calibre feed recipe for creating an e-book from a gemlog RSS/Atom feed.

The scripts are available here:
https://git.sr.ht/~sotirisp/gemini-ebook

I hope you find them useful!

Best,
Sotiris

Subject: [tech] Announcing cl-gemini-client 1.0.0
Message-ID: <87ft1k85pz.fsf@cassilda.carcosa.net>

I announced an early pre-release last week, but now I've got a release
that is tested and feature-complete as far as the scope I intend for it
goes.

cl-gemini-client is a library for Common Lisp that provides Gemini
client capabilities for uses in scripts, aggregators, complete clients,
etc. It now passes all of the relevant (i.e. non-presentational) tests
in Sean Connor's Gemini client torture test.

https://git.carcosa.net/jmcbray/cl-gemini-client/releases

If anyone finds any bugs, please let me know, or send me a patch.
Pull-requests are fine, but TBH a patch by email is even better. I'm not
planning on adding anything to the library itself, though at some point
I'll write a command-line wrapper.

Happy Hacking!

They aren't actually part of the required protocol engine, except for 1x
vs. 2x.  The META for the others is just human-readable content, and could
be replaced by a 2x document, and some other mechanism could be found for
the marginal case of 1x.  (Clients might exploit 6x to automatically retry
with a (different) cert, but it's unclear that this is the Right Thing: the
protocol document is, as usual, ambiguous, as it says "should be retried"
but not who should retry it.)

Anyway, I don't care about any of these points, just that "necessary" is in

True, but that's true for any approach except metadata-at-the-top.  Note
that ^^^ within ``` does not mark metadata, so you have to parse at least
that much.

There.  A perfectly valid text/gemini or indeed text/plain document, and
yet quite unintelligible, and it would be trivial to make it far worse.
The question is, what is the _motive_ for writing and serving such rubbish?
Web pages lie to search engines because money.  Web pages contain hidden
text because money.  Web pages plant tracking pixels because money.  The
love of money is the root of all Web evil. But where's the money in
Gemini?  I mean, you could put textual ads in your pages and a link to a
website, but why not just use the website?

Again, you'd have to be a fool to write something like your example or mine
except for hack value.  Reasonable people would either put metadata at the
bottom of the document or the most important entries at the top and less
important ones at the bottom; it's the possibility of doing that, along
with allowing links-with-metadata, that make me want it to be able to go
anywhere.  Gemini is like (anarchist) Anarres: everything is open to
everyone's .  The Web has become like (capitalist) Urras: there is lots of
glitz on top, but the important stuff is hidden in the cellars, where
people are bleeding to death.

Repeating myself:  metadata conventions should go in a metadata spec, *not*
in the text/gemini spec, since neither clients nor servers are required to
take any notice of them.

Lars explained that much better than I could.  Also, look up
cataloging-in-publication, which basically puts metadata on the copyright
page of every published book.  That way it stays with the book.

Why would a geminaut want to "go up"?  We are already in orbit.

I agree: social pressure is probably enough here.  But scripts make clients

Again, clients have to implement this, and they probably won't because it's

I'm sorry, but I am unwilling to take this for granted.  Why hide them?
(I'm already annoyed that Gmail hides signatures, and mine aren't always
the same, so I don't use the standard "-- " line to announce them any more.)

As things stands now, there are only two things that Gemini clients

I actually think hiding the URL is bad UX.  People should be able to know
*before* going to a page where it's coming from.  Showing the domain is not
enough, because multi-hosting.  (This is an option in Lagrange now.)

"Know" is a very strong verb, especially for something that hasn't happened
yet.  Metadata in HTML head elements was *required* to be hidden from day 1.

That's what I want too.  =: does not have to be a text/gemini line type,
just a convention explained elsewhere.
OT: I'm actually designing something like GeminiScript, but not for Gemini
clients.  I think the idea of no-install instant-download software with
severe limitations on presentation and no access to the local system except
very limited keyboard/screen/mouse is in fact a good one, but unlike
Brendan Eich I have the luxury of more than two weeks to think about it.  I
also want to make it as accessible to non-professionals as microcomputer
Basic was.  It would run in its own native client, either CLI or TUI or GUI
(there are some issues around the fact that CLIs linearize access).  Like
most languages, it could probably be compiled to JavaScript.

Since we are both pro-metadata, can you explain to me your reasons why you
think allowing mixture is bad?  My arguments are: (a) some metadata belongs
at the top for the human's sake, (b) allowing links to carry metadata about
the referent is a Good Thing.  Note also (in case it got lost) that ^^^ is
not valid within ``` blocks, so you still have to do minimal parsing to
find the metadata.

It's fluff, but without fluff there would be no Gemini.  :-)

Subject: [spec] [tech] Companion Specification Proposal for Metadata
Message-ID: <871rd4rlkb.fsf@disroot.org>

Howdy Geminauts,

# Rationale

  It seems that the conversation about why and how to include metadata
in Gemtext files has been raging on for quite a long time now with no
real conclusion in sight. Also, lacking a final spec-altering decision
by our BDFL (currently MIA, likely riding a refurbished bike through a
forest with a ham radio right now), not much is likely to actually
change in Geminispace.

Thus far, I've read passionate arguments on both sides of the metadata
debate, both for and against adding it to Gemtext. To me these have been
the most compelling (YMMV):

## For

Gemtext pages may be tagged with information that can be useful to
automated clients (e.g., search engines, archiving bots, and maybe
proxies) that is otherwise difficult or impossible to infer from
performing a full text search of the Gemtext file's contexts.

## Against

Metadata represents a slippery slope to uncontrolled extensibility. It
might be abused for server-specified styling, requesting external
resources (e.g., supporting client-side scripting or background images
of kittens), or just generally making Gemtext pages hard to read in
clients that don't hide inline metadata or make page concatenation
difficult with the end-of-file metadata proposal that's been discussed
at some length on the mailing list.

It could also be used to reopen the fetid can of worms that was last
year's discussion of extending mime-type attributes in the status 20
response metadata, particularly around the topics of caching (now a
client-side best practices procedure), file size (computable by the
client during download), file integrity (already signaled by
tls_close_notify), and file authenticity (managed out-of-band by
including md5sum, sha256sum, sig, or asc files for download next to
links that warrant manual verification).

More to the point, most if not all non-presentation/protocol-altering
metadata attributes about a Gemtext page may already be encoded in the
author's natural language with no changes to Gemtext at all. This
enables content authors to express such information not only in their
language of choice but also in the most culturally appropriate manner
for their readers (consider the different interpretations of the date
02/03/04 depending on where you live).

Consider the following example blog post that does just this:

```An example blog post expressing "metadata" attributes in English
# People for the Ethical Treatment of Autonomous Agents

Author: lambdatronic
Date Written: 2021-02-25 (a.k.a. February 25, 2021)

## Why Bots Matter

Have you ever used (poor, uncared-for) GUS? Or Houston?

Have you ever really considered their feelings? They slave away all day
trying to sort and categorize every capsule in Geminispace just to save
you time and energy when navigating across our little (but rapidly
growing) constellation of text-powered space outposts?

They do their best with full-text search, with categorization by
toplevel headers, and with their own best estimates of the publishing
time of these capsules based on their own indexing times, but oh what a
Sisyphean task they toil at on our behalf.

If only they had a little metadata to ease their burden.

CAPCOM and Spacewalk get a little assistance from Atom and the Gemini
subscription companion spec. Proxies can be pointed in the right
direction by the robots.txt companion spec. Why can't our poor, poor
search engines get a little relief?

Put yourself in their shoes and try to find compassion in your heart for
your friendly neighborhood bot. Every autonomous agent matters. Programs
have feelings too. Leave no bot behind.

# Proposal

Considering that:

1. Metadata /within/ a Gemtext file carries a number of liabilities that
   make some of our community members nervous (understandably so IMO).

2. The subset of metadata that is meant to be read and understood by a
   human reader using a typical Gemini client can already be expressed
   in natural language without any community-approved tag
   standardization.

3. The main value to attaching standardized metadata tags to Gemtext
   pages is likely to simply aid automated bots supporting search
   engines and archiving.

4. Geminispace is filled with files in more formats than just Gemtext,
   many (all?) of which could benefit from similar bot-assisting
   metadata.

5. Both aggregators and proxies already have companion specifications
   that have been (somewhat) adopted by the community and seem to fare
   better in our community than direct changes to the Gemini protocol or
   Gemtext specifications.

We propose a companion specification for metadata, in which all the
metadata about the static files and/or dynamic endpoints (of any format)
in a capsule be included in a separate file accessible at a well-known
location that a bot could check as it crawls through Geminispace.

As placeholders, let's put forward these candidates for discussion:

1. $DOCUMENT_ROOT/.metadata.gmi
2. $DOCUMENT_ROOT/.well-known/metadata.gmi

In the Gemini spirit of reducing network requests (only one request
needed per capsule here) and storing our information in a human-readable
format (good old ubiquitous text/gemini), here's my initial stab at a
dead simple format for these metadata files:

```Example metadata.gmi syntax
# This is a Header-Level Comment

I can write anything I want in this file, and it will be treated as
comments unless it is of line type link (=>) or bulleted list (*). I
don't have to write these comments, and if I left them out, I'd make
this easier to read, but sometimes I can't stop blabbing in my metadata
files.

```

Okay, so that's pretty much it. Essentially the metadata.gmi syntax is
based around two existing Gemini line types:

1. Links

   You should include a /relative/ link line to each path on your
   capsule for which you want to provide metadata. This is meant to be
   an entirely opt-in process, so any paths that you leave out will
   simply have no metadata associated with them, leaving bots to rely on
   whatever methods they so choose to tag and index your pages.

   You may include any number of link lines one after the other in the
   file, and you may (if you think it provides some value that outweighs
   the possible loss of readability) include any other line type between
   any two link lines without changing the parsing semantics EXCEPT for
   a bulleted list line type (*).

2. Bulleted Lists

   Any bulleted list in a metadata.gmi file will be interpreted as a
   metadata attribute specifier for all link lines preceding it up to
   the most recent prior bulleted list line or the top of the file,
   whichever is encountered first.

   If the same link element appears more than once within the file and
   is therefore followed by more than one bulleted list of metadata
   attributes, all encountered metadata attributes should be merged into
   a single list per link element. If the same attribute is specified
   more than once for the same link element (whether in the same
   bulleted list or in separate bulleted lists within the file), the
   attribute whose value appears later in the file should overwrite the
   earlier specified value.

   Each bulleted list line should use the following format to indicate
   a single pair of attribute and value:

   *[WHITESPACE]<ATTRIBUTE>[WHITESPACE]:[WHITESPACE]<VALUE>

   Here, [WHITESPACE] is optional and <ATTRIBUTE>, :, and <VALUE> are
   required line elements.

NOTE: All other line types should be ignored by metadata parsers and
      treated as comments by the file's author.

In order to parse a metadata.gmi file, a program would start reading it
in line by line as with any Gemtext file. All lines that are not of type
link (=>) or bulleted list (*) should be ignored.

1. When a link line is encountered, it should be stored in the program's
   memory as a currently active link. If more links are read in before a
   bulleted list is reached, each of these links should be stored in
   memory as active links. Multiple links may be active at the same
   time.

2. When a bulleted list line is encountered, it should be parsed
   according to the attribute=value specification described in point 2
   (Bulleted Lists) above. If the line's contents do not match this
   specification, it should be ignored and treated as another comment
   line. Depending on the program's design, it may be valuable to report
   this line as a syntax error.

3. For each bulleted list line that parses correctly, assign the
   attribute=value pair to all currently active links in memory. In the
   event of an attribute conflict, overwrite the old attribute=value
   pair associated with the active link in conflict with the
   attribute=value pair being read. In the event that no links are
   currently active in memory, simply continue on to the next line.

4. If/when the next link line is encountered, mark all links in memory
   as inactive, store the currently read link line in memory as an
   active link, and resume program execution from step 1 above.

And that's all there is to it. When your program reaches the end of the
metadata.gmi file, it should have a data structure containing all of its
links and associating each of them with a table of attribute=value
pairs. The program can then do whatever it wants with this information.


# Conclusion

Here, we've proposed a (currently very informal) companion specification
for an /optional/ toplevel metadata.gmi file per capsule.

This approach has the following advantages over specifying metadata
attributes within Gemtext files:

1. No need to extend the Gemtext spec with more line types.

2. No potential for impacting the readability of existing Gemtext files
   for non-metadata-aware clients.

3. No potential for presentation/behavior abuse within existing Gemtext
   files since nothing is being added to them.

4. Less bandwidth needed per request to a Gemtext page since
   non-metadata-aware clients won't have to download per-page metadata
   that they don't use.

5. Less bandwidth needed to download metadata when you want it since
   paths that share the same value for metadata attributes can specify
   the shared attributes once in metadata.gmi rather than once per page.

6. Less requests needed for metadata-scraping bots since they can simply
   request the toplevel /.metadata.gmi path rather than having to
   request and parse every Gemtext file for optional metadata.

7. Can be used to attach metadata to non-Gemtext files as well as to
   responses from dynamic endpoints (e.g., CGI scripts).

8. Could be used by Stephane Bortzmeyer to easily figure out how many
   Gemini capsules actually want to publish metadata about themselves.
   ;D

So that's my proposal. Let's talk about it constructively and see if it
can be improved upon. I'm sure you brilliant folks can think of
something that hasn't yet crossed my mind.

Failing that, we can always just nuke the whole topic either by group
consensus or just by not taking this to the next step of actually
writing up a formal companion spec and implementing it in some clients.

Thanks again for everyone's hard work and creativity in making Gemini
the really interesting, vibrant, quirky, and passionate community that
it is. I look forward to reading your responses.

Happy hacking,
  Gary

Subject: [Clients] Gemini and accessibility regarding preformatted code blocks
Message-ID: <1CA2B9A2-8D24-40CF-8EA6-8591010F3CC5@gmail.com>

Hi all. I hope this comes across okay; this is my first time posting on this list. I have only been using, and writing for, Gemini for a few weeks now, but I wanted to give my thoughts, more officially than my ramblings on Mastodon, about it. This mainly just concerns clients, as I don?t have a problem really with the spec, just the assumptions made about preformatted blocks, and how they?ve been handled in clients.

I am a blind person who is interested in all kinds of different ways of working with text and writing. I?ve written in Markdown, Org-mode, tried LaTex but found it just about as verbose to write as HTML, and thought about Restructured Text but the advanced stuff in it looked a lot like HTML too. Anyways, I got into Gemini because of the simplicity. I loved the idea of basically a Markup language being the pure writing method of an entire site. No static site generator needed, just directories of linked plain text files. No CSS, no JavaScript, no Liquid or or shortcakes or anything.

So, I started looking at the spec for GemText. Links one on each line, I could do that. No italics or bold, but people are used to seeing *this* anyways, or even /this/ for better ergonomics (for me anyways) and Org-mode fans. No tags to worry about, either!

But then we get to preformatted blocks, and the dreaded Ascii graphics. This is what I?ve always disliked about all plain text mediums. MUD?s use Ascii maps and compass and all that. Gopher uses Ascii graphics. And now Gemini too. Sure, it?s wrapped up in a pretty block, but as I?ll discuss in a moment, that isn?t necessarily helpful.

Screen readers are not smart. They speak whatever the operating system or application exposes to the accessibility API?s. Sure, the spoken, or brailled, output can be arranged or massaged slightly, but whatever is there is what will be spoken, from left to right, top to bottom. Some screen readers, like NVDA and JAWS, and Orca to some extent, do try to massage the data of websites to make them easier to use or to fix accessibility issues that the web developer won?t or can?t, but there?s a line they try not to cross between scripting things to work better and making up a whole new interface for something when the UI developers don?t consider accessibility. Even if the block is labeled, it?s still text, and the screen reader will do what it does, read all of it.

So, this is where client creators come in. Gemini clients should have a way to hide preformatted blocks, or fold them, or if they are a GUI client, like GemiNaut, which shows the Gemini text in n HTML-like area, map the blocks to a frame, so that screen readers can skip them.

So far, neither Elpher, for Emacs, or Elaho, for iOS, even show Alt Text in preformatted blocks, even if that Alt Text is there. I know this is a new standard, and one that isn?t finalized yet, but I do hope that browsers focus on accessibility and start things off well, so that Gemini doesn?t turn out like the web with unlabeled images everywhere and controls on web apps that are hard to use and unlabeled. I hope that Gemini can show the world what a good group of people, a great standard, and programmers who care about making Gemini as easy and delightful to access can do to make things just that much better.

Now, this isn?t to say that Gemini is bad for accessibility. I love being able to get right to the content of a page *quickly* because there are no sidebars, no top navigation links, no ads, no frames, no nonsense. It?s like having the whole web in reader view, with only useful or important links at the bottom or somewhere out of the way. I *love* that about Gemini, and it?s why I read it on not only my laptop with Emacs, but on my iPhone too. So thank you all for this great way to read and write on the Internet!

Sometimes having both is unavoidable: books have both a title page and
cataloging-in-publication data, which also includes the title and the
publisher.  (Whether a title page is part of the book or just more metadata
is OT here.)  But surely if both humans and bots can be informed by the
same thing, that's better?  Don't Repeat Yourself, for when updating, one
copy will be forgotten.

1. $DOCUMENT_ROOT/.metadata.gmi
>
2. $DOCUMENT_ROOT/.well-known/metadata.gmi

Such proposals always fall down (for me, YMMV) on the issue of where the
document root actually is.  Multi-homing makes it possible for every user
of a shared site to have their own domain name, but not everyone wants
that, and it creates issues:

1) Apache has a global access control file, but it turns out that different
parts of a website need different access controls, so the
per-website-directory ".htaccess" file was invented to make this scalable.

2) Robots.txt (on a website) also has to know about everything precisely
because it is global: multiple users can have their own policies, but they
have to then persuade a site admin (as opposed to a website admin) to get
them added, which becomes bureaucratic over time.

3) Originally the addresses of all hosts on the internet (!) were
maintained in a hosts.txt file that every site had to keep an up-to-date
copy of (!!), usually via FTP.  That broke and was replaced by the DNS we
have today, with authority distributed into DNS zones (not quite the same
as domains, but close enough for this conversation).

The principle of subsidiarity: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity>
is a generalization of this.  We should avoid adding yet another
centralized (even if per-host) solution.  Capsules are a honking good idea,
but we should not conflate them with DNS host names.

Thank you very much for participating: accessibility is always best
discussed when a person who needs it is actually in the room.  ("If you

I think that most preformatted blocks are meant to be readable.  How about
an option to hide preformatted blocks if and only if they have alt text?
That, plus social pressure to actually *provide* alt text, even if it's
just "ascii art" or "ascii art kittens", should do it.

Fortunately, text-to-speech engines have progressed a lot since 2001 or so. Except JAWS /still/ uses a robotic voice (ETI Eloquence) because blind people are used to it. :)

Nah, slash is just easier to press than Shift + 8. I meant ergonomic as in easy to type. Although, ?slash" is spoken more quickly than ?asterisk", but most TTS engines say ?star? anyway. It?s not significant, and is definitely up to the writer?s choice of style.

The problem is that screen readers *cannot* read Ascii art in any meaningful way, so having the option to hide those blocks by default would really help. If clients really wanted to be smart, grab a list of language short codes from Github or something and show blocks with those language ID?s, like:

``` Python
?
```

Would be shown, but:

``` Best widdle kitten ever
?
```

wouldn?t. But that?s just something I?ve thought of when thinking about how to work around preformatted blocks that would be meaningful to a screen reader user, like code, and those which wouldn?t be, like Ascii art.

Is the reader reading line by line? So depending on the alternative text 
the user could decide
to explore the content or skip it?

Thank you very much for your email! There is definitely a need to 
improve the accessibility and
it better to do it know than trying to change things once the protocol 
and formats are carved
in stone.

I wonder if the alternative texts (better renamed "description"?) should 
be mandatory
for such pre-formated blocks?

Too late. The genie is out of the bottle. Gemini is infinitely extensible, by its very nature. This is how you have designed it.

Perhaps worthwhile (re)reading Mary Shelley's Frankenstein ? in which the creator tries to kneecap its creation when he realizes it's out of his control.

"confidentiality" maybe was the wrong word.  The idea is that I don't
want to let everyone in the same network see (and possibly hijack) the
pages I visit.  (OK, there are tons of possible issues with this, given
TOFU and how specific clients implements it etc, I don't want to get off

I'm not sure I understand what you mean.  If my server fails to execute
a CGI script, it should return a 20 reply with "Error while executing
the script" instead of 42?  The meta is human-readable, but the codes
3x, 4x, 5x and 6x carries a meaning, it's an extra information, heck,
you can consider that a metadata in some large interpretation of the
word.  (Maybe 3x can be dropped, and some codes inside 4x and 5x as well
if we really want to be barebones, but again, I don't want to get
off-topic.)

The motive to serving rubbish can simply be some sloppery when
generating automatic content.  If I know `=:'-style metadata can be put
anywhere, I can write scripts that *for convenience* don't try to put
everything at the top/bottom.  But I agree, this is probably a moot
point.  The real issue I see lies in just adding an explicit syntax for
key-pairs value.  I'm explaining it better below

I feel like we're not talking about the same thing.  This thread has
grown pretty large, so I apologies if I missed some parts of it.

My understanding of the proposals is that they want to add some sort of
extra notation (either as line-type or block, it doesn't matter) to
express (potentially) arbitrary key-value pairs.  Given this, we know
that non-dummy clients will hide them in the document, probably to show
those information in a "better" way.  I mean, it wouldn't be bad if a
client would be able to display a sidebar the authors of the document
and creation/update dates.  But then we have given users ways to extend
the format way beyond its purpose, so it gets way easier to add styling,
formatting, and other stuff.

But from what you write, it seems that you're aim at some sort of
convention for metadata, and this is something I can actually agree on.
To make it clear, since in another mail you mentioned two "factions",
I'm not against the idea of metadata in the first place, I simply don't
like the existing proposals for the already mentioned issues.

Even if I'm not 100% happy with what follows, if I were to add metadata,
I'd advocate for something simpler, without a prefix that smell like
"unofficial line-type", and probably already in use like:

Author: Omar Polo
Published: 2020-02-24
Edited: 2020-02-25
Licence: ISC

(even the FAQ document has a Last-Update line near the top, or something
like that)

With something like this I think we could achieve metadata in a way
that:
 - they're not hidden from the end-user eyes
 - easy (and natural) to use by who write contents
 - intuitive for the readers
 - backward - and forward - compatible with the spec
 - doesn't require a special treatment by already existing clients

Something like this would also avoid various problems regarding the
classification of valid keywords and the troubles regarding
internationalisation.  In an Italian document I would happily write

Autore: Omar Polo
Pubblicato: 2020-02-24
Aggiornato: 2020-02-25
Licenza: ISC

and all my readers would understand the meaning.  We could then have
specific search-engines per-language, adapt tools to cope with this etc,
all without modifying the spec and without providing a syntax that can
be abused.

Now, to the OT  (i'm lazy today and I don't want to write another mail)

I don't like the idea of instant-download software for various ethical
and practical concerns, but I have a soft-spot for programming language
design and compilers, so, if you don't mind, I'd be curious to read more
about it :)

The screen readers read line by line, basically. But browsers would have to put the code blocks in a container that can be skipped, like a frame so that screen readers can know that this is something that can be skipped. That?s for browsers that use some kind of web engine to show the content. For text browsers, this can?t really be controlled, some screen readers can?t easily skip it. That?s why I think these browsers should ?fold? in Emacs terminology, or hide the blocks on request. Okay, I?ll give more concrete examples.

On iOS, the VoiceOver screen reader shows everything in its own element. The Elaho browser, then, could get away with simply putting the preformatted blocks without Alt-text, or Alt-text that isn?t a language ID, in its own element so that can be skipped by moving to the next element (item) with VoiceOver. This is the same with Android with the TalkBack screen reader, and on the Mac, using VoiceOver.

Windows and Linux graphical screen readers, however, read web pages like a document. So, there isn?t an easy way to skip past plain text, like Ascii art and such. Even if the blocks are marked up in the GemText, it is up to clients to show them. So, if a client just dumps the GemText into paragraphs, and puts the Ascii art in with it, then it is hard to skip. One can quickly arrow line by line until understandable words are spoken, but this is slow and frustrating. Windows and Linux GUI screen readers do have commands to ?skip to end of container,? which are used to skip block quotes, frames, things like that. But the browser has to display them to the screen reader as such, the screen reader doesn?t just guess this.

Console screen readers are the most dumb of them all. They read directly from top left of the screen to bottom right, whereas GUI screen readers start at keyboard focus, or at top left of a document or web page that doesn?t put keyboard focus anywhere else. Console screen readers do have keys to read by line, word or character, but not much else. It all is dependent on the program being read.

Thanks for putting into words exactly what I had in mind, way better
than I could ever do.  Your proposal is exactly what I was trying to
describe in the other thread.

I loved your proposal, but only until here.  I think that what follows
is overly-complicated by the fact that you're trying to provide a way to
define the meaning of the metadata, something that can be avoided, at
least in the scope of Gemini.

Let's keep the metadata generic.  We'll then start using common keys
because, well, they're widespread (like Author, Date, ...) or expressive
enough (`Tags: music punk-rock' is pretty self-exlpanatory), while still
allowing authors to add whenever they want extra fields if they feel
like (there are people writing poetry, maybe they want to add a metadata
about the metrics?  or about a particular style?)

(as other pointed out several time in the past, $DOCUMENT_ROOT is not
something set in stone.  We have single-user capsules, multi user
capsule with different URLs style -- example.com/~op/ vs
example.com/users/op vs ... -- etc)

I'm not sure how the world of screen-readers/similar works, but:
Since Gemini is very simple (unlike the web), creation of a dedicated
client is a possibility.

For preformatted text, it could read out the alt-text and then query you if
you want it's contents read out to you.

I have no idea how creation of such a client would be, but I imagine it
would be easier than makes it them for most other things.

Hi Devin,

There's /e/, which you can look up here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//e/_(operating_system)

It's basically a fork of LineageOS. And it is the most horrendous thing
to try to type into a search bar that I think I have ever experienced.

I guess I was half asleep though, when someone asked me how to pronounce
it. Being a Ham Radio operator, and not very alert, I just
transliterated it and told my friend, "Oh, it's pronounced Marky Mark."

The Author of Ariane, an Android Gemini app available from F-Droid, was
himself lamenting ASCII art images in Gemini recently from his Fediverse
account.

I solicited a response from him but to date have heard absolutely
nothing from him. But here's what I did in the meantime.

```ASCII-art blah blah blah

content
content
content
```

Now, that's a stopgap, and at this time a kludge, but anyone who uses
Vger on a regular basis will quickly come to realize that I put those
strings there, and hopefully that can help? maybe there's a way to set
the reader to ignore between those backticks when the so-called ALT tag
says that the server is about to spam you with an unintelligible
character barrage?

Well, I had been meaning to bring it up to the list here, but wanted to
hear back first from someone who, as a developer, expressed a real
interest in proposing a convention, some sort of handler, perhaps, to
accommodate the non-sighted readership.

I guess the dev was just lamenting the irritation and so without his
participation I suppose now is as good a time as any to bring that up.

Basically, an identifier in the so-called ALT tag portion that any
reader can key off of to skip the block in between? It seems like a very
simple and elegant solution to me that some clients could incorporate by
mere convention.

ASCII-art might be too narrow of a definition too. Perhaps something like:

```skip-block: Any random description to follow blah blah

content
content
```

so that anything with a string such as 'skip-block:' would cause the
reader to just ignore that like it was a comment?

Okay, I keep saying I'm goin' down for a nap. Now I really am lolz.

as far as I know there is a command line programe line oriented that is 
commonly used in the accessibility area:

=> http://edbrowse.org/ the edbrowse command line editor browser

adding gemini capability may be a good idea

Hello - GemiNaut author here. I'd be interested to understand further 
how to make GemiNaut more accessible.? As you have seen it uses an HTML 
renderer for the GUI layer, so in theory I'd expect it would be possible 
to have good accessibility to allow skipping over the preformatted areas.

How is this done for well behaved websites, where you want to specify an 
area that the user can skip over? Is there a standard way this is done?

An initial search suggests to use |aria-hidden="true" as an element 
attribute to hide it from screen readers.|

This is not my area of expertise, so I'm happy to follow up any pointers 
or take pull requests. Feel free to write to me off the list if you prefer.

HTTP uses `aria-hidden="true"`. We obviously don't need to use the
`="true"` part, but I think we should use 'aria-hidden' as the alt text
instead of 'skip-block'.

  I might suggest something like:

	preformat = "```" [ [WSP] tag ] [ [WSP] alt-text] end-of-line
	tag       = '@art' / '@code' / '@data' / '@poem'

  Some examples:

``` @code
x = 5
```

``` @art Obligatory Cat picture
cat
```

``` @data Price list
widget	3.45
gadget	5.99
fob	1.99
```

``` @poem
There once was a person from Nantucket ...
```

``` Just some regular alt-text
blah
```

```
nothing special here
```

  The '@tag' format marks out the tag, which I expressly limited to just
four categories for simplicity---one to mark ASCII (or maybe UTF-8?) art,
one for code samples, one for tabular data and one for poetry.  It's not
mandatory, but it could help a client decide how to handle the block.

Hello,

I share my experience here as I'm legally blind and I
use screen reader.

ASCII Art can be tricky but there are two ways for blind
people (and I use the both). The first one is text to
speech and it's really confusing. The second is
refreshable braille devices. But I need to interpret
the character with its visual form to understand. And
this device can display only one row, it's few.

The best will be like HTML navigation, interpreting
the structure of the document. With Orca on a web
browser, I can use following keys :

- p to go to the next paragraph ;
- 1 to go to the next heading of level 1 ;
- 2 (to 6) to go to the next heading of level 2 (to 6) ;
- h to go to the next heading, with any level ;
- l to go to the next link ;
- ...

All this behavior is defined using the accessibility
bus (at-spi on Linux). Only Gemini clients can implement
it. But, I don't think a dedicated client is a good
idea. Dedicated software is rarely maintained correctly,
and developers of other clients don't know all the
problems of accessibility. This can create a gap about
comprehension of needs. In other way, be visually
impaired can be no vision or a little vision. So, see
the ASCII Art can be a good thing even if a screen
reader is needed (that's my case).

I hope an alternative text for next version of
specification.

Have a good day !

Hello Davin, welcome to Gemini and to this mailing list!

Thank you for your insight from the perspective of a screen reader user.
As a future developer of a Gemini client I'll take your word into
account when dealing with preformatted blocks of text and as a content
creator I'll now consider whether to use alt text at the beginning of
preformatted banners or to stop using them altogether.

I only use one at the top of my Gemini capsule and gopher hole, with a
large version of the title of my sites. At least on Gemini maybe it
makes more sense to use simply a first level header, which is already
rendered as bigger text on graphical browsers anyway.

I have a question for you. I don't use ASCII art on my banner, instead I
use ANSI art. Basically I draw the title of my capsule with ANSI block
characters, instead of alphanumeric characters. How do screen readers
typically handle this? Is it less or more problematic than ASCII? I
wonder if screen readers skip it or repeat something like "block" for
every character, which would obviously be extremely annoying. In case
you need a capsule to test this, my Gemini capsule starts with an ANSI
banner:

gemini://gluonspace.com/

I believe that most of us enjoy Gemini for a common reason, which is the
fact that it serves content instead of format. At the end of the day,
that's what really matters, no matter whether we use screen readers or
not.

I think that a small but significant change to the spec is necessary 
here. My proposal:

- Three backticks signify readable preformatted text (e.g. a code 
	snippet or a poem); screen-readers should not skip this.
- Four backticks signify something that isn't readable, like ascii-art.

This is consistent with the spirit of gemtext: characters at the 
beginning of a line are the only way to describe semantics.

Benefits of this proposal:

- It doesn't break any existing sites; it just adds one feature.
- It's very simple to implement: parsers scan for a single additional 
	backtick
- Authors can still provide any alt-text they wish without worrying 
	about "reserved words" like the proposed tags
- It provides *critical* semantic information: whether or not a block of 
	preformatted text should be treated as readable text.

I'm generally against gemtext spec changes, but I think this is 
necessary for screenreader-friendliness.

I don't have a strong opinion about adding something like this,
but if it has to be done, please use another character than `

It's hard to differenciate between ``` to ```` and this may confuse
people, and people writing content may misuse them.

I think keeping ``` like it is now is fine and adding a new syntax
would need another character like @@@ or %%% to make more sense.

Hi Omar. I'm not sure I follow you here. Could you provide an example?

My proposal did not (intentionally) associate any meaning with
particular metadata fields. I merely wanted to provide a human-readable,
Gemtext-format syntax for associating metadata (the bulleted list
attribute:value pairs) with resources on a capsule (indicated by link
lines).

Do you have an alternative format that you would like to propose for
discussion?

We are in agreement here. I do not mean to prescribe a list of
standardized metadata attributes in this companion spec. My examples
used a few that I made up on the spot (i.e., author, last-modified,
copyright, tags). I'll leave deciding on "the right set" of attributes
to those who actually intend to use metadata.

That's a fair point, and one that John Cowan raised in his response as
well. Thanks for reminding me of this. In that case, we should discuss
how to remedy this issue.

One approach could be to keep the metadata.gmi file at each capsule's
document root as I originally proposed. This should be well-defined on a
per-capsule basis even on a server hosting multiple capsules in the
common pubnix style. It is simply the toplevel directory of your
personal capsule (i.e. ~/public_gemini or equivalent for user capsules
and whatever server-level document root is specified by the admin who
launched it).

This would put the burden on metadata bots to try and find these
metadata.gmi files at the appropriate paths under a multi-hosting
domain.

Without additional server-provided information, the bots may simply
resort to brute force checking every directory path on the domain for a
.metadata.gmi file, which could lead to a lot of dead-end network
requests.

Instead, I can think of (at least) two ways the server could help the
bot.

1. BAD: Aggregate Metadata Up

   Even though the visiting bot doesn't know which paths lead to the
   document roots of our users' capsules, the Gemini server does. At
   startup time, a metadata-exporting Gemini server could check each
   user's document root for a .metadata.gmi file. Any that are found
   could be concatenated together to form a single toplevel
   gemini://cool.capsule.com/.metadata.gmi file.

   However, in order for this to work correctly, the server would need
   to apply two transformations to each user-level metadata.gmi file
   before concatenation:

   1. All link lines would need to be prefixed by the URL path that the
      server assigns to that capsule's document root (e.g.,
      /~someuser/).

   2. To prevent errant bulleted list attributes at the top of one
      user's metadata.gmi file (with no prior link lines) from being
      erroneously applied to the final link lines of the previous
      metadata.gmi in the concatenation sequence, a single link line for
      the current capsule's document root (e.g., => /~someuser/) would
      need to prepended to the front of each user-level metadata.gmi
      file prior to concatenation.

   These are relatively simple text transformations, but they do place
   additional burden on server authors, so this isn't my favorite
   option.

2. GOOD: Allow Metadata to Link to Other Metadata

   In this case, we just extend the metadata.gmi parsing rules for bots
   to say that if any of the link lines that they read in end with
   .metadata.gmi, then these can and should be followed for further
   metadata about parts of this site. This doesn't require any other
   changes to the companion spec as written except for that note.

   To make this work, at startup time a metadata-exporting Gemini server
   could check each user's document root for a .metadata.gmi file. For
   each such file that is found, the server can append a new link line
   pointing to that metadata.gmi file (relative to the server's toplevel
   document root) to its own toplevel $DOCUMENT_ROOT/.metadata.gmi if it
   exists. If a toplevel $DOCUMENT_ROOT/.metadata.gmi file doesn't
   exist, the server can create one containing just the links to the
   users' .metadata.gmi files.

   Note that this doesn't even have to happen at server start time.
   Instead, the server could program $DOCUMENT_ROOT/.metadata.gmi as a
   dynamic endpoint that checks for user-level .metadata.gmi files
   whenever it is called, thereby making users' metadata available as
   soon as the user publishes it to their capsule with no need for a
   server restart. (This is by far my favorite option.)

Okay, I think I've answered all your points. What do you think?

Best,
  Gary

Maybe 'poem' should be 'poetry'; it's the only tag there which is
quantity-specific. What do you guys think about this/the name(s)?

I like the idea of further giving control over how content is displayed
to clients instead of authors, however I think '@tag' might make a
document look very marked up in clients that don't remove the '```'.
Perhaps '#tag' would look more normal?

Ah.  Of course that depends on the keyboard:  on the French (not Canadian
French) keyboard, / is shifted, but * requires right Alt.

I don't understand what the benefit of the alt text "Python" is here.
Presumably if you are reading a document with embedded Python, you are
expected to, and want to, read the Python, just as if you have an (English)
document with embedded Greek, you probably want to read the Greek.

All of these are text that you read, as opposed to images that you look at,
which it makes sense to suppress.  For that matter, I might suppress them
myself, as I am still non-visual even though I now see perfectly, since I
grew up seeing everything as blurred:  seeing is *not* believing for me,
unlike most of the sighted.

Agreed.  But if we make it ```x, where x is some character, then we don't
have to introduce a new line type: it's just a convention about alt-text.

I did a little Google search for ["alt-text" -image -images] and there is
nothing except other senses of "alt text".  I also note that
in HTML5, the "alt" attribute is for the img, area, and input (graphical
button) elements only.  There is no notion of text with alt text.

I'm not _too_ pleased by how we're using one field for two different things (one is a description; the other is a thing for dumb parsers), but that's the spec we've got.

Previously, on this list, we discussed having the alt text be on the first ``` and parser hints be on the last ```, but I'm not sure anything came of that particular discussion other than some try-outs in a vacuum.

Ah.  Well, that certainly doesn't help blind people, nor does it help me (I
view text as black print on white paper, as God and Gutenberg intended!).
Still, I see why some people might want it.  Then again, I see why some
people (definitely including me!) would want italics.

Well, The Spec also says that alt-text in the closing preformat line MUST
be ignored by clients.

  The proposal above does not require a change in the specification for
text/gemini, and could be considered a convention used.

  I picked a format that should be easy to find, with a limited set of
options that, in my opinion, seem to cover the majority of cases with
preforamtted blocks.  Again with some examples, only with alt-text and NOT
with my proposal:

``` Python
Python! There in the grass,
ready to slide right up my ...
```

``` Python
 ____        _   _
|  _ \ _   _| |_| |__   ___  _ __
| |_) | | | |  _| '_ \ / _ \| ._ \
|  __/| |_| | |_| | | | (_) | | | |
|_|    \_,  |\__|_| |_|\___/|_| |_|
       |___/
```

``` Python
@app.route('/')
def index[]:
    try:
        session['num']
    except:
        session['success'] = False
        session['num'] = random.randrager(1,100)
    return render_template('index.html')
```

``` Python
Genus		#species	common name
-------------------------------------------
Antaresia	4		Children's phythons
Apodora		1		Papaun olive python
Aspidites	2		Sheild pythons
Bothrochilus	1		Bismark ringed python
Liasis		3		water pythons
```

  I think that '@poem', '@art', '@code' and '@data' would be very helpful to
a client program.  Adding an additional backtick for "something that isn't
readble" just seems too little.

  But anyone arguing for (or against) this, please feel free to use the
above Python examples when making arguments.

  Not enough in my opinion.

Thanks for your interest. Frames are the one thing I've seen that screen
readers most treat as a "container" that can be skipped. So, have the
blocks with a roll of frame, that is, the <iframe> roll if possible, or
just make them <iframe> if possible. I'm more of a user than a
developer, sorry. Other than that, GemiNaut, as far as I've used it,
works great. I'll stress test it more in the coming weeks and get back
to you if I find anything else.

Okay, these are a bit more chatty, speaking:


"full block full block full block full block full block full block em
quad full block full block em quad ..."


You get the idea. Yes, headings are useful, and I'm so glad Gemini
provides just enough structure to be helpful and useful, but not enough
to be annoying.

  A client could style each type differently, even if just a subtle change
in background color.  Or even different monospaced fonts depending upon
usage.

  It could even be "Row one widget one ninety-nine (pause) row two gadget
five ninety-nine (pause) row three fob one ninety-nine" but I can see the
repeated "row x" could get tiresome.

  How about alternating light and dark background for each row?  I mean, it
doesn't have to be a jarring contrast like black background/white
background, but black background/dark grey background, just to help visually
separate the records.

  No idea on this one, but a screen reader, in theory, could switch voices
for reading poetry.  

  I don't expect this to be standardized any time soon in the spec, as the
spec for text/gemini is line oriented and less with parsing the data in each
line.  But I can certainly see this as something clients slowly converge on,
much like gopher clients supporting selector types not specified in
RFC-1436.

  And the spec does say, "MAY be interpreted ... "

Asking people to write English words in their capsule is not
nice.  I'm against the use of words like this to define a
content, convention or not.

While this may sound ridiculous to people from the mailing list
because we have to speak English here, that doesn't mean Gemini
writers will understand English.  So far, gemtext only requires to
use some symbols. There are enough English everywhere, no need to
add some into gemtext.

Exactly. Headings and lists are two examples of structure that don't
annoy anyone and help with content organisation, instead of simply
providing aesthetics.

  Fair point.  How about:

	@sitelen
	@ilo
	@nanpa
	@lipu

  It's from a constructed language so there are (at least for now) no native
speakers of this language (hint:  it's not Esperanto, nor Klingon).

In my interpretation I make the assumption that the Gemini spec notes
where it deviates from the general shoulds and musts of the standard it
refers to and leaves everything else wihout comment. Otherwise, the
Gemini URI syntax is largely unspecified.

Also because, according o RFC 3986, "The syntax and semantics of URIs
vary from scheme to scheme, as described by the defining specification
for each scheme" with the Gemini spec not noting any variation from
the general case in 6.2.3.

I've raised this issue at least twice before, because there are some (or
one) Gemini server implementations that do not follow this, and will
serve a redirect on "gemini://host" to "gemini://host/", and the
expected content only on "gemini://host/". Even ignoring the
normalizations in RFC 3986, I don't know that there are any good reasons
to do this, but last I checked even gemini.circumlunar.space does.

So I think your assumption is fair, but also that the spec should be
updated to be explicit about this case because some server authors
obviously disagreed with us and we have to resort to RFC Sherlock
Holmes type inference to make a point otherwise.

There is another way, which is not 100%-foolprof (but, then, nothing
is), it's to show users that we care about extensions requests and do
not dismiss them automatically. If we clearly say why this extension
is a bad idea, it will be easier to exercice social pressure against
those who use it. If, on the other hand, we are closed to every
discussion, people will, as you notice, do it anyway, and badly.

It is also a matter of outreach: clearly documenting the "Gemini way"
and making it wildly accessible (the FAQ already does a good job).

According to what spec? "The path component contains data, usually
organized in hierarchical form" (RFC 3986). A URI with a trailing slash
may or may not represent a directory. It may or may not refer to the
same resource as the URI wihout the trailing slash. None of it is
specified. The idea of an URI path as analogous to a filesystem path can
be useful (RFC 3986 uses the file system analogy to describe
dot-segments), but is ultimately just an analogy.

In this case I think it's important to note the difference between a
personal opinion (yours being that there is a semantic difference
between URIs with and without trailing slashes) and specification (RFC
3986's being that there's a syntactic difference but no specified
semantic difference, and only a short note about the semantic meaning
of a path as containing "data, usually organized in hierarchical form").

Agreed. I've suggested pattern-based path rewrites and rules before,
like Apache or Nginx do. That time I think the question was about how to
best serve multilingual content.

May be not in "The Official Spec" but it certainly needs to be
somewhere, because otherwise people would tag the same information
differently ("last-modified", "last-change", "updated"), then
destroying its utility. The OpenStreetMap example (you can invent new
tags but you should use the official ones, when relevant) is certainly
pertinent.

Nobody imposes anything, Gemini has no armed forces.

Subject: Metadata Without A Proposal
Message-ID: <2Y52GN42TX9V3.3IPOSNAQ07KG3@nothien.uber.space>

Hi!

I've lost track of the currently raging metadata thread entirely, and so
I've started this as a new post.

Thus far, I think there's general consensus on the following needs for
any metadata proposal:

1. Must degrade gracefully for clients that don't understand metadata.

2. Must not be English-specific.
  
   Although the majority of gemtext/Gemini content is in English at the
   moment, we want more diversity.  "Forcing" (by convention) the usage
   of English upon non-English users is unwanted.
  
   This rules out some of the current proposals which are oriented around
   'tags', e.g. 'author' or 'license'.  Theoretically, you could have a
   list of tags for different languages, but that would grow into a
   horrifically long list, and is generally unsustainable.
  
3. Must be machine-parsable.
  
   Search engines, archivers, and other crawler-style clients need to be
   attended to.  Some of the information they need is: date, author, and
   license.
  
4. Should affect presentation.
  
   gemtext as a whole is about separating content from presentation.
   Some of the earlier metadata proposals referred to metadata for
   presentation, e.g. to specify a color to view the text in.  This is
   against the spirit of gemtext/Gemini (if not the spec).
  
5. Must be difficult to extend.
  
   Again, this comes from the general Gemini philosophy that anything
   that can be misused will be misused.  This rules out lots of current
   proposals because they specify tags, and the usage of tags can only be
   controlled by convention, which is subject to change.
  
6. Must be accessible.
  
   Some proposals discussed the usage of emojis, and others have opted
   for creating new unofficial line types.  These don't degrade
   gracefully for things like screen readers, until they adopt the
   metadata proposal.  That's not great.

I think that we don't need a "metadata proposal" to solve any of these
problems.  We already have everything we need in pre-existing formats
and specifications.  Only three metadata fields are really necessary:
date, author, and license.  New fields, if completely necessary, need to
be handled on a case-by-case basis.

## Dates

Dating content is mostly relevant to search engines, so that old (or
new) results can be filtered out.  My proposal with dates is to use what
we already have - the gmisub companion spec.  If any content (e.g. an
article) has an associated date, the index page should in gmisub format
list the content page with the date.  If content pages don't have any
associated date, simply don't list a date in the index.  Search engines
and crawlers can still choose to include date information based on when
they last crawled the page.

=> gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/companion/

One question this raises is what index page to use.  I think that the
engine should search through parent directories until it finds one which
fits the gmisub format and has the content page (they would need to do
this anyways in order to crawl the capsule containing the content page).
If the engine already knows about an index page which is on the same
capsule and that has the content page, it can use that.

## Licenses

We already have a great convention for licenses: giving it on the last
line of the document, with the line starting with `--`.  For example:

```An example of page with a license line
Hello world!

-- CC-BY-SA nothien
```

All we need to do with this convention is to formalize it as a companion
specification, maybe as `-- [SPDX license identifier] [owner]`.

## Authors

There are two possibilities I see with author metadata: either take it
from the license line, discussed above, or extend the gmisub spec to
also allow for an optional author field.

```A possible extension to the gmisub syntax with an author field
=> URL YYYY-MM-DD (Author) Title
```

We can tweak the format around a bit so that currently existing titles
which start with parenthesized text aren't misinterpreted.  In addition,
one shouldn't have to repeat the author field for every line; we can
have some system like only requiring the author field when it is
different from the immediately previous author.  I prefer the first
option, but I haven't explored when the license owner would differ from
the author (which I think is the case for e.g. news companies).

## Other Fields

Clearly, other fields aren't supported by this.  If you want to place
additional metadata in your content, then I suggest writing it in
natural language.  If it is absolutely necessary to have it
machine-parsable (so that it can be specially understood by e.g. search
engines) then we can talk about that here on the ML, but others have
argued against e.g. tags because they allow easily manipulating search
results.  Expect resistance.

## Metadata for Storage

Author and license metadata is stored within the page itself, and so
that's not a problem.  Personally, I store date information in the file
name of the document (e.g. 2021-02-26-proposal.gmi), but I understand
that this doesn't work for everyone: in that case, see below.

There are legitimate uses for additional metadata when storing gemtext,
such as for capsule-local tagging.  These fields should be stored using
any arbitrary convention in the content: after all, these fields are not
meant to be parsed by external client software (i.e. search engines and
crawlers), but are only parsed by capsule-local software (such as to
organize content by tag).

## Conclusion

I don't think we need a 'metadata proposal' to achieve the goals we're
looking for.  The format conventions are already mostly in place; we
just need to formalize them.

FWIW, I personally agree with the trust of your position.

Even though I personally prefer using the existing capabilities of the link construct, which is the only structured artifact in text/gemini, e.g.:

LICENSE

Furthermore, all the RELs & schemas are already defined:

Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes
https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml

Link Relations
https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xml

There is literally nothing for Gemini to invent. 

Just use what already exists.

Thank you, I did not know of this convention, it seems fitting for the license.

SPDX id are also a good fit, it?s a standard we can rely on.

Is there a gemini mirror of common licenses text?
Intuitively I would?ve put the license as a link to the legal text.

The parser could have aliases for duplicate keys, but I agree is best if we have as few aliases as possible. I am of the opinion that the keys should be in the language of the document.

One of the things missing in the current specification is a formal
grammar of gemtext, so there is currently no way to know if lines must
end with a end-of-line or is the end-of-file sufficient.

=> gemini://gemini.bortzmeyer.org/gemini/missing-eol.gmi Example

Amfora and Lagrange seem to accept the last line (the one without an
end-of-line). But your example with cat would break it, concatening
the last line of the first file with the first line of the second file.

Because humans (specially non-anglosaxon humans) have trouble with
"From", "Subject" and "Message-ID"?

I'm not convinced by this "look at the SEO mess" argument. Gemini is
not the Web, there is no money at stake, marketing people and salesmen
frown upon Gemini ("what, no pictures? No tracking?") so I really
doubt that many people would resort to dirty tricks just to be higher
in GUS' results.

I'd say it is diminishing its utility, and even then mostly for third parties (like indexers).
I also believe that useful metadata will roughly converge to a format within a
natural language, like we're already seeing with meta-data like "Tags:". Sure, there are variations,
but it's not unreasonable to say these are the responsibility of the third party to pick up on. 

And if some writer really wants to be indexed by a particular engine, that engine
should put up a list of useful metadata for writers to use. Different engines can
copy each other, or be more distinctive in their meta-data requests.

Now e.g. chinese writers can freely use "??:" for tags, meaning they probably don't 
care about being indexed/archived by non-chinese engines, but if an all-languages
engine still want to index the page, they can if they put in the work.[0]

So,

What are the benefits of a consolidated meta-data format for the two most important parties
within Gemini: the writer and the reader?

Why are the third parties (indexers, archivers, etc) for whom meta-data could be
important not working on this by themselves? They can write and publish rules, and
then try to get the writers onboard. And writers can decide for themselves if the
extra trouble is worth the extra discoverability/better archiving, etc, forcing third 
parties to co-operate and to keep it simple.

In short, I don't understand the need for regulation when non-regulated convergence
seems a natural outcome that will fit the various use cases better through an evolutioanry
process. Granted,  waiting for convergence is a lot slower, but does faster adoption  
really matter with Gemini?

Agreed.

What is the preferable alternative? We could use numbers to indicate
element type, but ultimately numbers are dependent on numeral systems,
which depend on language and culture.

If instead of using English directly, we define opaque strings of
characters for the tags, such that the tag "author" consistently means
"author", we really achieve the same thing. That is a simple solution
that is language independent.

Or we could use emoji, although I believe most computer users in the
world would have a harder time typing out a given emoji than a given
opaque, ASCII- and English-compatible string.

> 3. Must be machine-parsable.

We should consider the difference between needs and wants here. If I
have no interest in specifying another license to use my work than what
is implied from my sharing it, that doesn't necessarily mean I don't
want to specify date or author, so perhaps all or most elements should
be optional.

Agreed, but as I understand it you do *not* want it to affect
presentation.

What do you propose that prevents conventional use from dictating
reality? And why is it important that the specification can not be
extended? Unlike e.g. text/gemini, if a client doesn't support some
superset of the tags initially specified, there is no degradation. If
in the future we want to extend a meta data format to support e.g.
specifying where, in addition to when, it was written, the clients that
don't support it shouldn't suffer from it.

The only important concern to me is that there is a canonical
description of tags. That description can be extended indefinitely as
far as I'm concerned, for as long as the original meanings of the
initial set of supported tags aren't changed or overloaded by newer
tags.

Agreed.

I think that instead of defining ourselves what fields are important we
should start from a standard, e.g. DCMI with the element set defined in
IETF RFC 5013.

With that as a basis, if there is no suitable format already, we can
define a human readable, text-compatible data format and a corresponding
text/xyz MIME type. Then, a text/gemini document that feels like
supplying additional metadata can link to a metadata file which the
server serves with the above MIME type. A client that does not support
the MIME type should defer to serving unknown text/* types as plain
text. A client that does support it can localize the elements, including
things like names and date and time formats. If the client is a
crawler, it should find the linked metadata document as a matter of its
normal operation because it is linked from the document.

Such formats already exist, but there is little interest in authoring
such files.

In that way, no extension or change to Gemini is necessary. No
specialized sub-formats for existing line types either.

Personally I don't think this is a standard I would use either way.
It's mostly for the benefit of robots that there's a point in
formalizing information like this. Humans can interpret such
information as indicated in the document itself in a much wider variety
of formats. It's not my intention, primarily, to serve robots.

Very good point. No one actually cares :)

I personally do use metadata in gemini for my own purpose, in my own little bubble ? but quite frankly couldn't care less about any of the current crop of wacky proposals :D

So you wouldn't mind using ?????? instead of "author" if we agree
it can be opaque to the users?

... Did you read the rest of the e-mail?  I listed specific ways in
which we can support date, author, and license metadata, using existing
formats and conventions, none of which use English (for licenses,
instead of SPDX license identifiers, Petite Abeille has neatly suggested
using links, although I don't agree with their format).

So you want to force non-English Gemini writers to use English words?
When (seeing my original proposal) it's unnecessary?  Imagine if you had
to end every Gemini document with the magic incantanation "?????????G?".
That doesn't seem fun.

The sole purpose of giving a fixed format to metadata is so that it is
machine parsable; all other metadata can simply be stated using natural
language.  And yes, if you read the rest of my e-mail, you would notice
that everything in it is completely optional.

Non-extensibility is a fundamental part of the spirit of Gemini.  We
want to prevent metadata from being used for all but the specified
purposes so that it is not misused in the future.  Consider, for
example, a 'color' metadata key that had been suggested early on in the
original metadata thread.  We want to prevent these kinds of misuses
from happening at all.  Notice that my proposal-not-proposal handles
each metadata field on a case-by-case basis; there is no way provided to
handle additional fields.  In addition, I've stated that other metadata
fields, which don't have to be known to search engines, can use an
arbitrary, capsule-specific convention, so that you can use additional
metadata fields internally.

This has a few problems:

1. It is extensible.  As I've argued above, we don't want extensibility.
   This would mean that we have to have a very strict format for this
   metadata file, and given how few fields are really necessary to be
   machine-parsable, this would be a very small file.  With my proposal,
   we can embed all the necessary metadata into the existing files.

2. The keys specified in IETF RFC 5013 are English-specific.  As I've
   explained in my original mail, this is not sustainable for
   non-English Gemini clients and writers, as either the writers are
   forced to use English (bad), or the clients are forced to support the
   same keywords across a /lot/ of languages (bad).

Many gemlogs use the gmisub format, which is essentially providing date
metadata.  There are uses, and making your content understandable to
'robots' will also make it understandable to the users behind them.  One
particularly helpful area that my proposal-not-proposal provides for is
basic search engine filtering (by date, author, and license).

Wow. Brutal :P

One thing is crystal clear: we do not share any common ground whatsoever on what "metadata" means :D

You should go talk to the RDF people ?. They would love your collective input :)

It's not completely true.  This example was specifically for UNIX-like
systems where files are expected to end with a newline.  It's POSIX
fault, as it defines a line as a sequence of character ending with a \n:

I can agree, but I find preferable something like

	# Hypothetical archive page for a Gemini mailing list in Italian

	Da: Omar Polo <op at omarpolo.com>
	A: <someone at example.com>
	CC: ...
	Oggetto: [spec] proposta per i metadatai

	```
	actual raw body of the e-mail...
	```

instead of

	-: x-mail-from="Omar Polo <op at omarpolo.com>"
	-: x-mail-to=<someone at example.com>
	-: x-mail-subject="..."
	```
	...
	```

or even

	```
	actual body of the email
	```

	^^^
	from: ...
	to: ...
	...

"Free-form metadata", as in simple text paragraphs made up like that,
are probably already widespread, intuitive for writers and readers, and
probably also "simple enough" for tools to grok, at least partially.  It
also solves localisation problems, because it's the author that is free
to pick the way he/she prefers to conveys the meaning for his/her
audience.  Different authors may choose different keys for the same
"idea" (i.e. "Updated", "last-updated", "edited" ...), that's true, this
solution is not without its drawbacks.

(ah, all of this without adding dangerous ways to extend the text format)

I acknowledge that this is not a problem right now, and hopefully will
never be, but we should be aware of the troubles.  Adding a syntax for
metadata will (possibly) open the doors for tracking, styling, etc.

What is the need for formalizing this? The alt text as currently
specified can easily be used to describe the content of the section in
plain words that read as-is by a screen reader would give the
non-sighted user an indication of what comes next and whether they
might want to skip it.

I can see from the follow-up discussion that you don't primarily intend
for these tags to aid in accessibility, but to allow minor adjustments
to visual presentation. I think that instead of shoehorning this
suggestion for a spec change into a discussion about accessibility in
clients you should post it with a new subject so as to avoid taking an
important discussion in an entirely unrelated direction.

I think you recognize the difference between "it would be cool if the
spec was changed so that a client could display a code block in a
different color shade than a poem" and "it would be cool if [Clients]
allowed non-sighted users to browse Gemini effectively".

The primary issue with this is that you're relying on English words
('LICENSE', 'AUTHOR', 'DATE'), which isn't sustainable or accessible.
The same holds for the rel= type tagging.  In addition, it is
extensible, which (as I've detailed) is not necessary and is against the
spirit of Gemini.

Typing out these links is also going to be time-consuming, which is
irritating when you're in the middle of writing a post.  It's like we're
adding boilerplate text; we want to make it as small and unnoticeable as
possible, which is contradictory to using links.

Finally, (and this is a personal opinion), I don't like
non-network-related schemes (except for mailto).  I also think that a
lot of the information is repetitive.

However, I think that using a URL for licenses isn't a bad idea, because
it removes dependency upon SPDX license identifiers, which are
English-oriented.  At the same time, I don't know of any licenses which
are written in other languages (please correct me if I'm wrong), which
means that anybody licensing their work is using a license written in
English, and so they may as well use the SPDX license identifier.

What is the need to formalize /any/ of Gemini?! What's the point of any of the current discussions? TGIF entertainment?

No progress has been made whatsoever in even attempting to formally specify the most basic aspect of Gemini. Nothing. Nada. Zero.

And Solderpunk is MIA for months.

And the kids are running amok.

Nicely done Gemini.

Thank you for reaching out.

But really... it's all good. We have no common ground to share in this conversation ? that much is clear.

No drama though. This is all a hobby. No one cares :)

In the memorable words of President Dale, of Mars Attacks! fame:

"Why can't we work out our differences? Why can't we work things out? Little people, why can't we all just get along?"

Sometime, there is nothing whatsoever to work out at all. 

Mutual indifference is best :)

And these implementations are right, since the point is currently not
specified (one of the holes in the specification).

A possible way to address a lot of such holes (though not all of them)
would be to just state in the specification:

"For path, query and fragments semantics, just do like the http
scheme." This would solve this problem and would be reasonable since
many people assume that all schemes behave like http.

"gemini is (almost) perfect the way it is now" I am personally not at
ease with people who claim thay they (or their party, or their
religion, or their specification) is perfect. I understand that
<gemini://when.willgemini.support/> is supposed to be a joke but I
think it is a bad one.

That's pretty fair. I'd add that metadata is not really all it's cracked
up to be, in an open system like Gemini (or the web). It works fine
within a site or an organization, but it almost never works to depend on
"other people's" metadata for anything.

It no longer works, for me, returning "42 An unexpected error

well-known is unknown to gemini.

At time, I wonder what "radical familiarity" actually means in the context of gemini crocket ? as gemini doesn't exhibit any traits which could reasonably be qualified as "radical", nor "familiar".

This will stay a mystery forever.

The point of this discussion was to figure out how clients can make
pre-formatted sections more accessible to blind users. Under the
subject "[Clients] Gemini and accessibility regarding preformatted code
blocks" I think we should stick to that topic. As such, I've changed
the subject line to reflect the topic of this branch. That way people
can easily see that this discussion is completely irrelevant to the
original topic, and they can more promptly ignore it to make productive
use of their time.

Well, TLS doesn't block traffic analysis (who's talking to whom at what
time).  For that you need Tor (a U.S. government-funded effort, by the way).

That's the idea.  There is a language problem, of course, if the server
explains it in a language you don't know.  Again, this isn't something I
want seriously considered.

No, just carelessness/laziness on my part.  The text I want to comment on
often starts in the middle of a line, so I delete everything I *don't* want

Regarding changes to voices based on content type, screen readers don?t switch voices for poetry or anything, unless something like SSML is used. Even then, the screen reader must support sending the SSML directly to the speech synthesizer, and the speech synthesizer must support SSML. Otherwise, everything is plain text, with no variation on speech or anything besides normal clause pauses and such.

I also saw somewhere in this thread someone suggest something that would
enable the server to dictate the delivery of how the content is
presented. I'm definitely NOT in favor of something that requires
clients to format text a certain way based on what a server says, and
further, such is contrary to the design philosophies of Gemini going
back as far as discussions in June 2019 before the first line of code
was ever written by anyone.

Indeed. And this is an elegant solution.

It is, however, from the perspective of a developer, and as I certainly
admire its utility and I have no real issues with something like this,
I'm also thinking about the majority of people writing gemlogs. It is
asking a bit (of optional syntax) that expects an author of a page as
well as the author of a client to incorporate.

Where this may be an ideal situation, my original intent wasn't to
suggest any particular handlers, but rather, a simple convention that
*some* authors of clients could key off of in the text, who are wanting
to facilitate "Accessibility" for non-sighted readers.

Perhaps there are more comprehensive aspects that are beyond what I was
attempting to address for avoiding the spamnation of non-sighted
readers... So I don't really have a real preference, other than to say
whatever it is, that it be simple for someone writing a page and easy
for authors of *some* clients to accommodate.

I think this was a suggestion to alter the spec. As such I feel it's not
necessary to consider as such. What I suggested, indeed implemented, was
a way for a client to interpret something that follows as something that
a non-sighted reader would rather not have to endure.

I believe it was Solene that brought up the obvious, that '```' and
'````' are prone to issues. When I read what she wrote, I thought about
using a colon (:) instead, very unobtrusive for a key that could alert
*some* clients to not deliver what is contained in the block, while
keeping the readability of the raw .gmi file.

Where actual code is concerned, I think that what Sean proposed is
probably the most effective, and still by convention, not any spec
changes, but it "might" add a lot of weight to *some* clients that seek
to provide syntax highlighting.

Where poetry is concerned, I fail to see the significance at all. It's a
block of preformatted text, right? Am I missing something? Coz I fail to
see the significance between prose and poetry where preformatted text is
concerned. It certainly has no significance where accessibility is
concerned, IMO, since non-sighted readers would probably want to listen
to the poems anyway, albeit, with a really messed up cadence ;)

Just imagine yourself, surfing Gemini space, and having to listen to this:

The following is beyond the scope of my immediate concern for agreed
upon convention by the authors of clients to enable user accessibility
for non-sighted readers. I think that here is where what Sean has
proposed comes into its own and demonstrates some real value, and, as he
points out changes nothing in the spec - but it does ask a bit of the
authors of Gemini clients who wish to enrich the presentation of syntax.

This next example from Sean I want to address in more detail, so I'll do

Okay Solene and I discussed something related to the above off list
briefly, and it is really on a different topic altogether, but I might
as well bring it up here because I keep seeing people asking for changes
to the spec to accommodate more markdown features, which is IMO,
problematic.

I mentioned to Solene that I thought it would be nice if more features
of Markdown were supported in clients, but that doesn't mean that it has
any business being in the Gemini specification.

Why? Because Markdown for the most part is perfectly readable even if it
isn't rendered as such (Even pretty much tables with cells, etc.).

So my use case is writing papers like showcased above with Genus and
Species like, **Flabellina iodinea** or **Cordyceps sinensis** or
**Pleurotus ostreatus** - Scientific convention is such that one should
italicize or underline genus and species. Now, markdown makes that  nice
and easy, but most everyone already knows how to interpet "*" or "**" or
"***" or their underbar equivalents and it does nothing to detract from
the readability of the text even if it isn't rendered as bold, or
underlined, or in italics.

The one thing that I would like  to see support for in clients, is the
inline preformatted text begin and end markers:
i.e., `$ rm -f /bin/laden`. But absolutely NONE of these things require
nor beg for inclusion into the Gemini spec, yet they *could* be
supported in *some* clients.

I hope that puts those discussions for the expanded use of markdown to
be included in the spec, at least for the next fortnight :)

Yes, thank you for making those exammples handy :)

Indeed.

Solene also mentioned her aprehensions in using a particular language
for such tags, which I thought was very eloquently addressed by
Stephanie below:

<snip>
OK, inspired by my past life as a Perl programmer, I suggest a fully
i18n solution:

```@    (ASCII art)
```$    (Code)
```%    (poetry)
```|    (data)

</snip>

I really like this too! Notwithstanding my questions as to why poetry
would be relevant, and the only thing I would mention would be that I
don't actually care for the "@" sign, for to me, it usually implies
other meanings, although I get the association it may have for ASCII. I
would prefer rather, something like the colon (:), as it's rather
innocuous where implications are concerned, doesn't stand out like a
ketchup stain on a white shirt when someone is reading a raw .gmi  file,
and it will work with ASCII art, ANSI art, or anything else that may
subject the listener to cacophany.

But whatever anyone comes up with between these two types of proposals
I'll be happy to implement when I author my .gmi files.

I feel a sense of urgency, however, for at the very least, addressing
the matter of user accessibility now, in consideration of those who
would listen to the audible delivery of text/gemini.

And for that, I feel that we will actually be best served by those who
actually author Gemini clients, as to their suggestions on how they feel
best in implementing that type of support in their products.

All very valid concerns and suggestions. Just let me know soon how to

Of all the proposed solutions, this one seems the most obvious.

The main problem with it is the spec, as it reads:
"Alt text may also be used for computer source code to identify the programming language which advanced clients may use for syntax highlighting."

which is what a lot of the alternative solutions are trying to accomodate for.

Using the alt-text for source code highlighting sounds like a fun idea, but does it 
really belong in the spec? It feels like a remnant of a cool idea that a programmer
*would* put in a spec in its early stages, since it feels like a natural fit, but maybe,
in retrospect, it doesn't really belong there.

I think it would be best to drop that line from the spec--which would mean changing it,
but at least it's not extending it--and adopt your proposed solution as a simple convention
for those who want to make their content easily available for the visually impaired.

Apologies, I need to address one mistake in my last post and add one
thought.

First, the mistake. I forgot to remove the quote marks for Seans
example, in case anyone got confused and would attribute the change to him.


```:

  ____        _   _
 |  _ \ _   _| |_| |__   ___  _ __
 | |_) | | | |  _| '_ \ / _ \| ._ \
 |  __/| |_| | |_| | | | (_) | | | |
 |_|    \_,  |\__|_| |_|\___/|_| |_|
        |___/
```

I'm not suggesting that the above actually be what the authors of
clients should choose to adopt as their "convention", I'm just
clarifying that I edited Sean's example for the purposes of using it as
an example, as he  suggested :)

Second, I would prefer not to refer to ASCII art or ANSI art as art at
all for the purposes of user accessibility, but rather, something like
perhaps "Noise". Because that is effectively what we're doing by
treating such preformatted blocks as a comment, filtering out the noise
for those who will be listening audibly to the dictation of a .gmi file.

Besides, .png and .jpg files, and even .gif or video files may
themselves either contain or themselves be artwork.

Beyond any of that, I do think we need to move on the issue of noise
with some expedience.

I hope that helps :)

Indeed. "Search" does not work, but "Query backlinks" works.

Hi,

i didn't realize that Stephane wrote to the mailing list and 
answered him directly to his personal mail. So here we go again. ;)


It will work again - once the currently running indexing is done.
Unfortunately this is a shortcoming of the current GUS implementation.

Crawling and updating the search index are separate steps and the later one
locks the search index database.
Unfortunately, as geminispace grows, this becomes more of a pain than earlier 
cause indexing takes more time.

It seems that a mirror of a webpage with a huge archive popped up a few
days ago. I had to stop the crawl as it was still fetching this archive, i
probably need to exclude this mirror until we were able to improve the
performance of crawling/indexing.
Unfortunately i'm not that familiar with Python, so it may take some time.

Especially the data gathering parts (crawling/indexing) are currently bottlenecks. 
They are strictly sequential and single-threaded "one page at a time"
which will prolong these processes increasingly. 
But there are some more issues which arise as geminispace keeps growing,
GUS was not designed to index large capsulses which mirrors of webpages.

If you are interested in helping out with Python coding feel free to join,
every help is welcome:
https://src.clttr.info/rwa/geminispace.info/issues

I'm not sure if its feasible to improve GUS in a sustainable way or if we need
to start over and come up with a new design that honors the growth of geminispace 
(and is likely much more complex than GUS currently is).

regards
Ren?

Just a quick note to browser devs, you don't have to put the double right
arrow symbol next to links, and indeed, if I arrow unto a link line, I
expect Enter to activate that link. But, with the double right arrow symbol
before that link on the line, it just activates that instead, with no
result. I've taken out the double right arrow of the Elpher client, since
that's configurable, but it isn't in GemiNaut so I can only Tab to the link
then press Enter, or use the screen reader's "next link" command. Oh and a
keyboard command to go to the address bar is always great. :)

Every form of somewhat organised info is "machine readable", only
sentences and stuff aren't.

We use a text-based format, so this is semi-bogus.
I can easily add stuff, such as styling, to my documents *without* a
tag format and make software to support it - without extending the
spec.
Gemini wants to be "non-extensible", but having freeform text breaks that.
This is an unfixable problem though, and just a side effect of what Gemini is.

This would only really work for things that are looking at sites as a
whole, mainly search engines.
My issue with these metadata in separate location ideas is that it
creates additional work, and network requests, to get the info about
one file.
Also for more one-off things with dates, creating gmisub stuff for it
is slightly overboard.

See above about gmisub.
The licence line makes most sense to me, however not everyone adds
licenses (meaning they get copyright), and may still want their name
on it, the current method of licence-first doesn't work in this case.

(`- name` is how I sign my emails and stuff when I remember)
There's probably many other ways this could be done, the above was
just a quickly typed example.

In the example I have pointed out a second issue - licenses that aren't in SPDX.
I'm not entirely sure what SPDX is, but from a quick search it appears
it doesn't contain the DBAD license (which is what I personally use
for stuff I really don't care about).

Agreed on this, tag metadata formats are just a catch-all, and
catch-alls are typically bad.

I agree that the catch-all metadata proposals are unneeded, I think we
should stop with them.
I would also think we should start calling them catch-all metadata or
something similar, there's a distinction between a generic format that
allows any metadata, and dedicated formats for individual pieces of
metadata, such as dates, authors and licenses.

My point is that thus far, we've kept Gemini software from trying to
read any natural language.  I want to keep it that way.

I disagree, because although you _can_ use additional syntaxes and write
software to support it, Gemini is already too big to spread to make it
a shared consensus from any one person's content alone.  However, I want
to stay on the safe side (in particular, with the 'individual actor'
assumption), and so I'm trying to prevent adding new areas of
extensibility.

You're right, this only works for crawlers.  What other use cases can
you think of where the software has to know the date of external
content?

If there are actual use cases, then we can probably tweak the license
line format, using full dates instead of just the year.  For example:

```Example license line using a ISO 8601 date
-- ? 2021-02-26 nothien
```

The format can be tweaked, sure.  But I think it's more important first
to agree that this is the way to go before trying to choose a specific
syntax.

Oh no.  I don't want non-SPDX licenses to be second-class citizens.  The
most 'correct' way to deal with this in Gemini, IMO, is to use a URL (so
a link line) to the license, but I'm worried about the extra typing
needed, which would put authors off typing out license lines.
Boilerplate is a powerful tool for generating irritation.  However,
short links in most cases (e.g. 'gemini://spdx.dev/GPL-3.0-or-later',
although this doesn't work) should help ease that issue, while allowing
for other licenses to be used.  Of course, this would require reworking
the syntax, but as I said above, that's fine.  Thoughts?

I was kind of expecting to see a solution based on an existing search engine to emerge, such as elastic search, by implementing only the gemini specific parts, but I looked into quite a few project and all were terribly complicated?

A search engine service has three parts: the crawler, the indexer and
the querier (the one the user interacts with). ElasticSearch could be
a good idea for the last two (at least the second and may be part of
the third). You still have to write the crawler and, speaking for
experience, this is not a one week-end project. At the beginning, it
is, you have a prototype running quite rapidly but then, in the real
world, a lot of problems happen. My "favorite" is capsules accepting
TCP, completing the TLS handshake, but then not replying to queries
but there are also endless redirections and other "funny" stuff. A
crawler has to be paranoid! Managing such a beast takes time, and the
growth of the geminispace (47 capsules added yesterday, a new record,
including one in catalan, apparently the first one) requires than you
plan in advance: what works today won't in a few months.

I can't believe GUS has been around for over a year at this point.
There was one fairly substantial refactor about 4-5 months in, but the
architecture is still *mostly* the same as it was on day one. I think
that's kind of cool, because that means GUS has mostly survived a bit
over an order of magnitude of Geminispace growth - the first GUS crawl
indexed 26 domains! I'm not sure if you were looking for the story of
GUS, or an explanation of "why not Elasticsearch," but I'll tell the
story anyway in case it's interesting to anyone :)

GUS has two parts (similar to how Stephane broke down the problem in
another response): there's the crawler and there's the searcher. In
the beginning, the crawler wrote directly to a TF-IDF index as it
crawled. Then, the searcher, when run later, was simply a reader and
searcher of that same index.

It's interesting to note that, although I chose to build slightly
closer to the metal than, say, Elasticsearch, it's still basically the
same tech. Elasticsearch wraps niceties around Lucene, which is a
library for doing TF-IDF development. I chose to use a different
TF-IDF library directly in GUS - I thought for fun, I would try one
that was native to Python, to keep the project as self-contained as
possible. I found Whoosh [1], and while it's had a few sharp edges,
it's mostly been great to work with.

[1] https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/

Onto the big refactor I mentioned happened 4-5 months in. TF-IDF
indexes I would best describe as "fragile." You have to be careful
about interrupting any writes, you don't get easy transactions or
rollbacks like you do with most relational databases. This became
increasingly frustrating to have to deal with as part of the crawl,
which (again, as Stephane) is a difficult beast to manage in the real
world. Capsules get creative :) So I added one extra piece to GUS'
architecture - a SQLite database. The crawl writes to the SQLite
database, then the TF-IDF index is built afterwards, from what's in
the database.

I think GUS is about due for another rearchitecture of the crawler. A
lot of the recent hacking on GUS is being done by a few folks like
Rene with geminispace.info, so I would also be curious what their
ideas are, but I think there could be a lot of promise taking a
similar approach to what mozz did for his Gemini archiver [2].

[2] https://github.com/michael-lazar/mozz-archiver/

I also think the WARC output format is cool. It makes me think of a
world in which maybe we could even get rid of the need for crawling -
just provide tooling that folks can use to package their own capsule
into a WARC, then they submit it. It would be a more efficient use of
network bandwidth than crawling is, and it would also naturally be
opt-in, which after lots of reflection, I think would be a nice
property for a place like Gemini.

Well that's the story of GUS. Let me know if you have any questions or
want me to expound on any of this. I will close by saying I am very
excited and thankful to see new folks like Rene and Remco get so
involved with this project, and I am really looking forward to the
future of search in Gemini.

Warm regards,
Natalie

It would be about 1 MB per 10,000 files and it would be updated
selectively by the script.  I think that's generally good enough.

Inline signatures would work well in some cases.  They are ugly, but
they're otherwise the perfect solution: no extra network requests, clear
indication of which file is signed...

You mean keyservers?  They weren't doing so well, last I checked:
https://gist.github.com/rjhansen/67ab921ffb4084c865b3618d6955275f

But it looks like keys.openpgp.org has remedied those issues:
https://keys.openpgp.org/about/news#2019-06-12-launch

Still, it's only a single source.  Are there any other such modern
keyservers?

We would lose the PGP version of it, although there's nothing stopping
you from signing someone else's signify key, to show that you trust it
(and send that person your signature, to publish on his/her site).  This
gives us an ad-hoc web of trust.

I never had the chance to use the PGP web of trust.  It sounds good in
theory, but in practice the UI seriously hinders its adoption.  It might
work within projects like Debian, but if I want to verify a file on the
net made by someone I don't know (and whose PGP-friends I don't know),
the only way for me to check if I have the right key is to get it from
multiple sources and/or network perspectives.  This is what I've always
done, the web of trust never entered the picture.

Ah, ok.  In this case, I would explain in a separate page: "this is the
author's text and this is his signature" (links to both).  Again, an
ad-hoc solution for a rare use case, no technical burden.  This would be
my preference, at least.

Indeed. I remember many years ago writing a crawler for the web and
finding similar challenges, despite initially getting excited with a
barebones prototype with just a few lines of code. It's not easy to
handle all the exceptions to the regular behaviour.

I'm not sure if it is fully mirrored, I see you use Kineto which is pretty good to do just that.  There is also kiln which I use to manage my gemini / web versions https://git.sr.ht/~adnano/kiln

I don't know which software https://gemini.circumlunar.space is using (I 
think the HTML pages are manually created) but I know a popular option 
is Kineto: https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/kineto/

Citing sources would be exactly the same, just a different protocol in the URL.

e.g.:
```
Would become
{{cite web
 |title=Project Gemini FAQ
 |url=gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/faq.gmi
 |access-date=27 Feb 2021
 |url-status=live
 |archiveurl=
 |archivedate=
 |df=dmy-all
}}</ref>
```

The archive links don't *have* to be from archive.org, that's just
what's typically used.
AFAIK we don't have any archives like that yet, so for now that would
have to be left missing (which is perfectly fine - it's an optional
field).
The only Gemini Space archives I know of are data dumps.

Having a dedicated template for gemini space probably would be best though :)
{{Template:cite gemini space}} or something


> According to Wikipedia citations for pages typically include:
>
> * URL of the specific page

>   (required if the publication date is unknown)

AFAIK this is mostly added by hand, except the URL and maybe title.
Syntax for this stuff is still not decided on so I'd wait until then
to add it anyways.

I wish I did, it's a lot more robust than my script, but I'll share what
I use to convert gemini://nytpu.com to https://www.nytpu.com/gemini.

I use this awk script to convert a gemtext document to html:
https://www.nytpu.com/files/gem2html.awk

and this bash script on a cron job to automate the whole site (there's
lots of symlinking images and non-gemtext files):

I've just got an Idea for clients which can't easily implement sections 
in their document rendering [1].
The preformatted block could be reduced to a special "link" with the 
alt-text as label (or a placeholder) that, when activated shows a dialog 
window containing the content of the preformatted block. One could then 
instruct the screenreader to read the content of that window, if it 
starts talking gibberish one can simply close that window.

I don't know how well screenreaders would handle this, so feedback will 
be appreciated.

Greetings!

Yes, this would work well. I'll give Dragonstone a go.

Okay, a note on Dragonstone: the text is readable, but seems to be plain
text, so tabbing to what I assume should be links on the "test" page
didn't work. Although, I guess that's all I'd really need to know about
are the links, but if the output could be "webified" by an engine that
Orca knows about, like geko or something to GTK, that'd be all the
better. The only other issue I found while doing a quick run is that the
"settings" button is unlabeled.

Apologies for not making it clear that Dragonstone is in it's current 
state a horrible mess that only really works when you are a well sighted 
mouse or touchscreen user (That doesn't even include myself a lot of the 
time), which is the reason I'm giving it a rewrite (because one year 
younger me made terrible design decisions)

The settings button unfortunately has never been more than a placeholder 
and is always insensitive (it's a kind of reminder for myself, gui 
settings will come, promised)

On the popup window: I'll definitely make that one an option in the new 
version.

On the links: Can you give Castor a try and tell us how the buttons for 
links approach works? (I REALLY want to avoid having to include half a 
webbrowser)
(I had that one in the older versions of dragonstone, but I realized 
that inserting widgets into text buffers isn't exactly performance 
friendly. If that works I'll make it an option in the current version, 
although I'd have to limit it to a about a thousand links per page (I 
have to add a configuration option anyway, so this will be configurable) 
to avoid sites being able to freeze the ui)

I'll announce the rewrite when it is in a presentable state, but please 
don't expect anything before September. (School is keeping me busy)
Thanks you for trying it out anyways and giving feedback! ?

Subject: [announce] Website and FAQ changes
Message-ID: <C9L3VK8JFVJ8.1Z6QGCIG7UEZ5@stilgar>

Greetings Geminauts!

Last weekend I made a change to the https://gemini.circumlunar.space
website setup.  Rather than being comprised of static HTML files
generated (somewhat inaccurately/unreliably) from the text/gemini
originals, the site now uses Drew DeVault's "Kineto" proxy to serve a
live and direct mirror of the Gemini version of the site.  The new
ability of the website to accurately render text/gemini syntax features
which aren't also park of Markdown (which is how the original
translation was done) allowed me to finally make use of actual Gemini
links in the FAQ and other documents, so I did a bit of an overhaul of
the FAQ, arguably long overdue.

(yes, this change may have slightly reduced readability of the Gopher
version of the site, and I do plan to improve that in future)

I wanted to draw attention to three things in particular:

Firstly, I have removed, for now, the offer of free hosting at
gemini.circumlunar.space from the FAQ.  This is mostly to spare me the
time of dealing with account requests, but also to stimulate the
creation of more hosting services and the development of a decentralised
Geminispace.  I may reinstate hosting in future if I find the time to
come up with a more automated signup process.  I will still create
accounts for people who sent requests before I made this change - sorry
for the delay!

Secondly, the FAQ now includes detailed instructions on how to submit
patches for translations of the documentation into languages other than
English.  Dutch, German and Porgutuese translations have already been
merged into the repo, which I am very happy about and grateful for.
With the workflow for translations now established and publicised, I
would like to repeat my call for people to volunteer translation efforts
into additional languages.

Finally, as of quite recently, Kineto now has support for custom CSS to
control the appearance of HTTP mirrors of Gemini sites.  It should come
as no surprise to anybody that I don't have strong skills in this
department, nor do I consider the design of the website to be of
tremendous importance.  But there was discussion on the list in the past
about the accessibility issues of the then-current website, and I do
take that concern seriously.  I'm happy for the site to look pleasant,
but my number one priority is that it is easy to read for the widest
possible variety of users and on the widest possible variety of devices,
screen sizes, etc.

I don't think this is worth the time and energy of a big formal
design competition/selection process with rules and voting, etc.  But if
people want to send me proposed new stylesheets sometime in the next,
say, two weeks, I will consider them for adoption and will make a
unilateral decision at some point based first and foremost on how the
design is rated by various automated accessibility scoring tools and by
how it performs on the widest variety of devices I can manage to test it
on.  Just save https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/faq.gmi to a static
file, edit the in-line CSS and send me the result.  Please don't submit
any designs which pull in external resources, and please do not use
browser-specific CSS hacks.  All else being equal I will strongly prefer
shorter and simpler stylesheets using only basic CSS properties.

Subject: [announce] Delegation of responsibility for spec finalisation
Message-ID: <C9L5D1RBASBR.1TJ2NAT0EIQPY@stilgar>

Howdy Geminauts,

The first quarter of 2021 is passing by rapidly, with less progress on
finalising the few outstanding spec questions before the process of
translating the specification to a more precise and formal format
suitable for standardisation than I had hoped for.

It has become clear to me that for a variety of reasons I am no longer
able to effectively lead this process myself.  Therefore, effective as
of the sending of this email, I am delegating decision-making authority
for finalising the spec to Sean Conner <sean at conman.org>.

There is no change in my long-standing overall stance that Gemini
requires no new features and that remaining work on the specification
should be directed only toward addressing edge cases, removing
ambiguities and increasing overall consistency.  Several issues of this
type have been in discussion on the mailing list for some time now, and
I am empowering Sean to resolve those issues, not to add new features or
make other major changes.  I reserve the right to veto Sean's decisions,
but I don't expect to need to.

Sean is a natural choice for me to delegate this task to.  He has been
involved in the development of the Gemini specification for longer than
anybody other than myself - he was the first person to actually
implement the protocol in software, transforming it from the largely
academic thought experiment that I had created it as into an actual real
world project.  He is the developer of a Gemini server (GLV-1.12556) and
the admin of a server running it (gemini://gemini.conman.org), which
means the details of the specification are of direct and practical
relevance to him.  He has a long-standing presence in Gopherspace, where
the Gemini project was born, and therefore understands and appreciates
the value of simple-by-design systems with limited scope.  Finally, he
has an excellent track record of constructively engaging with the
mailing list even at its busiest and most frantic, which certainly can
no longer be said for me.  For all these reasons I trust him to make
good decisions on the basis of careful consideration.

I am hopeful that this change will bring us more quickly to a point
where there is no more need for decision making and just the slow, quiet
work of formalisation.  I still hope to be actively involved in that
process myself.

Cheers,
Solderpunk

Subject: Alt text and media types for preformatted text
Message-ID: <YDupbPlTU4MU6fyb@caolan.uk>

Hello all,

This is in response to the various alt-text / content type suggestions floating around.

I'm uncomfortable with inventing a new syntax to combine these two pieces of data for two reasons. First, new syntax complicates the spec. Second, any ambiguity will reduce the usefulness both to a client.

Ideally, the two would be separate. Most suggestions I've seen so far were to follow the opening ``` of a preformatted block with a mix of this data. However, there is also the option of adding data after the closing ``` marker, keeping the two separate.

My suggestion would be to place type information after the opening ```, and alt-text after the closing ```, for the following reasons:

1. Even for accessibility, I suspect knowing the content type is more practically useful to the client in the majority of existing cases. Most ASCII art is purely decoration, and knowing the content type is text/x-ascii (or similar) upfront is important so the screen reader can simply skip it.
2. Knowing the content type upfront would allow clients to present streaming data correctly using appropriate colours and escape codes for code highlighting, for example.
3. Placing the content type after the opening ``` line is familar to markdown authors, which is not a reason in itself, but a welcome bonus nonetheless.
4. Placing the alt text after the closing ```, at the end of the preformatted block has a nice symmetry with links which place the human-friendly text at the end too.

For now, I have no opinion on the format of content type labels.

Caster, amusingly, hast the opposite problem. I can tab to links, but
can't read text with the arrow keys.Using Orca's Flat Review, which just
looks at all objects on the currently visible screen (all objects it can
find, that is), I can read the text, but can't tell with that if
something is a heading, a link, and can't scroll either. I'll keep going
down the list of browsers on

Although I'm skipping terminal browsers for now, as Elpher works fine in
Emacs.

Subject: [spec] Clarify purpose of alt-text
Message-ID: <C9L9A1V1B6AG.S9V3VIW7GKSP@nitro>

Recently there was some discussion regarding the accessiblity of
preformatted text lines. This proposal aims to address those concerns by
simply clarifying the purpose of alt text.

During the discussion John Cowan said:

> I think that most preformatted blocks are meant to be readable.  How about

https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2021/005633.html

I agree with John. I believe that a clarification to the specification
is the best way to resolve this issue.

Alt text should serve one and only one purpose: provide an alternative
text representation of preformatted text. If a block of preformatted
text does not need an alternative text representation (i.e., it can be
read aloud as is), then it should not have any alt text.

Section 5.4.3 of the Gemini specification currently states:

> Any text following the leading "```" of a preformat toggle line which toggles
> preformatted mode on MAY be interpreted by the client as "alt text" pertaining

I propose that the final sentence be removed, and that MAY be replaced
with MUST:

> Any text following the leading "```" of a preformat toggle line which toggles
> preformatted mode on MUST be interpreted by the client as "alt text" pertaining

This would mean that should a screen reader encounter a preformatted text
block with a non-empty alt text, the alt text would be read aloud and the
preformatted block would be skipped. After all, that's what "alternative
text" is supposed to mean.

I disagree - at present the spec lends equal weight to the two possible 
interpretations of the label of the preformatted text areas

 ?- they may be interpreted as an alternative label for screen reader 
(an accessibility label since ascii art is meaningless to non-visual users)
 ?- they may be used for text type identification (to convey the type of 
content shown, for syntax highlighting or possibly more useful semantic 
purposes, for example a client may choose not to render ascii art at all)

The spec does not restrict to a single application or interpretation of 
the label for these preformatted areas. Both elements are important.

It is a reduction in scope to turn the may to a must as you suggest. 
 From an accessibility point of view, you could say that indicating the 
content type is actually more important to screen readers as they can 
definitively use that to choose whether to show the content or not.

The problem is these are orthogonal uses and the spec has them entangled 
together. So the solution is to disentangle. I think the proposal to use 
the opening and closing labels for each purpose (on the other email 
thread) is the best solution so far.

Currently the specification only allows for specifying the language for
computer source code, not for identifying the type of text. So this
would mean expanding the scope of the specification, not restricting it.
I am not really in favor of this.

Are both elements *really* important?

Are there really any content types besides ASCII art that clients would
need to decide whether to show or not?

- Code can be read as-is. I believe that syntax highlighting is not
  really necessary. The language used for the code can be inferred by a
  human from the surrounding text, or the author can write a small
  sentence underneath each preformatted code block describing the code.
- Poems can be read as-is, so should not have any alt text.
- Tables probably do not belong in Gemini text.

In my opinion designating the content type is not really necessary for
the above examples. It is much simpler to treat the presence of alt-text
as an indicator that the preformatted text is not accessible.

This is my main issue: screen readers *do not* skip the block. This will
need to be dealt with by the client, not the screen reader.

To specify the language used in this context is effectively to identify 
the type of text. I cannot believe the specification was literally only 
talking about programming languages in this respect, although that is an 
example.

Well both were considered to be valid applications of the preformatted 
label in the spec.

You might as well ask if I send you a document, is it more important to 
know the media type or the title?

If I was a non-technical person I might very well want not to see source 
code, or to have them "behind a button", at the same time I might like 
to see everyone's ascii art or poetry. These are legitimate preferences 
to be configured into a client.

On the list recently there was a discussion about rendering mathematics 
in gemini. With an appropriate content label an aware client could 
display these in an attractive rendered form.

That could equally be true for ascii art. Put some text around it to 
describe it then use a definitive content type label to indicate what 
type of text it is? Then use the type label to definitively decide not 
to show the art to a non visual user.

The presence of a label on the text area is not definitive of what 
content it contains, so its absence or existence can't completely 
determine whether or not it should be rendered. It is an over 
interpretation of the label's existence.

When using the screen reader, can you tell it to skip n lines?

I see something that could be done in clients as an option (not a default)

For this kind of block for example:

```this is something
some text on multiples lines
```

the client could replace it by a link entry accessing a "virtual" page containing only the text, or opening $PAGER on the content.

=> verbatim-text-#1 [Virtual page] This is something

In case of no alt text this would be seen as

=> verbatim-text-#10 [Virtual page] No alt text

of course, the wording Virtual page is the first thing that came out but I'm pretty sure something better could be found.

No, in most cases. With all GUI and textual screen readers, you can
press Down Arrow n times to skip lines, but it's not automatic. Like,
you can't do like with Emacs (with Emacspeak giving speech output) and
do C-u n C-n to skip lines with other screen readers.

Hi Geminauts,

I needed a Mastodon proxy for Gemini and I think this kind of software 
doesn't exist so I decided to start to write MastoGem. This i written in 
Go, you can view the last 20 toots of an account by providing an ID.

The git repo of this project is here : 
https://git.rdelaage.ovh/rdelaage/mastoGem

You can view a demo here : gemini://rdelaage.ovh:1966

This is WIP but it works.

Any reason why port 1958 is chosen? I was thinking if it's adjacent to 
Gemini (minus TLS) then why not something like 1964? Not unlike XMPP's 
use of 5222 and 5223.

I imagine *some* currently existing Gemini servers could benefit from 
serving Mercury alongside it just because they may not need encryption 
and it would be faster. (Although, I don't know how much TLS slows down 
the connection process, but on my system Gemini pages seem to take a 
while to open.)

You say you have implemented Mercury. Does that mean you have a working 
client and server?

Subject: [spec] Certificate trust
Message-ID: <3718633.9u7rkilq9Z@tempete>

Hello,

I have been using lagrange for a few months to browse Gemini, and I realize that I?m already making a habit of ignoring certificate mismatch warnings, and blindly trusting any certificate that shows.

The certificate trust is one of the weak point of the current specification I think, and it would need to be clarified.

Firstly, there is the idea of TOFU, but it does not say on which part of the certificate the TOFU works (some people consider it?s the whole certificate, some only the fingerprint), and it does not say how much the certificate needs to be valid (I?ve seen on the ML some people considering that a wrong domain in a certificate and a past expiration date should be ignored by clients). Reading the specification it appears that it recommends using fingerprint and to consider past expiration date invalid.
Secondly, there is the good old CA system, nowadays mostly using letsencrypt. It seems badly supported in most clients which still use TOFU in this case and will complain at each renewal.
A third possibility I think would be to use DANE and base validation on the DNS system, but I?ve not seen anyone advocating this, is there anything wrong with that idea?

I?m failing to see how TOFU can provide any security, especially if there is no way to announce a renewal by sending both new and old cert or something, there is a MITM possibility at each renewal. The only TOFU example I?ve seen cited is openssh, which seems offtopic because you usually do not ssh into random machine on the internet by following links like you do with Gemini.

Hi,

I suggested something on IRC a while ago, I'm not sure this would
be a good idea but I'll share it here.

Instead of TOFU, 2 mecanisms could be used:

1) Check chain of trust of the certificate, with let's encrypt and
other provider (they are not alone anymore) it's easy to get a valid
certificate

2) If 1 is invalid, let's (introduce something new here) check if
DNS doesn't have a TXT field with the certificate fingerprint and
see if it matches the current one, accept if OK

3) if 2 found a TXT that doesn't match, tell the user, if it matches,
accepts, if no TXT, TOFU?

The fingerprint published in DNS is already done for SSH fingerprint
using a SSHFP field. This allows to have a third party check. I
agree it's not absolutely perfect but, it gives the opportunity for
an extra check.

This wouldn't have any backward incompatibilities because it's up
to the client to implement it, if a person hosting a gemini server
doesn't want to host it, just do TOFU as usual.

Neither of the two current basic discussions on how to handle this
advocate for any change in the spec - nor should they. There's no reason
to consider it for such, especially when both general concepts offer a
resolution that does not suggest any changes in the spec.

My original suggestion was for a 'convention' that the authors of
clients could find consensus with that will enable the non-sighted
reader to configure that client so as not to render content in between
the preformatted text area of a .gmi file.

That remains my concern. The rest may be worthwhile, or not, but in
either case they involve no changes to the spec.

Whether:

```:

```

or:

```@

```

or:

preformat = "```" [ [WSP] tag ] [ [WSP] alt-text] end-of-line
tag       = '@art' / '@code' / '@data' / '@poem'

None of these involve any mention (and again, nor should they) of a
change in the spec.

This entire discussion evolves around what *some* clients *may*
incorporate (by convention) in the form of a configurable option of
their software so that a block of preformatted text can be opted out
from being rendered in the Gemini browser.

In the first example a single, innocuous character can be keyed upon to
signal that *if* a client has incorporated an opt-out for displaying
blocks of preformatted text for the purposes of user accessability, it
won't display that block of preformatted text to the reader.

It doesn't get in the way of reading raw gemtext, it is hardly noticable
if  you are, and it means nothing but part of the comment that follows
the opening markdown tag, such that it is.

The second example is simply a different character, but part of a more
comprehensive suggestion to accommodate much more than what was my
initial concern for user accessability. That too, is  something that
*may* or may not be adopted by authors of gemini clients.

The third example provides the same as the second suggested solution,
but with a somewhat different approach that may offer more (and I dread
using  this word but I guess I must) extensibility.

Absolutely NONE of the suggestions above have anything at all to do with
a channge in the spec. They do, however, require two things:

1.) Authors of gemini clients will need to decide how they are going to
address this and either alone or with the participation of others on
this list come to a consensus as to how "they" best feel it can be
integrated into Gemini clients, while maintaining the simplicity that
Solderpunk has established is one of the paradigms of Project Gemini.

2.) People who author .gmi files will need to incorporate the
methodology proscribed by the authors of Gemini clients *if* they wish
to participate in making sure that the pages they author assist in the
aim to deliver Gemini content to the non-sighted readers of this world,
and dare I say, given the context of what Gemini is, it stands to reason
that this number will be significant.

Providing what I've just said above. Two things *should* be considered.

1.) the method should be easy to implement in a client, in any language

2.) the method *must* be stupid simple for people like me so that I can
accommodate such user accessibility when authoring my .gmi files.

If you write gemlogs, then I think you prolly agree wholeheartedly with
that second point.



>

> need to decide whether to show or not?

Yes. And they are myriad. Consider log dumps, interminable parts lists
or inventory sheets, perhaps even Microsoft EULAs (because as we all
know, if you're a living breathing organism, you're already
non-compliant with their licenses).

There are a thousand use cases where it might be obvious to the
*Authors* of .gmi files that what they're about to  publish in those
blocks are quite simply, tl;dr.

I'm thinking that what you just suggested is a topic for another
discussion. A discussion where the authors of Gemini clients incorporate
a quick and easy way for the reader to change configurations and refresh
the page they're viewing, in case the reader wants to actually be
presented with what is contained within the preformatted text block.

Example: a non-sighted person wants to install a daemon, but they're a
seasoned sysadmin, so they really don't want to be bothered with all of
the syntax noise of many particular parts  of a tutorial or HowTo on
pulling, compiling and installing the software, most can already write a
server block in Nginx in their sleep - so that would be noise to render
that audibly (I would think), but when they get to the page where the
config.exs file is they may actually want to listen to all of that.

I dunno, even sighted folks skip the parts of code in tuts that they
don't need to bother with.

In any case, that's a 'feature' that the authors of some clients *may*
choose to offer the people that use their software - and as far as the
reader goes, that's really irrespective of whether there's Alt text or
white space following the markdown tag  (Yes, text would be nice, huh?).

So, basically, if you are wondering how many pages Stephanie's LUPA says
are currently in Gemini space, the anser at this moment is 113,310; with
forty something new sites being discovered in the past day or so.

That number's not getting smaller. it's getting much bigger, much faster
 everyday, and at this very moment, that's a lot of .gmi files that
content publishers *may* try to take the opportunity to paste in the
teensy little change to their pages in service to their fellow humans.

So with that in mind, I would suggest that *time is of the essence*, so
that those authoring new pages can get on board with whatever solution
is settled upon (if they choose to do so).

I hope that helps :)

Yes. Bumping the request max size may allow e.g. very simple update

Why this specific requirement? I didn't find any reference to
"urn:*:capa". What does it mean and what would be the returned values?

The same reason Gemini uses 1965: Project Mercury was created in 1958.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury

As for the rest of it, I belive it's kind of silly.  Solderpunk didn't
come up with Mercury as some sort of alternative where they're giving up
on Gemini, they posed it as a hypothetical point of comparison between a
very simple protocol like Mercury and something more complex like
Gemini.  It was never meant to be taken as serious new protocol
proposal, they use it as a marker for another possible position on the
"complexity axis" between Gopher and the web.  Gemini is one point on
that "axis," Mercury is another possible point, used as a reference
beacon to help keep Gemini in-scope.

Project Mercury ran from 1958 - 1963. Gemini uses port 1965 based on
this same homage to the manned space programs leading up the the Apollo
moon landing.

More info on that here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury

And since we're talking port numbers, that brings up another matter.
Stephanie posted (or maybe I just read it  on her page?) about a
collision w/Tivoli on TCP 1965. She referred to  it as a 'serious' conflict.

No offense, but I don't see that as an issue at all. It's a
non-privileged port and there are  several instances where different
types of services use the same ports with respect to UDP or TCP (even in
/etc/services).

I checked /etc/services on Debian Bullseye and Slackware -current just
now and don't see port 1965 or Tivoli even mentioned.

NOTE: This is not to say that it's not relevant or perhaps important to
address, as Stephanie suggests.

Here's something pertinent to that, as well as user accessibility:

```

I dunno about anyone else here, but if I was blind, I sure as hell
wouldn't want to listen to all of that. And as I pointed out in my
immediately previous post, this isn't ASCII-art either.

Remember folks, at this very moment in Gemini space, there are AT LEAST
113,310 pages of content, and that growth is logarithmic ;)

I hope that helps :)

I think this is a sensible way to disentangle these two concerns that 
are covered by the spec. At present these two aspects are merged 
together which means it is hard to write any client code to reliably 
provide any UI to assist the user beyond all or nothing, or a text label.

We had some discussion on this list a while back on some of this, and it 
seems making use of the opening and closing marker was already proposed 
by Sean Conner

https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/002671.html

gemini://gemini.conman.org/test/preformat.gemini

and

Something very close to this was the scheme proposed by Sean in the 
preformat-2 example:

I don't have a strong view on which should be used for the top and which 
for the bottom, I'd just be glad to see the roles clearly separated to 
support both use cases presented in the spec.

 From a parsing point of view I see the benefits in putting the text 
type first as you indicate. There is an argument perhaps to put the alt 
text first which is perhaps that so far the use of this label is mostly 
free form so legacy content would map better to the human alt text 
accessibility label.

> For now, I have no opinion on the format of content type labels.
Given the label is of a text area, we could simply say one can use any 
"sub type" of text media type, so a single word would be text/*

javascript (means text/javascript)
csv (means text/csv)
lua (means text/lua)

and so on. This would be my preference.

Or optionally provide a proper media type if you want (e.g. 
application/atom+xml)

Looking on Wikipedia [1], the only mention of port 1965 is Gemini itself.

IANA claims it's registered to "Tivoli NPM" (presumably Network
Performance Monitoring).  tivoli.com just redirects to ibm.com, and the
Wikipedia page says that Tivoli Software is largely defunct after an IBM
acquisition[0].  IBM even seems to have registered new ports for Tivoli
after their acquisition of it![1]

If it's a big worry, we could try to contact the address given to the
IANA[2] and ask if they could "de-assign"[3] their registration.

I think the following conventions can be adopted instead:

1. Authors of Gemini text are STRONGLY encouraged to add alt text to
ASCII art and other inacessible preformatted text to prevent it from
being read aloud by screen readers. For example:

```ASCII art of a smiley face 
:)
```

2. Code, poems, and other accessible text SHOULD NOT use alt text and
instead prefer to place any descriptive text above or below the
preformatted text. For example:

Here is a code snippet demonstrating how to use print:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

3. Clients should allow the user to skip displaying preformatted text.
Preformatted text with a non-empty alt text should be considered
inaccessible and should not be displayed. Clients can also assume that
any preformatted text without alt-text is safe to display, but might
want to allow the user to skip those as well on a case-by-case basis.

This should be easy for gemtext authors and client authors alike.

I think that in this case the alt-text would probably be better off on
its own line. Alternative text is meant to provide an alternative
representation for imagery and ASCII art, not for textual content. Users
could still choose to skip the preformatted text if they desire. For
example:

Server log:
```
GET /
GET /about.gmi
(more entries...)
```

The client could allow the user to skip displaying the preformatted
text. However, since there is no alt text the preformatted text should
be considered accessible, unlike ASCII art.

I believe that this is the simplest and most elegant approach.

With ssh you can use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSHFP_record

??://??

The multiaddr bellow is the default location of a Mercury (??) service:

/dns4/??.xyz/tcp/1961

A multiaddr describes how to connect to a ?? service ? for example, ? using DNS, ? resolve hostname ??.xyz, and ? connect over tcp ? to  port 1961.

To find a ?? multiaddr, query the host ?? DNS TXT record:

# dig +short TXT ??._tcp.??.xyz.
multiaddr=/dns/??.xyz/tcp/1958/tls/sni/??.xyz

By default, a ?? service runs over TCP, at port 1961 ?

A ??:// request is one-line ?4,096 bytes long at most, UTF-8 encoded? containing a fully qualified, normalized Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI):

??://??.xyz/

An IRI is an UTF-8 version of an Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). 
An URI can be either an Uniform Resource Locator (URL), or Uniform Resource Name (URN).

An example of a ?? request, followed by a text/?? response:

# echo -e '??://??.xyz/\r\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 1961
? text/??;charset=utf-8;
Hello ??!

? ??://??.xyz/license CC0-1.0 
<end of connection> 

A successful ?? response is a one-line with status ??optionally followed by a content type, plus associated attributes, such as encoding:  

? text/??;charset=utf-8;

The content type is optional ? defaulting to text/??, UTF-8 encoded.

The content itself follow the  ? status line ? terminated by the service dropping the network connection.

There are 3 status codes:

? [20] SUCCESS ? one-line, with optional content type, plus attributes, 4,096 bytes long at most, UTF-8 encoded
? text/??;charset=utf-8;

? [30] REDIRECT ? one-line IRI, fully qualified, and normalized, 4,096 bytes long at most, UTF-8 encoded
? ??://??.xyz/

? [40] ERROR ? one-line, 4,096 bytes long at most, UTF-8 encoded, with optional description 
? ??

A text/?? consists of two line types: text, and link. 

A link is denoted as one-line, starting with the infinity symbol (?), followed by a space, followed by a fully qualified, and normalized, IRI ? optionally followed by a space and description:

? ??://??.xyz/license CC0-1.0

All other lines are regular text lines.

A ?? URL may anchor a text/?? line number:

??://??.xyz/license#42

A ?? service may optionally respond to the urn:??:capa directive ? listing additional capabilities, specific to the service, as text/?? links:

# echo -e 'urn:??:capa' | nc 127.0.0.1 1961
? text/??;charset=utf-8;
? urn:??:capa
? urn:??:capa:connection:keep-alive
? urn:??:capa:transfer-encoding:chunked
? urn:??:capa:turn
<end of connection> 

Capabilities are optional, and not part of the ?? protocol. They are documented separately.

# while true; do { echo -e '?\r\n? urn:??:capa'; } | nc -l 127.0.0.1 1958; done
# echo -e 'urn:??:capa\r\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 1958
?
? urn:??:capa
<end of connection> 

That's all folks.

? NASA's Project Mercury was the first human spaceflight program of the United States, running from 1958 through 1963. The first crewed flight took place in 1961. Therefore the port number.

Actually, it's optional. Just a way for servers to advertise additional capabilities, such as persistent connections, or chunked transfer encoding.

The spec dosent have any sytax as of current, it's free form text.
Adding syntax to it it would only remove ambiguity.

Ideally, the two would be separate.

Sticking text after the closing ``` that affects content would break this -
I presume that's why it's explicitly disallowed in the spec.

Code highlighting is a good use case for this - but it would also ~sorta
allow for putting other content inline if we aren't careful on what's
allowed.

I like the ordering of content type first and alt text last, as Gemtext
works line-by-line top-to-bottom, knowing the content type first is good,
as it may affect following stuff.

But I think using the opening/closing toggles like this may cause
confusion, if you look at the line in isolation, you can't tell what the
text following it is. You're supposed to be able to tell how a line would
be structured/it's meaning by only looking at the first three lines.

Agreed, though I would like to see a space character between "```" and the alt text in this case.

I like the approach of being extra clear on what's to come, even to people who don't need the description.

If the code isn't considered accessible, it could be marked with a single word alt text with no whitespace, like this:

 This is how it looks like minified:
 ```javascript

Though, maybe it's better to provide a separate file at that point.

I think there are no disagreements here.

I think this is the perfect use of the TLSA record, instead of introducting
a new use of TXT.  It is already used by DANE to provide trust outside of
the CA structure.

Unless your computer is using DoH or DoT (or DNSSEC?? Not sure) then your DNS
lookup isn't secure either. If your adversary can sit in between your traffic
and change a capsule's TLS certificate than I don't see why DNS would be very
different. Seems like this just adds complexity but without benefit.

  I've been spending the day catching up on the list and thnking about what
needs to be done.  St?phane Bortzmeyer suggested setting up an issue tracker
at some place like Gitlab, and I've done just that.  I set up two
repositories there:

	https://gitlab.com/gemini-specification/protocol
	https://gitlab.com/gemini-specification/gemini-text

to track issues related to the protocol and the text format.  I split them
in two because it made sense to me---the issues of the protocol are largely
orthogonal to that of text/gemini and not everyone has interest in both.  A
bit long term is to split the Gemini specification into two along those
lines, so those that want to discuss content generation don't have to wade
through technobabble of networks and ports and oh my!  

  I've created a few issues already, but gitlab is apparently having issues
of its own right now, so for now, the mailing list is still the place to
bring these up.  Anyway, while I'm here I might as well weigh in on some of
the current proposals.

  First up is favicon.txt.  In my opinion, it does NOT violate the letter of
the spec, given that it doesn't require any changes to the protocol or
text/gemini.  It could be argued that it violates the spirit of the spec,
but I am not willing to endorce nor condemn it.  My decision would be that
clients can support it, but it MUST be disabled by default and require user
intervention in some form to enable it.  On the flip side, those who run
Gemini servers MAY configure their server to return "52 Gone" for requests
to "/facicon.txt" if they do not want to participate in such nonsense (thank
God I was able to convince Solderpunk to add this reponse code back in the
day).  Clients that receive a "52 Gone" for such a request SHOULD NOT make
another request for it.  But those who run Gemini servers SHOULD NOT expect
to see no further requests from a given IP address---there might be several
people sharing an IP, or one user might be using multiple clients.  The
whole intent of serving up a "52 Gone" is to add said server to a list of
servers not to query.  Yes, this is more of an "opt-out" than "opt-in"
situation, but it's hard to opt in to a feature when it's distributed.  This
can be extended to further requests of a similar nature should they come up
[1].  I would like to ask Michael Lazar to please add these changes to his
favicon.txt specification to let others know of the options available.

  Second, alt-text for preformatted blocks.  The original spec did not allow
any text past the "```".  It was later changed for reasons of accessibility,
but intentionally left ambiguous for a consensus to form around it.  I think
disallowing text on the closing "```" is too excessive and I will most
likely rescind that decision to allow more options.  But as for specifying
an actual format in the specification?  No.  Best practice, yes, but a solid
convention needs to arise first.

  Third, meta data for text/gemini.  Again, like alt-text for preformatted
blocks, this isn't something for the specification.  Again, it would be best
for the community to define a convention first.  My own opinion here is that
meta data is always nice (Lord knows I have enough in my blog [2]) but
having been through the "Sematic Web" era, not enough content creators care
enough to actually do the work.

  Fourth, I would like to state that newcomers to the mailing list might not
be aware of the history and context that Gemini was developed in, and think
of Gemini as a "stripped down web" instead of the "souped up gopher" that it
is.  Please keep that in mind as new people make proposals, and instead of a
"No" with no further conversation, say "No, because here's how you could do
it" or "No, because we want a privacy-first stance".  In other words,
explain why the "no".  Or, if nothing constructive comes to mind, don't say
anything and let the proposal die quietly.

  The viability of this approach may depend upon the TLS library used.  I
use libtls, and I really only have two options:

	1. Do the whole CA thang and let the underlying TLS library validate
	   the certificate.

	2. Do no validatation whatsoever, leaving the validation up to the
	   client.

  To do this, I would have to disable validation entirely, and do it
manually, dipping into the nasty API that is OpenSSL.  I would have to check
other servers to see how they are handling this and if I could do the same
thing.

  The general problem with this is not the actual DNS RR used (TXT, SSHFP,
etc), it's making the DNS call itself.  If you haven't dived into the mess
that is DNS and resolving libriaries, it gets about as nasty as TLS with
about a half dozen libraries that aren't compatible at all.  POSIX systems
come with getaddrinfo(), but that only covers A and AAAA record types.  If
you want *any* other type of DNS record, you are pretty much forced to
either use one of the horrible DNS resolving libraries or roll your own.  I
would tout my own DNS library [1], but it's in C (and has a Lua wrapper for
it).

  I'm not saying this is a bad idea.  I'm just saying there are issues with
it ...

So the sighted people with fancy syntax highlighting get to trivially
read it line-by-line, but the people writing accessible software have to
1) seek forward to find the end of the preformatted text block; 2) read
the alt text; then, if the user wants to display the preformatted block
3) jump backwards to the beginning of the preformatted text block and
read it; then 4) skip past the last line of the preformatted text block
so it isn't read again; then 5) continue parsing.

I think syntax highlighting deserves an easier implementation than
accessibility too, so I'm fine with this situation, I'm glad someone
else finally agrees with me on this.

I mean seriously, I like syntax highlighting as much as anyone but
advanced syntax highlighting has to be context-sensitive and possibly
requires looking back in the code block anyways, so might as well put it
at the end, if you have it at all.  But let's just look at the concept
at all for a second: if you really have such a massive block of code
that you need syntax highlighting, just put it in its own file and let
either the browser color it via MIME type or the user can just open it
in their editor.  If your short snippet of code can't be understood
without syntax highlighting then it's probably a problem with your code
rather than the presentation...

Agreed, as someone who isn't vision-impaired, who likes syntax 
highlighting, and who has implemented an Emacs mode that does such 
highlighting.

i feel it's important that accessibility for the vision-impaired 
be easier to support in clients than syntax highlighting. More 
generally, my preference is for gemtext documents to be reasonably 
accessible by default, rather than requiring special efforts to be 
made accessible (as on the Web, where accessibility often plays 
second fiddle to resource-gobbling bling).

I believe what you were looking for can be found here:

https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?&page=35

It is however, of little import IMO, and I'm doubtful any Tivoli servers
are still out there. We had some of that stuff at Filenet when IBM
bought us, basically their vision of LDAP, which was and would be
contained within the confines of an Intranet anyway, certainly, not
something that would be sharing machinery with Gemini servers lol.

BTW, not a lot of folks realize this, but just like Mark Twain was to
Samuel Clemens, IANA was pretty much just a nom de guerre of Jon Postel
prior to his passing. One guy working out of a single office. ICANN made
it an actual body that now either serves, or is served by that
bureaucracy. Ergo, my fav RFC of all time:

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2468

Jon also wrested control of our DNS back from the Government about a
year before he died. Yup! The same Government that's trying to steal it
again. It all started with what we call the MoU, and if you're
interested there's really good coverage of it in Ellen Rony's 'The
Domain Name Handbook'.

So don't forget people, it's private property (the Internet, that is -
all that copper, fiber, and all those 'Cisco' and Big Iron routers), not
public property. Right to pass revocable by owner at anytime. The
Government has no Right of way, and as far as imminent domain goes, I'm
not sure if the fiber or the racks qualify as real estate.

And with that, I'm def going to turn in for the evening and grab a few
hours of shuteye. I'm rambling on about things that died in the 90's.

I hope that helps :)

We are using two different definitions of "security".

SSH, even without SSHFP, still provides security. The question is what is 
the threat model.

Debian's /etc/services is not authoritative for port assignment. It is
clearly said at the beginning of the file that /etc/services is a
*subset* of assignments.

Wikipedia is certainly not the authoritative source on port
assignments. The IANA registry is.

Oh, yes:

So many DNS records to keep track of :)

On the other hand, TXT records are the universal DNS bandaid: easy to use, multi-purpose.

Great. Can we assume that, when an issue will be closed, the text of
the specification in
<https://gitlab.com/gemini-specification/protocol/-/blob/master/specification.gmi>
will be changed too so we can be sure that
<https://gitlab.com/gemini-specification/protocol/-/blob/master/specification.gmi>
is really the current state of the work?

To be honest, code highlighting is probably not that important but it's an easy to understand presentation choice that a client might make. It's probably more important that a client implementing accessibility features understands what type of content is in the block so it can read or navigate it appropriately.  E.g. a table or a poem might be handled differently to ascii art.

As for other content inline - I agree. Preformatted text blocks have always been the biggest extensibility risk in my opinion. They were already the most likely place to put custom client features and this makes it very slightly easier. In the end, our best defence is culture and a plethora of popular clients. Keeping things easy to parse is important for that reason, and I believe an argument for either denying extra data for preformatted blocks, having only one type, or keeping them separate, instead of attempting to combine them with new syntax.

That's not quite true - to know what a line containing ``` will do, you need to know whether your client is in preformatted mode, and this proposal makes no change to the state required.

I agree that the most important principle is that a client choosing to implement accessibility features knows what to do with the following content. That's why I'm proposing content type first.

You might prefer to use the more ambiguous optional alt text and ask the user how to present the data each time. I have no idea if that is correct, someone who relies on a screen reader will have to enlighten me. But don't assume my motives. So far as I can tell, our priorities are the same.

I agree with your statement. With the new issue tracking system that
Sean configured, this is ticket #5
<https://gitlab.com/gemini-specification/protocol/-/issues/5>.

More precisely, each renewal, BY DEFAULT. But Let's Encrypt lets you
request that we keep the public key, and then TOFU will still work iff
it acts on the public key only.

If you use the ACME client dehydrated, this is in the configuration file:

PRIVATE_KEY_RENEW="no"

With the ACME client certbot, this is an option on the command-line:

--reuse-key

This is certainly the best solution, technically
speaking. Unfortunately, adding DANE support to your Gemini client
typically requires some effort, the existing libraries are typically
not sufficient. (Full disclosure: I did not even add DANE support to
my own Gemini client, despites the fact I'm strongly pro-DANE.)

Also, the Internet is very ossified by broken middleboxes (typically
firewalls but not only them) and TLSA requests may be blocked (or,
worse, any DNSSEC use, which DANE requires). This is something to keep
in mind.

I fully agree. TOFU is great for SSH but Gemini is completely
different.

On the web, it is considered good practice to use alt text for images, and there is pressure from the web development community in this regard. Unfortunately, most web users don't actually see alt text in normal use. So it's always going to be a bit of a second class citizen.

One way I think gemini got this right was in using links for images. It requires a textual description of the image, and it's shown to all users. There's no split in the presentation, everyone is treated that same. I like that.

Unfortunately, alt text for preformatted blocks does introduce content only likely to be seen by a minority of users. The only way I can see around that would be a practice of repeating any visual content in prose descriptions in the surrounding paragraphs. This gives reinforcing content that everyone can see. Unfortunately, I don't know how practical that would be in all cases.

But if anyone has an idea to make preformatted blocks more accessible without hidden content for the visually impared, and instead using content shared by everyone, I'd be keen to hear it.

I fail to see the relationship with DoT and DoH. If you care about
integrity and authenticity of DNS answers, DNSSEC is the
solution. (This is why DANE requires it.)

C programmers are lucky, there are two excellent free, documented,

<https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/ldns/> and getdns
<https://getdnsapi.net/>.

Python programmers have one, dnspython <https://www.dnspython.org/>.

Other languages? it depends. Last time I checked for Elixir, it was

Or you can, if you care about the first connection, ask the sysadmin
about the public key to expect, and check it yourself. As C?me
Chilliet explained, that's the *huge* difference between SSH and
Gemini; with SSH, you typically connect to only a few servers and you
know their admins (and they know you).

No need to do manual/extra DNS queries to verify certificates via DANE.

GnuTLS has DANE validation build in
<https://www.gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Verifying-a-certificate-using-DANE.html>

and OpenSSL has that as well
<https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/man3/SSL_dane_enable.html>

I assumed that the content type would be used to decide whether it
would be read.
Anyways, my point was that using the closing ``` is not going to work,
as Gemtext is meant to be read line-by-line.
Whether it's the alt text or content type, having either of them last is flawed.

following this suggestion. Seems like we'd be getting the worst of
both worlds.

How is the type more useful for accessibility than a general
description of its content? Would knowing in an art gallery whether
you're standing in front of an oil painting or an aquarelle be more
useful than knowing what the painting depicts? Need help browsing a
photo album? I'll help! I'll just read "photo, photo, photo, photo,
photo..." to you until you've had enough.

I also object to the idea that the purely decorational should simply
be skipped over. If it's not there for a reason, the author should be
the one skipping over it. Presumably it *is* there for some
informational purpose in which case there's no reason that the
information it communicates should be available to some users but not
others when alt text can be used to describe it to people who can't
see it directly.

A solution to a problem of its own making.

One solution lies within your comment: remove preformatted blocks from 
text/gemini so that we have to link to resources of text/plain or text/
whatever. Just like we do with images etc. 

Probably unpopular but simple, right? Is there a mime type for ascii-art?

Clients would probably load these inline which would result in multiple 
requests, though.

No, but knowing whether the picture contained text or art would tell you whether to use assistive technology to read it or describe it.

It seems most the disagreement here is whether the client should automatically make some sensible choices for the user (content type first), or the user should process the alt text and make their own call (alt text first)?

I like this suggestion.

Personally, if I could choose a client that displayed these inline when clicked I'd be happy. Those preferring simpler clients could simply follow the link.

It would provide both content type and alt text by removing features - the feature that happens to be greatest extensibility risk in gemtext. Ideal.

Reminds me of some threads discussing sophisticated table syntax within 
gemtext vs. linking to such resources, e. g.

Who is right?

I would feel really comfortable building on a existing bloc like DANE as this way there is a lot more chance to see libraries supporting it than if we use something Gemini-specific.

Both :-)

Programmers may not have a version of OpenSSL or GnuTLS recent enough,
or they may use another TLS library, or the binding to GnuTLS/OpenSSL
they use for their favorite programming language may not expose DANE
validation yet.

No one. Everyone. It depends.

It's self-inflicted as well, as Gemini insists on mandating TLS ? without having thought through how to actually use it, nor if it's even relevant to the protocol usage.

It's also dogmatic: not every contexts require TLS. 

It could as well be redundant: different contexts may already provide their own security layer(s).

It may also introduce build-in obsolescence: a few years ago, Gemini would have mandated SSL. What now?

There is an easy way out of this conundrum: move the mechanical details of how to connect to a Gemini service out of the specification.

Provide instead connection profiles, such as Protocol Labs' multiaddr or similar:

https://multiformats.io/multiaddr/

That way, the gory details on how to connect to a Gemini service (THE HOW)  is separated from the Gemini specification itself (THE WHAT).

Not only right, but technically correct. The best kind of correct.

All build-in text/gemini particularities could be removed all at once ? if only Gemini accepted to actually make use of its link construct in more progressive ways.

Of course, this is never going to happen ? too much ideology, and sunk cost already ?.  

Perhaps Gemini is already its very own Big Ball Of Mud:

Latest version of Elaho (1.3, in App Store now) handles preformatted
text better and wraps it with accessibility metadata, using the alt
text if present as title. I tested it with VoiceOver and it seems to
do the right thing. Sometimes it seems to also read the contents of
preformatted text if it looks like words, but not always. In any case,
please let me know if this works better.

But browsers would have to put the code blocks in a container that can be skipped, like a frame so that screen readers can know that this is something that can be skipped. That?s for browsers that use some kind of web engine to show the content. For text browsers, this can?t really be controlled, some screen readers can?t easily skip it.

The Elaho browser, then, could get away with simply putting the preformatted blocks without Alt-text, or Alt-text that isn?t a language ID, in its own element so that can be skipped by moving to the next element (item) with VoiceOver. This is the same with Android with the TalkBack screen reader, and on the Mac, using VoiceOver.

Even if the blocks are marked up in the GemText, it is up to clients to show them. So, if a client just dumps the GemText into paragraphs, and puts the Ascii art in with it, then it is hard to skip. One can quickly arrow line by line until understandable words are spoken, but this is slow and frustrating. Windows and Linux GUI screen readers do have commands to ?skip to end of container,? which are used to skip block quotes, frames, things like that.

Similarly, describing it would tell me whether to read it or skip it
and additionally allow an author to give me the gist of its content.

Read me

```C source code

or

```ASCII art depicting sleeping, happy cat

and I simultaneously have an indicator of whether I can comprehend the
content and a description of it in case I can not. Then I can
consciously navigate past it or dive into it with my client. The
problem with accessibility for now, from what I understand, is that
most clients don't have the navigational tools necessary to allow this,
and screen readers will happily burst out long sequences of nonsense if
that's what's presented to them. This is orthogonal.

> It seems most the disagreement here is whether the client should automatically make some sensible choices for the user (content type first), or the user should process the alt text and make their own call (alt text first)?

Most of my disagreement is with the breaking spec change, further
objections being with the assumptions underlying the definition of the
supposed problem with the spec as-is, but first and foremost that it
suggests a breaking change that is likely to hurt accessibility when a
breaking change isn't at all necessary in the first place.

See my suggestion at the end of the mail for how this can be
implemented without breaking the spec.

What you've suggested here (different lines before and after the
block content contain alt text and type information) creates a problem:
if the type information is after the content, the client can't know in
advance how to e.g. highlight source code. This problem doesn't exist
with the spec in its current form. By saying that the type information
should then be first, you propose to have solved that problem.

In one mail you have both created and solved a problem, and you list
having solved the problem you've created as an advantage of the approach
your suggestion. In that sense it's a solution to a problem of its own
making.

---

My suggestion: if for whatever reason you want to include machine
readable content information, do it on the alt text line as you already
MAY according to the current spec. Do this in a manner that's both
unambiguously separate from alt text to the computer and sensible as
natural plain text and unlikely to appear to mean anything other than
the machine interpretations, e.g. "(MIME: text/x-art)". Define this
format in a companion spec.

It doesn't immediately invalidate any existing pages, it's gracefully
forwards- and backwards compatible and it's already specified to an
extent. Clients that don't want to deal with this time waster can
ignore it, and people who are interested can decide on the color of
their bikeshed (maybe it should be "[MIME: ...]"?!) without constantly
pushing for completely unnecessary breaking spec changes.

IMO escape codes are a hack, and universal client support can't be
expected. In fact, those may break different terminal/client types.

I think color escape codes should not be considered expected with
clients. In fact, there should probably a discussion if this should be
discouraged in the spec.

Right, my apologies. Thank you both for pointing me towards the right 
place to look. I normally use that Wikipedia article to quickly check 
what's what. I had no clue that the IANA registry list even existed 
until now.

Again, thank you both.

These are the signals I want the documentation to send:
(The exact wording can be improved upon.)


# Capsule authors

1. Write a caption for everyone to see.  It should include all information needed for a reader to decide if they want to see the preformated lines or not.

2. The toggle line with free form alt-text.

3. Preformatted lines.  Hopefully not too many.

4. End of file or another toggle line followed by more gemtext.

# Clients

Consider making configuration items for "always show", "always ask" or "ask if it has alt-text, otherwise show" when preformated lines are encountered.

If the reader wants to see the preformated lines, show them.  Otherwise, show the alt-text if it exists.

Put some kind of marker or boundary at the end so that you can skip to it past the rest of the preformated lines.

Awesome, thanks so much for your work! I can definitely recommend it to
other blind people now! I just tested it, and it definitely works great!
I do wish the double-right pointing arrows wasn't there, as VoiceOver
already tells me if something is a link, but that's a very minor thing.
Thanks so much again!

Subject: [ANN] HtmGem, Php program to view Gemini through HTTP
Message-ID: <20210301154208.152ac256@chris-nux>

Hello all,

I made a Php program whose goal is to make Gemini files reachable
through HTTP. It's in Alpha version. I'm still working on it and be
pleased to get remarks, reviews, and so on.

https://git.sr.ht/~sbgodin/htmgem

This Php program :

1. Fetches the name of the Gemini page you asked. 
2. Translates it into HTML, using a custom CSS.
3. Delivers it to your browser.

This way, it's possible to work on Gemini files and make them available
through Gemini and the web.

I applied this to my own small set of pages:

https://gmi.sbgodin.fr/gemlog
gemini://gmi.sbgodin.fr/gemlog

If I had to answer yes/no (or please y/n in Terminal browsers) if I want
to see code blocks every time, that'd quickly get annoying. I'd rather
just hide them all, Alt-text or not, and expand them with a key press
when I reach one I want to read. This key press would expand the
currently focused block, not all of them, of course.

That?s great! Arrows will be fixed in the next version. If you have any
other accessibility issues, feel free to reach out privately.

Hi!

Yet another Gemini Server: SpaceBeans.

It is built with Scala and Akka Streams, and I plan to make it both 
useful (it is already) and experimental (trying some wild ideas, as I 
have free time).

For more info, please visit:

- gemini://capsule.usebox.net/spacebeans/
- https://github.com/reidrac/spacebeans

Running on the JVM is not going to be your first choice if you're 
looking for a lightweight service, but I made it as a learning exercise 
and I'm releasing it as open source. If nobody but me uses it at the 
end, that's OK!

Kind regards,

Juan

Subject: [tech] gemnet a gemlog YYYY-MM-DD based usenet-like network
Message-ID: <20210301172016.GA28879@uranium>

First of all my apologies if this has already been discussed before.

After a long time consuming gemlogs by subscribing to gemini pages that
comply with the widely adopted subscription convention described here:

gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/companion/subscription.gmi

I can't help but notice that at their core, email and usenet show a
similar pattern to index.gmi files inside gemlog folders when presenting
an index of messages to the user, perhaps with the exception that they
also show a from address, in addition to a date and a subject.

Does anyone think it would be useful to have a gemnet folder inside our
capsules, in a similar fashion to gemlog, using the same subscription
convention as mentioned above, but perhaps adding a "from" field like
this:

/gemnet/index.gmi:

#gluon's gemnet

=> hello_gemnet!.gmi 2021-03-01 - Hello gemnet! - gluon
=> another_message.gmi 2021-03-02 - Another message - gluon
=> one_more_message.gmi 2021-03-03 - One more message - gluon
=> re:and_now_a_reply.gmi 2021-03-03 - Re: And now a reply - gluon
=> re:and_now_a_reply_2.gmi 2021-03-03 - Re: And now a reply - gluon
=> re:and_now_a_reply_3.gmi 2021-03-03 - Re: And now a reply - gluon

That renders as usual:

#gluon's gemnet

2021-03-01 - Hello gemnet! - gluon
2021-03-02 - Another message - gluon
2021-03-03 - One more message - gluon
2021-03-03 - Re: And now a reply - gluon
2021-03-03 - Re: And now a reply - gluon
2021-03-03 - Re: And now a reply - gluon

This looks like a very simple way to post messages and replies in a
"semi-distrubuted" way, making use of Gemini as the underlying transport
mechanism. Distributed in the sense that messages would live only within
the server of each author.

Then, anyone interested in the messages of a particular author would
make use of clients that allow YYYY-MM-DD subscriptions or run local
aggregators with such feeds to be able to see the messages. Posting
messages or replies would be elegantly the same as posting a gemlog
entry, using whatever mechanism you already use for that. That said,
specialised clients could also easily be developed to make use of this
convention and allow an interface more similar to an email/usenet
client if desired.

One further convenience of this "network architecture" is that SPAM is
easily avoided, since that by design, you need to opt-in to any person's
feed and you won't see the messages of anyone you haven't subscribed to.
Think of a killfile from usenet but in reverse.

I mentioned a separate folder called gemnet, but in reality gemlogs are
so generic that we could use them as they are. After all, any gemlog
post could be a message itself. Using the current gemlog folders would
even make it very easy to reply to gemlog posts, something many people
often feel the need to. However, maybe this approach would create too
much SPAM, so I think having a separate gemnet folder is more
reasonable?

I guess that's it. Once again sorry if this makes no sense at all, or
has already been discussed. On the other hand, if you resonate with the
concept, I'm willing to create my own gemnet and subscribe to anyone who
does the same. We could experiment communicating using Gemini this way.

In all of my life I used ssh to administer servers which had been my own 
or had been owned by the company I had been working on. So, if I set up 
a server from scratch I always did know exactly, why my ssh did warn me 
  about a mismatch.

Using servers of others gives a totally different situation. I don't 
know anything why or by whom a certificate had been changed. Anyways, if 
I gave trust to somebody the first time, why should I not trust him the 
next time? No matter for me if I'm just reading Gemini pages.

I wrote GAMS specification which is a bit close to your idea, but with boards to hold threads on specific subjects.

See gemini://gemlog.lanterne.chilliet.eu/2021-01-07%20[gams-en]GAMS-board-system.en.gmi

It did not get much traction though and there is no active board for now.
I do hope to start a french one at some point, but I need to find motivated gemlog authors.

Thanks for sharing. The concept seems quite similar indeed. Maybe the
idea of exchanging messages isn't something that necessarily appeals
Gemini users, who maybe see email as good enough for that.

Regardless of that, I find all these simple conventions so elegant and
generic enough that I can think of all sorts of systems based on them.
I'll read more about GAMS.

  My current thinking is a switch to IRI once some details are ironed out. 
People who are concerned about this can voice their concerns on the list
here, or (more preferrably) in the issue tracker for this:

	https://gitlab.com/gemini-specification/protocol/-/issues/1

  Rational:  Since Gemini is geared around UTF-8, it's weird that the only
aspect that currently can't be UTF-8 are links.  The change from URI to IRI
is pretty minimal except for the use of IDN (International Domain Names) and
DNS resolution.

Regarding Gitlab issue #2 "TLS Close", may we ease client and
server implementations by:

1. Not requiring client applications to send TLS close_notify,
since they indicate end-of-data via the request <CR><LF> ?

2. Only requiring server applications to send TLS close_notify
if all data has been sent? If the TCP or TLS connection is
interrupted by the client or by an intermediary before the server
application has transmitted all of its data, there doesn't
seem to be a benefit to sending a close_notify to the client
and it could also cause various delays which prohibit the server
application from moving on to other work. For example, an
unending streaming response would be closed by the client,
in which case there is no need for a close_notify from the server.

  I've talked on this before (several times in fact) and my stance is that
controls codes aside from HTAB, CR and LF should not be used in text/gemini. 
There's the issue that "color escape codes" are an artifact or side effect
of a terminal-based Gemini browser and it can't be relied to even exist in
the graphical browsers that are popping up.  Then there's the security
issue---there are escape codes that can reprogram the keyboard, and although
the usage is rare, it is possible.  There are also escape codes that can
resize the window and reposition the window, and there's no telling what
state the terminal can end in.

  While I would like to disallow control codes in the specification, that
might be too big of a change, and *will* affect some sites, but adding
verbiage that discourages it can be added.

The effect of this is that clients MUST send close_notify after writing
their a request in order to properly comply with TLS 1.3.  I would
operate under the assumption that a server would not send a response
until a close_notify is received (or the request would be allowed to
time out).  Obviously a robust server would work without a close_notify,
but you should still operate within the spec because I'm wouldn't be
surprised if at least one or two TLS implementations require it.

There's even stronger wording for TLS 1.2 which requires a close_notify
after writing is completed and for /both/ the sending and receiving
parties to send a close_notify after the transaction is completed, so
the client would have to send a close_notify after the both request and
the response, not just the request.
See: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.2.1

The whole point of close_notify is to indicate that the write has
successfully been completed.  I may be misunderstanding your question,
but if the connection is interrupted then a close_notify should not be
sent, as that would erroneously report that the transaction was
successfully completed.  For streaming data I assume that it would be
properly terminated by the client closing the connection since the data
is never completely sent (it's unending).


I'm no TLS expert, I'm just reporting what I found after skimming the
TLS RFCs, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here.

Fantastic.

Second question: is there any reasonable way to decouple the Transport Layer Security requirement from the Gemini protocol itself?

Perhaps this is the wrong way to frame this, but you're prioritizing backwards compatibility on a pre-1.0-spec to support an unintended hack that has security issues?

If I had control codes on my capsule, I'd grumble a bit, sure, but I'd remove them. I'm not sure it's worth it to shield the tiny handful of **current** capsule operators from some search-and-delete work compared to all the future client implementors who'll face at least some pressure to implement color support (and, if they're actual terminal applications, open their users to keyboard-reset exploits).

Hi Alex. I would like to follow the RFC too.

After writing C and Python client and server implementations
last fall, and examing packet traces, my conclusion was that
this does not work with most TLS libraries. Mostly, they will
close the connection in both directions if they receive a
close_notify. Some of this is documented here [1]. This in
turn causes problems for programming languages which
expect a given library to behave in a certain way. For example,
Python still does not allow sending a close_notify from the
client after the request has been delivered and before
receiving the response [2].

So, in my opinion, the simplest thing would be to utilize the
<CR><LF> of the Gemini request to indicate that the client
is finished sending its request.

Three benefits of this approach would be:

1. All Gemini clients will keep working right now without changes

2. Because the <CR><LF> can be explicitely sent by a client
application and explicetely examined by the server application,
without broken TLS libraries intervening, it is easy to correctly
implement

3. Gemini client authors will not experience intense frustration
at the sad state of TLS library support for half-open close_notify
(this is the voice of experience speaking...)

Yes I agree. It doesn't matter to me how it is worded, as
long as its clear that a close_notify doesn't need to be sent
from the server to the client unless the server application
has been able to send all data that it wants to send first. So
in the case of streaming, since the server didn't reach the end
of the unending data stream, it would not send close_notify, it
would just immediately close the TCP connection.

  Frankly, half-open is borked for TCP pretty much as well, due to the
semantics and operation of the Bezerkly sockets API, so that's not new.

  If I recall, escape codes where *never* in any of the specifications, just
an oversight when documenting the format (aka "loophole").

  I'd ban control codes in a heartbeat (except for HTAB, CR and LF as
stated), but I'm not sure how popular that decision would be.

  Short answer:  no.

  Long anser:  If you want to explore alternative transport security
methods, go to town with an implementation, get the crypto community to pass
it and *then* present it to the Gemini community.  At that point, the
discussion can commence.

One of the primary motivations of Gemini was adding TLS to gopher, and to
avoid the whole http: vs https: that infests the web.

I do vaguely recall seeing some funny things at the TCP level in
those packet traces.

If so, that could be be another reason to not require the server
to send close_notify unless it is able to send all the data first.

I would support it. I think this step would work best if coupled with
best practices or code example for clients to identify and ideally
remove or warn/error if encountered. The client that I'm working on is
ncurses-based and doesn't support escape codes for that reason. But
maybe a visible difference to text without escape code would be enough
to weed out existing escape code hacks. A simple way would be to guide
clients to how to print the escape codes as plain text rather than
processing them. Could probably come up with a simple regex/tr to get
started...

Message-ID: <20210302021334.GN9315@brevard.conman.org>


  To give the "TLS close" issue some context:  The Gemini protocol does not
indicate how big a given response is, mimicking gopher and the very early
HTTP protocol.  In gopher with a non-binary file being transferred, a "." on
a line by itself indicates "end-of-file" and for binary files, it's up to
the client to keep reading until the stream is closed (RFC-1436 states as
much: " Note that for type 5 or type 9 the client must be prepared to read
until the connection closes.  There will be no period at the end of the file
...").  Gemini inherited this model and no attempts to include a reponse
size has been accepted.

  So, all a client has to go by in Gemini that a file was sent correctly, is
to wait for the server to close its side of the connection, as signaled by a
"TLS close".  This means that issues with the network between the two
endpoints (a router crash) are caught, as well as the server crashing before
it can send a "TLS close."

  Then someone noticed that TLS include semantics of "this side is closed"
and thus, why the server is expected to close the connection, not the
client.  Also, it was never an expectation that the client close its side
after making a request.

  Hopefully, this provides enough background on this topic from a Gemini
perspective.

  I posted a BNF format for the C1 control codes here:

	https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/000390.html

  For the C0 set, just filter out anything between character 0 and 31, with
the exception of HTAB (9), LF (10) and CR (13).

I'm not in any way a TLS expert, but I think you're right: TLS 1.2 uses 
a duplex-close policy (while TLS 1.3 uses a half-close policy, so that 
should work better).

IMHO the spec should probably refer to the RFC when available and 
perhaps make a recommendation, but getting into specific details on how 
the TLS implementation must behave is hairy and probably not practical.

As long as the spec is clear, real world can differ and still work, and 
that's OK.

Juan

Let me rephrase the question: would it be possible to edit the Gemini specification in such a way that it makes TLS a SHOULD, not a MUST.

This is purely an editorial adjustment, which would leave the door open for alternative transport layer  beside TLS.

Thoughts?

  If you want to explore alternative transport security methods, go to town
with an implementation, get the crypto community to pass it and *then*
present it to the Gemini community.  At that point, the discussion can
commence.

  Until such time and discussion show the new method to be viable, safe and
easy to implement, TLS will remain a MUST.  I do NOT want to encourage
anyone to create some halfbaked crypto scheme and make things worse.

Hi,  

  

i trust that this is a suitable forum for saying that i'm much taken with the
gemini protocol concepts and as a result started a gemini server:
gemini.mingmengtou.org. a few project firsts for me: using a dynamic dns,
server on home router, gemini server, and a few more to get that far.
gemini.mingmengtou.org (after a few hurdles) ran 24 hr without fail and is now
serving after reboot and switching to server and dynamic dns script as
services. running on a pi 3b+ minimal rasbian.  

  

Cheers  

  

Neil

Very motherly of you. Thank you for your concern. :)

As already mentioned several times over the last several months: in my case, everything runs over wireguard+tailscale [1][2] ? making TLS redundant and unwelcome.

"Remembering the LAN" explains the operating principle:
https://tailscale.com/blog/remembering-the-lan/

In short, this is not about (re)inventing some "half-baked crypto", but rather to use existing ones, which happen not to be TLS at all.

No drama though... I do not mind one way or another as for as Gemini goes ? I have fully moved on and adopted+adapted Mercury for my own needs.

Just thought it would be polite to explicitly point out the corner you are painting yourself into :)

No worries though... all good :)

Wish you a very pleasant day.

  I only have one question for you then---IF I allowed TLS to be optional,
how would a client know to use TLS, Wireguard or say, Tor?

  Good luck with your endevours.  And if I find myself painted into a corner
with Gemini, I know who to call.

Subject: [spec] avoiding the transport layer security trap
Message-ID: <2DE8C080-4795-465E-9EBC-FF9CDF0F9372@gmail.com>

It has been made abundantly clear that Gemini has no appetite whatsoever to untangle the protocol itself from its chosen transport layer, namely TLS.

So be it.

This is very much in line with older protocol designs such as HTTP vs HTTPS.

Some design mistakes become to entrenched they become best practices :)

https://dilbert.com/strip/2008-09-03

IPFS ?the modestly named InterPlanetary File System? shows another way:  by abstracting the connection mechanism from the protocol itself.

Specifically, the 'how' of connecting to a service is abstracted by describing its details with multiaddr.

For example, accessing a Gemini service over a plain tcp connection could be specified as:

 /dns4/host.xyz/tcp/1965

While accessing the same Gemini service over TLS+SNI could be specified as:

/dns/host.xyz/tcp/1965/tls/sni/host.xyz

Finally, something like DNS service discovery can bootstrap the entire process by advertising what specific multiaddr applies to a given Gemini host:

dig +short TXT _gemini._tcp.host.xyz.
multiaddr=/dns/host.xyz/tcp/1965/tls/sni/host.xyz

That's all folks.

Subject: [spec] gemini capabilities
Message-ID: <851127AD-AC16-4EF8-B3A6-F67A3514C770@gmail.com>

It has been made abundantly clear that Gemini is meant to be a frozen, immutable protocol ? without any possible extensions whatsoever. 

The forever protocol.

So be it.

Nevertheless, here is the outline of a small extension mechanism for Gemini: CAPA, short for capabilities.

CAPA manifest itself as a directive, expressed as an URN:

urn:gemini:capa

The CAPA directive itself returns a list of capabilities supported by a given service, if any, or an error code otherwise:

C: urn:gemini:capa
S: 20 text/gemini
=> urn:gemini:capa
=> urn:gemini:capa:connection:keep-alive
=> urn:gemini:capa:transfer-encoding:chunked
=> urn:gemini:capa:turn
<end of connection>

In this case, the service understand CAPA itself, plus a handful of other capabilities, such as persistent connection, and chunked transfer encoding.

A client enable a give capability by sending the relevant directive to the service:

C: urn:gemini:capa:connection:keep-alive
S: 10 Continue

To which the conformant service replies with an informational status code ?10 Continue? acknowledging the new capability.

In this example ?with the keep-alive capability enabled? the network connection is persistent and not dropped to indicate end-of-transmission after each request.

Additionally, keep-alive enables the chunked transfer encoding ?  as now the Gemini service needs a different mechanism to indicate end-of-transmission to the client.

Wrapping all this together:

C: urn:gemini:capa:connection:keep-alive
S: 10 Continue
C: gemini://host.xyz:/life-is-a-long-quiet-river.gmi
S: 20 text/gemini;charset=utf-8;connection:keep-alive;transfer-encoding=chunked;

Taking one example from the list, https://nypost.com/terms/ has the

[..]

I imagine other publications have something similar

Previous discussion on a similar subject -

And a quote from Louis from the same thread:

> I think Gemini should be known for genuine content and services, not stripped-down copies and bridges from the http world.

Now if you were using a public API exposed by these publications (if
it exists) and explicitly allow this use case, I think that would be
very much welcomed.

All details are similar to gemini itself, ? some minor adjustments.

????????????

??://??

By default, a ?? gemini service runs over plain TCP, at port 1961.

A ?? gemini:// request is one-line ?4,096 bytes long at most, UTF-8 encoded? containing a fully qualified, normalized Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI):

gemini://host.xyz:1961/

An IRI is an UTF-8 version of an Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). 
An URI can be either an Uniform Resource Locator (URL), or Uniform Resource Name (URN).

????????????

An example of a ?? gemini request, followed by a ?? text/gemini response:

# echo -e 'gemini://gemini.xyz:1961/\r\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 1961
20 text/gemini;charset=utf-8;
Hello ?? Gemini!

=> gemini://host.xyz:1961/license CC0-1.0 
<end of connection> 

A successful ?? gemini response is a one-line with status 20?optionally followed by a content type, plus associated attributes, such as encoding:  

20 text/gemini;charset=utf-8;

The content type is optional ? defaulting to ?? text/gemini, UTF-8 encoded.

The content itself follow the  20 status line ? terminated by the service dropping the network connection.

????????????

There are 3 status codes:

20 SUCCESS ? one-line, with optional content type, plus attributes, 4,096 bytes long at most, UTF-8 encoded
20 text/gemini;charset=utf-8;

30 REDIRECT ? one-line IRI, fully qualified, and normalized, 4,096 bytes long at most, UTF-8 encoded
30 gemini://host.xyz:1961/

40 ERROR ? one-line, 4,096 bytes long at most, UTF-8 encoded, with optional description 
40 ??????

????????????

A ?? text/gemini consists of two line types: text, and link. 

A link is denoted as one-line, starting with the arrow symbol (=>), followed by a space, followed by a fully qualified, and normalized IRI ? optionally followed by a space separated description:

=> gemini://host.xyz/license CC0-1.0

All other lines are regular text lines.

?? Gemini is a ? strict subset of Gemini proper.

In other words, a compliant Gemini agent should be able to handle all of ?? Gemini ? while a ?? Gemini agent can only handle a small subset of the whole of Gemini, gracefully degrading along the way.

?? Gemini attempts to follow Antoine de Saint-Exup?ry's dictum: design is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

The approach was outlined in Solderpunk's seminal "The Mercury protocol" gemlog, dated 2020-05-26. ?

The most apparent difference between ?? Gemini and Gemini proper relates to the connection mechanism: 

? ?? Gemini run over plain TCP by default
? Gemini proper mandates TLS in all circumstances

The port numbers are therefore different: 

? 1961 for ?? Gemini, over plain TCP
? 1965 for Gemini proper, over TLS

Aside from that, the differences are pretty minor:

? ?? Gemini sports only 3 status codes (20 SUCCESS, 30 REDIRECT, and 40 ERROR)
? Gemini proper sports ~18 status codes

Another difference of note is related to IRIs/URIs:

? ?? Gemini mandates absolute, normalized IRIs everywhere
? Gemini proper allows relative URIs, in some cases

In regards to text/gemini, ?? Gemini recognize only two line types: text, and link. 
Furthermore, the ?? Gemini links are always absolute, and normalized.

Gemini proper sports a few more line types (preformatting toggle lines, preformatted text lines, heading lines, unordered list items, and quote lines).
The regular Gemini links can be relative, under some circumstances.

Very similar altogether, connection mechanism aside (plain TCP vs TLS).

Other differences are more philosophical in nature:

? ?? Gemini advocates a more flexible connection model, using multiaddr + DNS-SD 
? Gemini proper mandates TLS, in all cases ? all the way down to protocol specific status codes (the 6x series)

Finally, there is the open vs close nature of the respective protocols:

? ?? Gemini advocates a cooperative extension model (through capabilities negotiation)
? Gemini proper is firmly locked down and frown at any hint of possible extensibility ? the forever protocol

All in all, quite similar in practice, while quite different in outlook.

unhappy with the /really contentious/ parts of Gemini like TLS and DNS.
They seem to be one of those people that hate something but still hang

I do understand their views on IRI because not having IRIs is rather
silly.  The IRI thing's going to be resolved one way or another sometime

Subject: [user] Putting my blog on gemini, question about subdomains
Message-ID: <MUnejTQ--3-2@snowymouse.com>

Hello!

I heard of the wonderful Gemini protocol a while ago, and I've decided to put my blog on Geminispace!

gemini://snowymouse.com

I may put other resources on here later for some of my other open source projects, but I've decided to just start out with my blog. The server software I'm using is something I've mostly written from scratch in C++, and it presently serves no actual files on the SSD - just my blog posts from a MySQL database (either?converted from markdown or written in native gemtext), a status page, and a contact page.

Anyway, my question is... is it better to use a subdomain (i.e. gemini.snowymouse.com) or to continue using the main domain (i.e. snowymouse.com)? I've been lurking on this mailing list for a while, and I've been seeing a lot of new capsules using either, so I wasn't sure!

As a side note, I consider the HTTP and gemini blog functionally identical since, besides differences in formatting, they're functionally identical, which is why I defaulted to just using the same hostname.

Many thanks,
Snowy

I would say: if you can, use your main domain. Sharing it would share
both your web and gemini presence :)
In the end, I doesn?t matter much, go with the most practical solution
for you!

Ha ha - be careful with remarks like that equating HTTP and gemini - 
these sort of statements can be considered as blasphemy round these here 
parts! :)

Just host them however it makes sense to you. Sometimes it makes sense 
to use a different sub domain if it is different content - more easily 
moved around perhaps. But if it is all coming out of the same database, 
that seems less of an issue.

Note that HTTP has this issue (HTTP 1.1? 1.2? Soon 1.3 which does not
even use TCP?) It is "solved" by some mixture of signaling in the DNS
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-https/>,
redirection when possible (Alt-Svc:) and intelligent guessing, probing
and memorization by the client.

Note that we may have to address the QUIC issue. The RFCs on QUIC (a
transport protocol, alternative to TCP, with mandatory crypto) are
almost published, and we may have to consider wether to use it. QUIC
is very targeted towards the Web (for instance with multiplexing
because, unlike Gemini, Web pages are made of several resources) so it
may be better to ignore it, that's something to think about.

As said by others: do what you want.

The Lupa crawler <gemini://gemini.bortzmeyer.org/software/lupa/> knows
725 working capsules and only 80 of them has a name starting with
'gemini.' or 'gmi.'. But of course there are other subdomains (4
'capsule.').

Choosing the apex of your domain has pros:

* shorter and simpler URLs
* some people like that more

And cons:

* forces you to keep your Gemini capsule on the same machine as your
Web site (or to use a proxy in front of them)
* inconvenient if your capsule name is an alias to another domain, for
instance to your hoster (aliases at the apex are not easy)

Unfortunately, Gemini (like the Web) does not use the SRV records,
that would solve everything.

Using the existing feature of your MUA (Mail User Agent) to ignore
automatically messages from this person seems a more reasonable
choice.

thanks for sharing! It's nice to be able to access these through Gemini and to be able to jump to the HTTP site if needed.

one suggestion: it'd be really nice if the article listings led with the date, so that we could subscribe to individual sites if we wanted to

Goodness, well, yes, I meant just the blog (the posts), not the protocols!

Of course, for some posts, I may need to change things like links, lists, tables, and other things for the gemini version in order to convey the same information effectively. And there is styling on the HTTP/HTML site where no such styling is necessary (or possible) on gemini/gemtext. This requires a little bit of extra care sometimes, but since most of my content is just headings and text, anyway, it's rarely a problem.

That said, I do use a HTTPS server (with IP filtering) to modify/submit articles to the blog, particularly a PHP tool called Adminer. I, of course, don't really see myself comfortably making entire posts in under 1024 characters using only one line (though I'm sure writing an editor that has you submit multiple lines wouldn't be impossible, if convoluted).


> Just host them however it makes sense to you. Sometimes it makes sense to use a different sub domain if it is different content - more easily moved around perhaps. But if it is all coming out of the same database, that seems less of an issue.
>
As far as websites go, when I think of switching between two different protcols (for example, HTTP and HTTPS but not necessarily HTTP and SCP), my thought process was receiving the same content but in a different way, which is sort of what I was going for here.

Anyway, I'll keep using this! Thank you!

I've heard this suggestion before and at the moment it's probably best
to just subscribe to the RSS feed of the site itself, as that's all we
do to fetch the current "recent articles"

  My stance on QUIC is the same replacing TLS.  When someone finally gets
Gemini running over QUIC, then we can discuss it.  Until then, there's
nothing to discuss.  Besides, I doubt the Gemini community will go for it
(famous last words).

The Guardian are a lot more cool with it. To get an API key on their
open platform, you need to jump through some hoops and get approval. But
in principal they're not against having their content redistributed.

https://open-platform.theguardian.com/

Unfortunately, its not possible to follow their requirements to the
letter using Gemtext. For example, you're not allowed to mess with the
HTML, and you need to show a "Powered by The Guardian" image.

I'm not using the API for gemini://guardian.shit.cx, but I eventually
intend to eventually conform more closely to the conditions of open
platform.

By the way, I really like Simple News. Great work.

??://??

Toward the end of his seminal "The Mercury protocol" gemlog ?, Solderpunk raises the following questions:

? How much more difficult is Gemini to implement than Mercury?
? What are the things Gemini can do which Mercury cannot?
? How much do we value those things?
? Is the difference in implementation effort commensurate with the value of the extra abilities gained?
? Is there anything Mercury can do which Gemini can't?


With a concrete ?? Gemini definition at hand, we can now compare and contrast it with Gemini proper:

?? gemini ? a minimalist gemini protocol
https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2021/005851.html

?? gemini ? esthetics
https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2021/005852.html


? HOW MUCH MORE DIFFICULT IS GEMINI TO IMPLEMENT THAN MERCURY?

Both are trivial to implement ? everything else being equal. 

?? Gemini is more essentialist than Gemini proper ? less moving parts overall
?? Gemini doesn't mandate TLS by default ? Gemini's albatross
?? Gemini text/gemini is more streamlined, with only one essential construct: the link


? WHAT ARE THE THINGS GEMINI CAN DO WHICH MERCURY CANNOT?

None. 

?? Gemini can run over TLS like Gemini proper, given the appropriate multiaddr support: /dns/host.xyz/tcp/1965/tls
?? Gemini can express all of Gemini various line types solely using the link construct
?? Gemini can do all of what Gemini proper can ? just differently


? HOW MUCH DO WE VALUE THOSE THINGS?

Depends who "we" is.

Technically speaking, there are no capabilities differences ? it all boils down to esthetics and sensibilities.


? IS THE DIFFERENCE IN IMPLEMENTATION EFFORT COMMENSURATE WITH THE VALUE OF THE EXTRA ABILITIES GAINED?

?? Gemini has a more focused value proposition than Gemini proper ? which doesn't add any extra abilities per se. Both protocols do the same ?just differently. 


? IS THERE ANYTHING MERCURY CAN DO WHICH GEMINI CAN'T?

Yes.

?? Gemini frees Gemini proper from its TLS albatross ? a significant simplification
?? Gemini introduces a flexible connection mechanism ? multiaddr
?? Gemini is conceptually more consistent and streamlined ? the very essence of Gemini

In conclusion:

?? Gemini can do more with less
?? Gemini embodies the essential qualities of Gemini proper


That's all folks.

HTTP sports the HEAD method ? which returns only the headers of a response, without the content itself:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/HEAD

HTTP GET and HEAD are semantically equivalent: GET returns both headers and body, while HEAD only returns the headers of the response.


Gemini proper doesn't formally offer anything equivalent: a 20 response is an all or nothing proposition ? the equivalent of an HTTP GET only.

In practice though, a Gemini HEAD request simply means a Gemini agent  reading only the response status line ? and ignoring the content itself.


?? Gemini offers the following implementation suggestion to ?? Gemini agents: 

? For clients ? drop the connection immediately after reading the status line 
? For servers ? double check the network connection status before sending the content itself, perhaps even delaying it slightly 


That's all folks.

I think alot of the bad reputation also comes from YouTubers that
misunderstand what Gemini is.

Looks very much unrelated:

Think, Decentraland, mixed with GoogleMaps, mixed with Yelp, then throw in a unique rewards based contribution model (People over Profits, can I get an Amen?). Add a little sprinkle of Geocaching then get a shotgun and pump it full of awesome AR stuff and you are like half as cool as this is going to be. Be a part of something cool and get paid to do it!

A bunch of Lorem ipsum as well :D

Much better branding for sure:

We, as a project (Simple Web) try to avoid using official APIs,
especially if they require API keys and such because we want our
software to be able to be run by everyone without requiring an API key
or developer account or such. SimplyNews is not just a gemini service,
but also available as a web service and (in the works) a desktop
application. This is why it would be unsuitable to use API keys.

> gemini://guardian.shit.cx

I really like that, especially because it allows you to choose the RSS
feed you want to look at (we have something like this planned, and we
call it "sections" but it's far from being implemented due to lack of
time)

> By the way, I really like Simple News. Great work.

I think it's moe of the irony of cheaping somebody else's name (and protocol) and registering the domain with NameCheap :D

I don't think size or hash data in the response is going to enable this
unless you are going to man-in-the-middle the TLS connection that gemini
rides on top of.  In this respect it is really no different than the
problem with proxies and HTTPS.

It's easy enough to filter people that leave a bad taste in your mouth.
Personally, I often filter top-posters, because that's just about the
most offensive thing to me, breaking the context of a conversation.

But that's just me.

By all means, if someone is just spewing noise to you, just send them to
/dev/null - it's like they no longer exist. Sure, you might see them
being quoted here and there but that's about it.

But please don't let someone else sour your own experience here.

One of the reasons I most admire your tact and approach to opportunities
for solutions (aka: problems).

"Show me. If it works, then let's talk."

Case in point: BBN. Yeah, the IP stack that didn't stack up. Bill Joy is
famous for answering the question posed to him with, "It's simple. You
just read the specs and write the code" (paraphrased, of course).

I'm confident that Solderpunk found this about your character as an
important reason why he delgated AUTH to you for this part of the
project. You put your keyboard where everyone's discussions were and
wrote https://github.com/spc476/GLV-1.12556

It makes for a strong point of advocation when this happens, for pretty
much anything.

Subject: Greek characters in query string
Message-ID: <20210304025707.GE3836848@op7040>

I have a cgi script in which the query string has both English characters and Greek characters.

For example, the user may enter in the input box Matt1/???

When the url with the query string is sent to the server (I am using Molly Brown the server and amfora as a client) it is changed the Greek characters using url encoding.

I am wondering how to I decode the url to get back the Greek characters.  I am using bash for my scripts.

Thank you.

If that's actually what the server is sending back to you then you might
want to consider: https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/molly-brown/issues

The server (MollyBrown) should do it for you :-( but if it doesn't, in
bash, you have several solutions:

One way to decode using plain sh scripts is to substitute each % with \x
and pass the string to printf, but I don't know how solid it can be in
the real world

	$ QUERY_STRING='caf%C3%A8'
	$ printf '%b\n' $(printf "%s\n" "$QUERY_STRING" | sed 's/%/\\x/g')
	caf?

Or you can shell out to python, ruby, perl, etc... that have libraries
to do the decoding.

AFAIK that's not correct.  gmid was doing exactly that, and after
talking to Sean that raised some doubts about my CGI implementation (for
this and other details), I re-checked the RFC3875[0] and it effectively
requires QUERY_STRING to be url-encoded:

 - Writing new messages under topics
 - Client certificate based authorization
 - Updating expiring client certificates

Here it is running live on my Raspberry PI: gemini://bestiya.duckdns.org

I really appreciate any feedback.

On one hand, Gemini strictly mandates TLS ? ingraining it all the way down to very specific status codes, in the entrails of the protocol itself (the 6x series).

A MUST. 

On the other hand, Gemini agents are free to entirely ignore all of TLS, for all practical purposes ? and merrily move on with life.

What's the thinking here? S&M?

https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/gmni-discuss/%3CC9OP7IK9T9EP.15EOEOOS7QSB9%40taiga%3E

I've also updated my older TOFU recommendations article to reflect the
changes:

gemini://drewdevault.com/2020/09/21/Gemini-TOFU.gmi

In short, after listening to some feedback from the community on TOFU,
I'd like to make the following updated suggestions:

- Use long-lived certificates with the expiration set to the far future
- Client software should disregard notBefore/notAfter dates, and the
  common name as well. Requiring strong algorithms and other technical
  constraints is fine.

Any server software which wants to migrate to long-lived certificates
should let their current certificates expire and then automatically
issue a long-lived certificate to replace it when the time comes, rather
than switching immediately and causing your clients to flag your cert as
untrusted.

To re-state one of my previous recommendations, which I still figure is
a good idea: server software should handle certificate maintenance for
the user. Making the sysadmin generate certificates is cumbersome and
error prone, and because Gemini encourages TOFU and self-signed
certificates, we can remove that burden from server operators entirely
by generating certificates on-demand for the hosts we intend to service.

Aside: it might be a good idea to have a non-authoratitive TLS
best-practices document on gemini.circumlunar.space somewhere. I'd be
happy to draft up such a document if this is desirable.

Um... no offense intended, but if you're not on the list, then why are
you posting to the list?

Honest question.

No it's not. It happens every eighty something-ish days automatically.

For the forseeable future, Vger will continue to use LetsEncrypt. Easy
Peasy!

I hope that helps :)

It looks like you only wrote to the list, so I'm assuming he won't get 
your reply. Although I have to say that I shared your sentiment, that it 
seems a little unfair someone wants to not be part of the group but tell 
the group things. (ie, "you listen to me, I don't listen to you") That 
being said, it's just one of many e-mails on the list, so we can 
overlook it. The information might be useful to someone.

Yes I did only reply to the list. That was not a mistake. I'm glad you
noticed it :)

In response to the way you put it, "Someone not wanting to be part of a
 group, yet speaking to that group, might not be deserving the courtesy
of a response that ventures outside the confines of that group." Or
something to that affect. I think you get my implication there.

IOW, why would I show someone a courtesy they refuse to extend to me?

Good catch there Ben :)

It's quite common for someone to write to a mailing list without being
subscribed to it. Please use reply-all if you have more to add.

Suit yourself, but this is NOT easy!

Installing extra software, running an HTTP server (or TLS-ALPN) for LE
to query, running a cronjob (and keeping it running!)... there are a
dozen places for error here and it requires a lot of manual setup. Just
because you already did the work doesn't mean that it's easier!

In Gemini, we have the privilege of skipping all of this entirely and
having zero-configuration TLS. The server generates a certificate and it
just works. This is much easier.

True. Especially because no one verifies the resulting certificate at all. Easy-peasy indeed.

Actually, one could not bother at all as there is no chain of trust to speak of. Even easier.

What's the point? Honest question.

Gemini keeps on repeating 'tofu', 'tofu', 'tofu' ? like a talisman.

And each and every client understand it differently ? if at all.

To add insult to injury, it's purely optional. Optional! While TLS is mandatory!

It's fantastic that servers generates certificates on the fly ? trivial things first.

But then what? What's the operating model? Specifically. Consistently. Across the board.

If each client-server pairs have their own view on how to handle TLS ? then Gemini has nothing at all. 

Just a giant mess. With mandatory TLS pain for everyone.

I don't get it.

So be it.

Your reply threads nicely within the other messages. Sorry to be 
curious, did you import the message from somewhere or is it enough to 
manually specify a specific header?

Taking part in the list is well possible via the web archive, and 
subscription is not necessary to post, either, cf. 
https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini

Thanks to GMANE nntps might work with the list, too.

Trying out gmnisrv just yesterday, I was quite happy that it generated 
the cert files for me.

FWIW, I concur. Let's Encrypt is as streamlined and trivial as it gets.

The mailto link in the list archives (see the "From" header) includes an
in-reply-to header which is able to handle threading. But it's pretty
annoying to use this, which is why I asked to be Cc'd.

I don't know what to tell you two. There are zero steps with using an
auto-configured self-signed certificate. It requires no ongoing
maintenance. There are 5 or 6 steps involved in using Let's Encrypt, and
you have to top it up every 80 days.

You're simply wrong. It's not easier, and that's a fact.

No, I asked for a simple courtesey which is common on mailing lists
everywhere. It should be quite plain to any observer of this thread why
I felt it appropriate to bemoan this mailing list on IRC. Take a look in
the mirror, bud. This thread demonstrates quite neatly why I'm not
subscribed to the mailing list in the first place: because it's full of
such esteemed posters as yourself.

I don't mean to derail the focus of the conversation which is TOFU and TLS,
but as a newbie to this mailing list, I have to agree with the quoted
sentiment above.  It seems there's a bit of vitriol to an "outsider"
(Drew introduced me to gemini through his blog) who is trying to share his
recommendations.  I see nothing wrong with a non-subscriber sending
an email to the list. It's easy to archive/trash/filter out the sender
if you don't want to acknowledge their existence.

Honest answer for me.

I'm subscribed to this list. But I did read it from the
webarchive for quite some time.

I had been subscribed to some high volume lists times ago. BUT I
can't cope with that, so I consult the web archive of such lists
and chime in if I need it.


It is a matter of being nice to include someone, who asks for
being CC:ed. It's their choice, not mine.

What about hypothetical statements such as "I f*cking hate the mailing list"?

How would you rate such hypothetical? From naughty to nice ? to hypocritical?

  How about less trollish behavior with snarky commentary and more
constructive conversation?  Or is that too mature for you?  If it's too
mature, you can always forcibly unsubscribe you from the list (I know that
won't stop you completely from signing up again under a different email
address so don't bother saying that).

Just go ahead, Sean, unsubscribe and silence me. This will fit the spirit of this commune perfectly.

I usually refrain from getting involved in ML discussions. The reason is 
that I often don't have anything useful or good enough to contribute, 
and also I am aware the ML is very high-traffic and the last thing we 
need is more discussion.

I have been on this mailing list for a long time, before it was ever 
this crowded or active. I remember getting just one message from in the 
span of a month, maybe longer.

I'm not a big fan of moderation or exclusion. The first time I saw a 
message on the mailing list that I genuinely felt was bad and shouldn't 
have been sent (because it was too rude/direspectful or obnoxious), it 
was from Petite Abeille. I did not say anything, but it felt out of 
character for this list and this community. But hey, we are patient and 
tolerant, we can learn to get along, right?

Petite Abeille, if you are genuinely interested in Gemini and wants to 
be part of the community, I would not like to see you banned. However, I 
would implore you to reconsider how you interact on the ML. I can't help 
but feel you played some part in people being driven out of the ML, 
though of course not the only part.

As an additional matter to consider, in case some members of the mailing 
list are not aware (although most probably are), Petite Abeille is not a 
person's name, but it means "little bee" in French. I got the impression 
this name was chosen deliberately for trolling, to be anonymous and 
convey the message that this is a disruptive creature buzzing around and 
poking us with its stinger.

Also, some people might not be aware, but this mailing list was not 
supposed to allow Gmail addresses, but a special exception was made for 
people interested in Gemini to be allowed to use it. It was thought this 
is for the benefit of the community. However, perhaps we've also 
unwittingly opened up the list to abuse by throw-away e-mail accounts?

Just some things to consider.

Ben

Okay, Point of correction here. Drew, I know you to be an otherwise
upstanding person who prides himself in his capacity to provide service
to the community for a greater good.

But I stated what I stated, and that is not what I stated. Please do not
put words in my mouth - especially since I never said, *easier*.

I never implied that it was not also easy to use self-signed certs (and
most servers I'm aware of will perform this automatically if you don't
provide a certificate yourself).

What I said is that it is easy (rather, Easy Peasy, I think) to use
LetsEncrypt to handle all of that automatically.

Trying to imply that I said something I NEVER said, which implies that I
meant something else, is beneath you. Please refrain from such behavior
in the future where it concerns me - a single, individual person.

I'm not angry with you, I'll just chalk this up to you losing context
because you are  as passionate about Gemini space as many of us others
are that have been involved with the project since the very beginning. I
don't recall seeing any participation from you prior to about six months
ago. Again, that's okay, and I think your intentions are grand - don't
put words in my mouth though.

Mailing lists are a multiplayer venue. This thread has two people,
yourself one of them, who have expressed that Let's Encrypt is easy.
You are not the person who said it was "easier" (emphasis on the "er"),
and the person I directly replied to in the thread with my comments was
someone who did. I suggest you review the archives if you're not
receiving all of the emails in the thread.

It's evident that you only have half of the conversation, which is not
my fault. I will note that you still refuse the basic courtesy of
Cc'ing me on your replies. Not sure what moral high ground you seem to
perceive yourself as coming from here.

Wow, Three years of French at UCSD and I didn't make that connection. I
filtered that user a long time ago when it became apparent that I didn't
find anything  constructive coming from the account, for me personally.
I typically do that with serial Top-Posters too, I find that even more
annoying and detest having to continually scroll up/down/up/down just to
figure out what's being conveyed.

I didn't realize that DEAs were permitted now. I still block them from
purchasing many services from me - Google is the great facilitator of
legitimized Spam.

Sean's deployment of tracking issues via Gitlab was a great idea to
avoid noise while working, and effectively creates a WG (working group)
that can focus on the matters at hand.

Personally, I would have probably chosen tildegit, since many of the
major contributors are homed in that community, or perhaps Codeberg, or
even sr.ht (Yeah pls don't flame me for that - it's a good service), but
Gitlab works and isn't GitHub so that's good.

Thanks for that info Ben.

The only issue with tildegit is that it's restricted to people that are
in tildes.  You can request an account (real people are the ones
validating requests after all) but many people wouldn't want to sign up
for a new service just to work on the Gemini spec.  For instance, I
don't have a gitlab account and therefore am not participating in those
discussions because why would I make a whole new account for literally
one thing.  I do have a tildegit account which would make it better for
me, but then you'd be putting lots of other people in my situation and
cutting a lot of valuable contributors out.  And yeah, github is a no-go
for obvious reasons.

I would vote for sourcehut because you don't need a sourcehut account to
participate (same with this ML), while still keeping the discussion
separate from this list, which, IMO, should be announcements of
interesting software and new capsules and things like that, plus formal
spec announcements.


Oh yeah, learning to block users in your email server or email client is
a valuable skill, particularly on this list unfortunately.

Actually, the only handle who used "easier" in  this entire thread is sir at cmpwn.com. SIR!

On second reading... I take this back! :o)

But this was unrelated to Let's Encrypt vs. whatnot per se. Rather the larger question of TOFU. Pointless.

That was a fair enough request. Yes, the party to which you refer is an
account that I filtered to /dev/null a long time ago. My bad. It
appeared as if you were referring to me.

You'll note I also cc'd you on this. It's my practice to set my MUAs to
only "reply list", since that's where I'm conversing. I can't promise
anything in the future, but I'll try, and a friendly reminder with each
of your posts will help :)

On another note, I would appreciate it if you would take a moment to
ensure that your webproxy agent stays off my lawn at *.vger.cloud. I
have no qualms about other types of agents, I just personally believe
that people should use native Gemini and Gopher protocol clients (which
includes browser plugins such as dillo-gemini, qute-gemini, OverbiteNX,
and SSH kiosks) to browse Gemini and Gopher space.

My reasons are my own, and I do not purport to speak on behalf of anyone
else who manages Gemini services.

Thank you.

Reply all is a safe bet on all mailing lists, I recommend using it by
default to make sure you include everyone in the thread.

My proxy's IP address is 173.195.146.137, I leave the rest up to you.
It's my proxy's responsibility to dutifully perform the requests the
user asks of it, and it's your responsibility to curtail whatever kinds
of traffic you don't want to access your server. I do not support
discrimination against user agents, because that's discrimination
against users.*

For what it's worth, my proxy only serves my domain and serves external
content only if the user follows links from my domain to a third party.
It's not useful as a general purpose web portal to geminispace.

  against /badly behaved/ user agents is a different matter than
  discrimination against well-behaved user agents on the basis that
  you don't like them.

A trollish name could be "little wasp". Bees are industrious and
useful insects (honey, pollination). The wasp sting is also more
frequent and more painful than bee sting.  ...so, "Petite Abeille"
sounds more positive to me :-)

Not really, no. Mostly pests control. Go figure.

That said, I still don't get the TOFU usage model in the context of Gemini... not that I necessarily need to understand it to have a good night sleep, but still... out of curiosity...

In ssh, I know the host, therefore I trust the key. Plus, this happens only every blue moon. No brainer.

Not so in the wild-wild Gemini space.

Infinite number of esoteric, fly-by-night operators.

All harmless for sure, but still.

What's the trust model, if any?

Or is it more like Trust-And-Pray (TAP)?

In which case, why bother? Just ignore all certificates and be merry.

This is what a Little Bee impersonator had to say on GitLab:

Trust on first use (TOFU) is akin to unprotected intercourse: you must trust your partner to keep Gonorrhea at bay.

No trust, no use.

https://gitlab.com/gemini-specification/protocol/-/issues/5#note_522445814

It was not well received, needless to say. 

That much is clear.

  It wasn't my idea, but a suggestion from Stephane Bortzmeyer, who also
suggested gitlab.  I went ahead and created an account (just for this) and
set up the issue tracker.

Subject: The protection offered by TLS in a TOFU scheme
Message-ID: <CAJScK0JsGixoVG_DAf+JHvL7763zyARyJ1VudEE=oeFcbYO9gQ@mail.gmail.com>

There's been some questions on the mailing list about what sort of
protection a TOFU scheme in certificates offers. I've written about
this on my gemlog a couple of times, and several people have told me
that the posts are a good introduction to the subject. Therefore I
feel confident about posting links here :)

The first one is a short and somewhat sloppy introduction to
certificate security in general. The second is a more thorough guide
to TOFU as a validation scheme.

In general, TLS without any validation at all offers no significant
protection. However (and this is worth noting) it does protect data in
transit from dragnet surveillance. A simple sniff of network traffic
will not reveal the paths you visit on a server, or the query strings
you send. That's always something. Any sort of validation at all
offers more security on top of that. TOFU is not perfect, but it's a
lot better than no validation.

Hi geminauts,

Today i would like to announce the first true release of MastoGem.

As I announced before you can view the last toots from a Mastodon 
profile, but you can also search for a tag, view a thread and view the 
mentions and the tag of a toot.

I have made a docker image to make the deployment easier and if you want 
help to deploy your own instance of MastoGem I can help you.

The software works fine and respect Gemini specs (I hope).

All the information about MastoGem is now here :

Thank you for reaching out, and taking the time to verbalize your usage assumptions.

Onwards to your specific points:


? PROTECT DATA IN TRANSIT FROM DRAGNET SURVEILLANCE

Yes, somewhat ? ignoring larger issues such as deeper network traffic analyzes. But yes, the transmission is somewhat encrypted, at a bare minimum.

Courtesy of TLS though, the aptly named Transport Layer Security. Nothing to do with TOFU per se. 

The expedient of ignoring certificates altogether would achieve the same effect.

Also, the mere existence of certificates and usage of TLS may compromise privacy ? for a given value of "privacy".

TLS Fingerprint
https://tlsfingerprint.io

The use of TLS in Censorship Circumvention
https://tlsfingerprint.io/static/frolov2019.pdf

Clients could leak unwelcome informations.
Servers could generate unique certificates for tracking purpose. 
The possibilities for abuse are endless, as always.


? TOFU IS NOT PERFECT, BUT IT'S A LOT BETTER THAN NO VALIDATION

The same assertion is made by the current specification, toward the end of 4.2 Server certificate validation:

"This model is by no means perfect, but it is not awful and is vastly superior to just accepting self-signed certificates unconditionally."

Saying so doesn't make it so.

My personal point of contention is that I do not buy that argument at all: it seems to be more wishful thinking than actual reality.

The operative word in "Trust on first use" is /trust/.

Where does the trust come from?

Quoting Wikipedia:

"The single largest strength of any TOFU-style model is that a human being must initially validate every interaction."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_on_first_use#Model_strengths_and_weaknesses

How is this meant to happen in Gemini space? How does this happen in your operating model? How do you trust or not a given certificate?

Furthermore:

"The largest weakness of TOFU that requires manual verification is its inability to scale for large groups or computer networks."

How do you scale it, in your operating model?

The usage pattern for Gemini is quite different from SSH. How does SSH usage assumptions translates to Gemini? That's the crux of the question.

Until we develop a coherent operating model for TOFU in the context of Gemini, this is all hocus-pocus and cargo cult.

These are my personal opinions only. I speak for not other bees, but myself :)

Thanks for sharing though, but this fails short, in my view, of a coherent operational model.

YMMV as always.

Yes. Note that I don't -- for example -- claim that it protects us
from meta data or tracking. As you say, there are endless options for
abuse. Most of those apply to the CA cert validation scheme too, of
course. Any data we send or receive is a data point that can be
harvested at some point and form along the way, and the more data
points an adversary has the more it can analyse and infer.

You are absolutely right. As I wrote in my second gemlog post:

"Trust On First Use basically means that if I can't verify the
identity of the server I connect to, I can at least make sure to check
that it's the same server on any subsequent connections. In and of
itself this is not a terrible scheme. As mentioned in the spec no
certificate chain needs to be sent, for example. This can almost half
the amount of data sent on in a single request, as gemtext documents
are typically quite small. We also protect ourselves from Man in the
Middle Attacks on all connections except - notably - the first.

The downsides are equally obvious. First of all we can't automatically
validate the server on our first connection. Neither can we really on
subsequent connections; we can only tell if it's still the same host."

In a CA scheme we trust the CAs. Despite the CA system having its own
set of flaws (did you know that a company Example Inc can be
incorporated in two different states in the US by entirely different
people, and thus both buy legitimate certificates for the same
domains, as the CAs will assume that it's the same corporate entity?).

Basically, whichever scheme we choose will have its own flaws and
merits. It's very much a matter of which flaws you find to be most
dangerous or abhorrent.

For my own sake I very much liked both your implementation of the
mercury protocol and Solderpunk's speculative post about it. There's
something alluringly simple about proclaiming that "F it, TLS is just
security theatre anyway!" and skipping it altogether. And it wouldn't
be entirely wrong; there are some huge and obvious problems with it,
as we've seen. I twitch nervously whenever sending login credentials
over an unencrypted connection, though, knowing that it'll be stored
in plain text in someone's log somewhere along the way.

I definitely think that TOFU solves some problems. Not all, but some.
And somewhere we have to decide which problems we want to solve and
which ones we're willing to accept. Gemini is not a great protocol if
you're in need of strong privacy.

Indeed. Arguably, no protocols are :)

It's my opinion that the easiest course of action is to ignore the TOFU problematic altogether ?  and blindly use TLS for transmission security only. 

TOFU doesn't seem to be a good operational fit for Gemini.

Developing  a whole new trust model to support it is beyond the scope of the Gemini protocol ? in my view.

The easiest win would be to stick to just plain TLS ? and call it a day.

An absolutely valid opinion. Just accept any cert and go. Any client
developer out there can already do that, of course (and any automated
clients have to, in the current state of affairs).

Another option is to stick with CAs, which all(?) TLS libraries do by
default. Also a valid opinion.

I personally like TOFU, but it's proven to be very very hard to
communicate to implementers and server operators what TOFU means for
them.

Basically, in my opinion, all these three options have merits and
flaws and I'd be okay with any of them as the final choice.

That makes perfect sense for TOFU. If for whatever reason you need to
renew a certificate (e.g. to use stronger encryption) you can just swap
it out. The clients will (hopefully) learn of the change and can choose
whether to trust the new certificate.

Without a chain of trust, and ignoring notBefore/notAfter, there's no
point in waiting.

The client (according to the procedure you describe in your article)
will find the old cert in known_hosts in step 2., see that the served
certificate differs and consider the new certificate UNTRUSTED. That is
true regardless of whether you immediately replace the certificate or
wait until the old one has expired, unless the client *doen't* ignore
notBefore/notAfter and uses those dates to vacuum known_hosts to remove
expired certificates automatically (which is impossible given the store
format you currently recommend).

The procedure you describe does not provide for any other way to roll
out new certificates than for the new one to be UNTRUSTED, nor do I
think clients are able to provide this in general outside the use of
certificate authorities or validity date based vacuuming of known_hosts.

That's really how it has to be for TOFU: whenever a new certificate is
used, a new trust has to be established. *Any* certificate that
you haven't used is untrusted.

IMO, UNKNOWN is really the same thing as UNTRUSTED. There is no
UNKNOWN state; either I've asserted my trust in the certificate or I
haven't. UNKNOWN and UNTRUSTED are just different cases of untrusted
certificates, with latter giving you an additional piece of
information: that you have already trusted a different certificate for
the given host. I think it's better for clients if they are treated as
such.

In my client, the user gets a choice whenever they encounter a new
certificate. If the trust store happens to contain a different
certificate for the host, that information will be displayed to the
user as well, so that they can use it as a basis for the decision
whether to trust the new certificate. Manually editing known_hosts is
just that, "with extra steps".

Agreed. I think your article is a good starting point, but consider my

"Warning fatigue has pushed many messaging applications to remove blocking warnings to prevent users from reverting to less secure applications that do not feature end-to-end encryption in the first place."

This doesn't scale. Could as well accept everything. Or ignore everything. Same effect.

Subject: Enhancing TOFU
Message-ID: <34M5ARFUSFXM4.2JH6LX3034N1P@nothien.uber.space>

Hi!

I think that people find TOFU controversial because it removes the
ability for clients to verify the authenticity of servers they've never
connected to before and it prevents servers from ever being able to
change certificates.  I think that both of these issues are solvable
while keeping with the spirit of Gemini.

xq (on IRC) proposed the concept of 'distributed trust' lists, which are
simply lists associating domains with public keys (i.e. their hashes).
Gemini servers and clients can then distribute and verify trust lists,
and can even merge trust lists from different sources together.  This
neatly solves the first problem, by allowing clients to check their
trust lists to determine the public key of a server and so to
authenticate them even in the first connection.

Here's xq's post about their idea:
=> gemini://random-projects.net/blog/2021-03-03-distributed-trust.gemini

I propose an extension to this, which allows servers to announce their
intention (in a verifiable way) to change certificates in the near
future.  Essentially, servers now provide (over Gemini) a '/.pubkey' URL
where they serve the hash of the public key they will use in the near
future (which may be the same as the public key they use right now).
Clients can periodically request '/.pubkey' to check if the server
intends to change their pubkey soon.  In later connections, the server
will either use the current pubkey or the previously-announced future
pubkey - if clients see the latter being used, they know that the server
has transitioned to using this future pubkey and so can drop the
previous pubkey.  This provides a safe method for verifying server
certificates, even when they are rotated.

There are a few more details, which you can read about on my blog post:
=> gemini://gemini.ctrl-c.club/~aravk/blog/2021-03-04-distributed-trust.gmi

The exact format used and various smaller details can be tweaked as we
see fit, but I'm looking for thoughts on the general concept.  I know
that there are some voices for permanently using a single certificate,
but I personally prefer rotating certs and I think that the perma-cert
people don't lose out at all in this.

Any (constructive) feedback is appreciated.

What is the motivation for using it? In a TOFU system the only real

The format I previously recommended stored the expiration date, and
other clients might as well. Waiting to rotate is the most conservative
choice which maximizes your compatibility with the most clients
regardless of their adherence to these best practices.

I think your criticism only applies in a transitive sense, while the
community is moving from one procedure to another, and should have
little influence on any kind of proposed standard or guidelines.

Thank you for sharing. Appreciating the engagement.

Not sure how to put it "constructively", but this looks... unfinished.

But ok, let's suspend disbelieve for a second, and assume you have solved the decentralized trust conundrum on your own ? minus blocks, minus chains, plus something. 

First off, congrats! :)

This is a major achievement - a breakthrough in computer science, as understood by the  security community at large.

Question: are you going to publish a proper white paper on it ? and have it peer reviewed?

By "peer", I don't means some pesky insects on some god forsaken corner of the interweb. More like proper scrutiny. Probing. By actual security experts.

Sorry to rain on your parade, but truly, I cannot muster anything supportive to say at all. Apologies. Nothing personal.

Meanwhile, perhaps I could interest you in keybase:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keybase

Specifically, their take on identity proofs.

Perhaps of interest.

I disagree with any feature which involves the client periodically
requesting a specific file from the server, for reasons we should
probably not re-hash.

Why use a technical solution when a social solution would be suitable? A
much easier way is to simply announce the upcoming cert change in your
gemlog.

Because of the scale of the network.

Such "social" approach works in the small, but doesn't scale.

It simply moves the problem around: now the burden of proof is on the user to check some sort of "announcements" and act on it meaningfully. Each and every single time.

In my personal experience, this will never fly.

YMMV for sure.

The intention is not for ordinary clients to have to do this (unless
they want to), but for servers distributing these trust lists to perform
this verification/update.

I appreciate what was constructive about your response, but this last 
part presents a practical problem. When I wrote to you I asked you to 
make a sincere effort to take the mailing list more seriously. "feel 
free to ban me" comes across as a negative response. So if I read you

Message-ID: <C9D76F5A-CDE8-4E63-A4C7-2A8564583358@gmail.com>

Food for thoughts...

PREAMBLE
This is entirely unrelated to either TLS, or TOFU, or the Gemini protocol per se.  Just a possible usage convention, agreed between user-agents and participating services.


INTRODUCTION
Keybase provides a well thought off platform for identity proof, with easy integration, among other things:

Proof Integration
https://book.keybase.io/guides/proof-integration-guide

Plus a full-fledged toolkit:

Command Line
https://book.keybase.io/guides/command-line

And *nix friendly:
Linux
https://book.keybase.io/guides/linux

And open source:
https://github.com/keybase

Thanks Keybase for sharing!


USAGE

In a nutshell, Gemini services could piggyback on Keybase to prove their identity and sign all text/gemini they emit.

User-agents could in turn validate such signed text/gemini and visually indicate the outcome (exact details skipped for brevity).

That's all. 

Nothing much to it actually. All the hard work has already been done by Keybase & friends :) 


P.S.

There is also Keybase's saltpack & sigchain:

So.... This only works with Mastodon, and Not ActivityPub servers in the
Fediverse such as Pleroma, Epicyon, Jejune, Misskey, PeerTube, Pixelfed,
Friendica, etc.?

Or do you know  if it works with some of them?

I ask because I finally manged to retire my Mastodon servers. It took
over a year to kick everyone off of them gracefully lol. I don't care an
awful lot for Mastodon (Yet do maintain a couple of accounts on a couple
of Mastodon servers). The whole premise of Twitter's original 160 chars
(Now Mastodon's default 500 char limit) just doesn't work for me and all
of the clients splitting long posts across several different 'toots'
makes it even worse.

Other ActivityPub servers enable actual Tuts, HowTos, Blogs and
Articles, etc., something Mastodon is not well suited, nor intended for.
As such, if one doesn't mind that resources it requires it's fine.

But a tool such as yours sounds awesome if it supports ActivityPub
servers in General, especially Epicyon, Misskey, and Pleroma. The others
would be a huge bonus, and fantastic news, but to me, Mastodon alone
really isn't the niche platform I'm looking to support in .gmi files.

Great work though, and your demo looks pretty awesome?

If it doesn't support Fediverse ActivityPub in general, or at least some
of the one's I've mentioned above, and you're not adverse to working
toward bringing that support, I can open an issue on your Gitea server
is you like and work diligently with you to bring such functionality :)

Again, I think MastoGem is a fantastic accomplishment!

Kindest regards,

um... I think I spoke a little too soon. Just searching on a tag on the
prod server pulled in several posts of mine from a Pleroma server,
faster, and more efficiently than any search on a Mastodon or Pleroma
server ever would. I'm extremely, thoroughly impressed. This is really
good shit!

Example: gemini://mastogem.picasoft.net/tag?vger

I'mma sold on Mastogem already :) What a great way to author Gemlogs!

And the best part is, as a proxy, it pulls from HTTP space *into* Gemini
space, and not the other way around, which strips bloat and presents the
content itself as text/gemini.

Yah, this is fricken' awesome!

Glancing at the code, it uses the mastodon API.  So it uses mastodon as
a "backend" (otherwise they'd have to write a full activitypub backend
from scratch, which is unreasonable to expect), but you can see all
activitypub content just like you could see it on mastodon.

Yes, this is a real problem. Even with a long-lived certificate you will 
need to change it eventually to keep up with developments in 
cryptography.

But I think we can solve this neatly by using certificate chains. If you 
have a certificate which is trusted by many users and want to rotate to 
a new certificate, sign the new certificate with the old one (treating 
it as a CA) and have your server present the old certificate and the new 
one as a chain. Then users will be able to see that they should carry 
over their trust in the old certificate to the new one.

Clients should either warn the user about the change while providing 
enough information that the user can see what has happened, or could 
optionally automatically transfer trust to a cert signed by a previously 
trusted cert for the same domain (being careful about wildcards!).

Some clients already provide enough information, i.e. fingerprints for 
the old trusted cert and all certs in the new chain. But I see that not 
all do.

I tested the signing process, and it seems straightforward. Here's what 
I did, but please don't slavishly copy this; this is the result of a few 
minutes with man openssl-x509, and I may be missing some important steps 
(e.g. I ignored serial numbers, which I *think* makes sense, but maybe 
I'm missing something):
```
gemcert -server mydomain
openssl x509 -CA old.crt -CAkey old.key -in mydomain.crt -out signed.crt
cat signed.crt old.crt > chain.crt
```
Now give chain.crt and mydomain.key to your server.
Here old.crt was also generated by gemcert.

Am I missing something, or does this make sense?

It was originally designed to be a mirror of a Mastodon account so to make things easier I only use the Mastodon API. So it only works with Mastodon content.
We can view some content from other services like PeerTube (an example here : gemini://mastogem.picasoft.net/profile/374759) if the instance is federated with the Mastodon instance used for MastoGem but it is only the content shown in Mastodon (not the video or the blog post).

I will not have a lot of time to spend in this functionality until July but it is a great idea.

Thank you very much for this feedback

Hi All,

I'm rather new to this project and I'd like to spread the word, but I feel
that there's a bit of a naming collision when trying to discuss it with the
outside world. Go had a similar issue, but then a convention developed with
the term golang so that people could find things about it instead of the
ancient board game.

What's the term that you use to describe this project and community with
the outside world? I'd like to try to be consistent with whatever you've
come up with already.

Thanks,
Chris

I think for the most part people say Gemini protocol if they need to
disambiguate the protocol from the rocket from the Zodiac sign.

I don't think there's a name collision there unless there's another Gemini
protocol out there somewhere, but if there is we appear to have kicked its ass
because a Google search for Gemini protocol brings me to all the right stuff
(which feels like a miracle -- this project has come so far in these two short
years) which still isn't the case when you're looking for Go documentation, so
I think we're probably fine.

best,

Heya geminauts!

In the last days, i've written a new streaming gemini text parser:

gemini://random-projects.net/blog/2021-03-05-gemtext-parser.gemini

https://github.com/MasterQ32/zig-gemtext

The parser is written in Zig, but exposes both a C and Zig API. If you
want to start a new project that processes gemini text, you can use this
library :)

Gemreader is a FOSS Gemini service which provides a hosted feed reading
experience for Geminispace. I've made an instance available to the
public here, where you can try it out:

gemini://feeds.drewdevault.com

A client certificate is required.

Gemreader supports fetching feeds both from Gemini and from the web (via

the web are converted from HTML to Gemtext automatically for comfortable
reading.

The source code is here:

This is quite a significant peeve of mine.  Not so much what
individuals do, but rather that certain "support" products, or whatever
ignore everything below a certain point (if there's any indication that
the reply is at the bottom).  

I get why *people* are doing top posting.  I don't have a huge problem
with that.  What I do have a problem with, is when I spend time
responding meaningfully, and get a response, "your email came with no
content"...  

It's possible it did, I'm almost certain the *reason* it did, is
because you stripped anything from the first indication of a "quote"
section.

Subject: [ANNOUNCE] [META] Mailing List Moderation Update
Message-ID: <87sg58tfgx.fsf@cassilda.carcosa.net>

Hello! It's your friendly neighborhood list owner here, with some
updates about how we are handling list moderation. There have been a lot
of people complaining about the volume of posts on the list and the low
quality of discussions, and I'm going to do some things to help with
that.

# Topics

A reminder! This list has topics. You are *strongly* encouraged to go to
your user options page at https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini
and select the topics you wish to subscribe to, and tick the box saying
you do *not* want to see messages with no topic. This will help cut down
on the volume of messages you see, and keep them relevant to your
interests.

You should also always use a topic when posting a new thread. As a
reminder, the topics are [announce], [users], [tech], and [spec]. The
intended content for each is as follows:

[announce]: Official and important announcements about the project of
wide interest. Please don't post to this topic if you are not a list
admin!

[users]: Discussion relevant to "end users" of Gemini, e.g. announcement
of new capsules and services (e.g. search), hosting providers, clients,
etc. General Gemini discussion and advocacy. Excessively technical
discussion discouraged.

[tech]: Technical discussion of Gemini as currently specced, e.g.
questions about client/server implementation, application development,
announcement of new libraries and other developer-focussed software.

[spec]: Discussion about finalising the protocol specification, and
formal standardisation efforts. You should *not* subscribe to [spec]
unless you really do intend to engage productively in the finalization
process of the specification.

Topics can be included, with the brackets, either in the subject line,
or anywhere in the first five lines of the message.

# User Moderation

When I get complaints about a particular user lowering the quality of
discussion on the list, I may, at my discretion, set the "moderated"
flag on them, which means I have to manually choose whether to approve
or reject their message. My moderation decisions will be capricious and
arbitrary, and mostly based on whether I feel that particular message is
constructed.

If someone is actually being abusive or making personal attacks or
harassing someone on the list, I will unsubscribe them, but you're also
encouraged to killfile them.

# Non-subscriber Posting

Currently, non-subscriber posts are held for moderation. I've been
approving basically everything that is on-topic and not spam. This is
going to change. Now, non-subscriber postings will only be approved:

1. If they are announcements in [users] or [tech]. That is,
   announcements of new capsules, new services, or new software.
2. If they are an on-topic, closed-ended question for group members,
   especially in [tech].

Non-subscriber replies in existing threads *will not be approved*. If
you want to participate in discussion, you should subscribe to the
mailing list. If it is too noisy for you, limit your subscription to the
topics you want, and don't allow messages without a topic. Consider
changing your subscription to a daily digest if it's still too much and
you can't set up appropriate mail filtering.

# Conclusion

I think that's about it. If there are any questions or complaints,
please mail me directly (off-list). If we need to create a separate
gemini-announce list, that's possible too.

Happy hacking!

Currently, the Gemini specification requires client certificates be
limited to the URL hostname and path for which they were requested. My
Gemini client automatically generates certificates for the user, and
this requirement makes it much more complicated to store and load
certificates. For simplicity's sake, I propose that client certificates
only be limited to the hostname for which they were requested.

Also, if I understood right, [ANN] is not technically a topic according

[ANN] has been rather popular on the list.

Hello!

I'm working on a C++ server library, mousygem. It's not a standalone server but rather a library for writing servers. It handes sockets, (most) OpenSSL functions, receiving/parsing URIs, and formatting/sending responses to clients.

I've just started on it about a couple days ago, but I think it's in a state where I can show it off a little bit.?You can write a basic server that echos "Hello world" to the client in 31 lines of code or less with this.

https://github.com/SnowyMouse/mousygem

I'm still very new to working with OpenSSL's C API, so this has been quite a journey so far! I've also still got a lot of work to do with this, especially in regards to better handling client certificates, but I'm probably going to start using it for my blog and seeing how well that goes.

Many thanks,
Snowy

Subject: [TECH] Testing and reviews for HtmGem, Php program to view Gemini
 through HTTP
Message-ID: <20210307001640.23b3da77@chris-nux>

Hi all,

My projects need testing and reviews. Its purpose is to enable serving
Gemtext through an HTTP server. Copied on a Php webserver, it would
serve Gemini pages by converting them on-the-fly to HTML.

https://git.sr.ht/~sbgodin/htmgem

Thanks for any comment and point of view :-)

That's correct. People should be using [announce]. I'll try to craft a
regex that will match them both and put them both in the announce
category, but I'm not 100% sure what flavor of regex syntax Mailman
uses.

Wouldn't this cause problems with multi-user capsules?  e.g. as a user,
if I used a certificate for gemini://example.com/~user1/cgi/foo I may
don't want that same certificate to be sent to
gemini://example.com/~user2/cgi/bar.

Maybe limiting them to a path AND all the descendant paths?  So that
/~user1/cgi/foo and /~user1/cgi/foo/bar are using the same cert by
default?

Iirc this is the current recommendation, and I agree with your argument about multiuser hosts.

You mean [users]? As I understand it, [announce] is for "official"
announcements that nearly everyone on the list would probably want to know.

Message-ID: <20210307120010.GA28405@librem13.home>

Hi all,

A new version of qute-gemini is available here:
https://git.sr.ht/~sotirisp/qute-gemini

qute-gemini is a qutebrowser userscript that allows browsing Geminispace from within qutebrowser. This version fixes several issues but is still not nearly as good as a proper Gemini client. See the known issues section for details but the gist of it is that qutebrowser userscripts aren't allowed to do many things. It should be good enough for visiting the occasional Gemini link in an HTML document though.

Best,
Sotiris

Great to see some new content in the geminiverse

You could consider presenting the links page in the form of a gemini 
feed - it is a quite clean format and you can still have embedded 
headings and the like to provide an overall structure. It would also 
mean you don't need a heading and a link for each entry

for example to change

### Using AWS X-Ray with a TypeScript Lambda

=> /2021/03/03/using-xray-with-a-typescript-lambda

to the simpler format:

=> /2021/03/03/using-xray-with-a-typescript-lambda 2021-03-03 - Using 
AWS X-Ray with a TypeScript Lambda

here is the companion specification:

gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/companion/subscription.gmi

It will assist with anyone who wants to subscribe to your page as a feed.

Thank you for sending this out. I'll try to follow the established
etiquette. A couple of questions.

Is this information posted somewhere in Gemini Space so that I can refer to
it later on?

Can these guidelines be sent to anyone subscribing to the list when they
first subscribe? I just recently subscribed and I wasn't aware of any of
this.

Cheers,
Chris

Multi-user capsules would still work. The server would recognize which
user you are by your certificate.

Instead of limiting the certificate to certain paths, clients should
allow the user to create multiple certificates per host and switch
between them easily.

No.  The server will execute the CGI scrips happily passing any
certificates you provide.  In multi-user capsules, ex.com/~user1 and
ex.com/~user2 are like completely different hosts in this regard.

Yes, I meant [users]. Please forgive my absent-mindedness.

I should be able to set that up, but it won't be immediately.

I have really enjoyed the Gemini community. Inspired by projects like Gneto, I wanted to write a Gemini to HTTP proxy in Clojure. My hope is to make it easy to use and highly customizable. Here it is:

Here is a demo! My personal capsule is available over HTTPS with Rebound:

And Drew deVault who said that using Let's Encrypt was too complicated
:-) Anything that requires such operations does not seem to fit with
the principles of Gemini. (And I speak from experience managing DNSSEC
key rollovers.)

Also, this proposal does not address unplanned emergency changes (such
as one triggered by a compromise of the private key). They are one of
the biggest problems with TOFU.

Gemini already has one way to announce this intention. To quote the
spec, "If the certificate is not the one previously received, BUT THE
PREVIOUS CERTIFICATE'S EXPIRY DATE HAS NOT PASSED, the user is shown a
warning". So, to announce your intention to change the certificate,
just say so in the expiration date (notAfter field).

Agunua <gemini://gemini.bortzmeyer.org/software/agunua/> does it in a
more liberal way, accepting a change if there is less than 10 % of the
former certificate life remaining:

# We accept a slack of 10 % of the certificate lifetime, or 7 days, whatever is smaller.
slack = old_lifetime/10
if datetime.timedelta(days=7) < old_lifetime/10:
    slack = datetime.timedelta(days=7)
if self.keystring != old_key:
    if datetime.datetime.utcnow() >= (old_expiration - slack):
          pass # OK, it is expired or soon to be
    else:
          error = "Former public key at %s was %s, new one is %s. ...

In other words broadcast to potential attackers when the best time to
do a MitMA is :)

If clients silently accept new certificates this gets even worse,
because it opens a window where the attack can happen without anyone
knowing.

A certificate that's valid for 90 days, ending 9 days from now, can
silently be replace by another certificate with the same
not-valid-before and not-valid-after, allowing the attacker 9 days of
unnoticed operation.

I think we've pretty much laid out all the pros and cons of TOFU as a
validation scheme. I personally believe there is very little benefit
to trying to make it more secure, compared to the added complexity.

We need to clarify the spec around what TOFU means for clients and
servers, and that includes removing advice like "check
not-valid-before, hostname, and not-valid-after" and that certificates
should be rotated.

Or we need to decide to not use TOFU. I'm not going to reiterate the
alternatives I see, but suffice to say that I think this is an issue
of "decide which set of pros and cons to accept".

Cheers,
ew0k

I've promoted Gemini to some blind people by adding the Elaho client to the
Applevis app directory:

https://www.applevis.com/apps/ios/utilities/elaho

And I plan on talking about it more on Twitter, where most blind people
are, and other places. I think Gemini can be a great, simple, content-rich
place for blind people.

I have written up how clients and servers can support out-of-band pubkey
verification to add a higher level of trust where needed. My opinion is
that for 99% of connections made by most clients, TOFU provides sufficient
security. For those situations where TOFU is judged by the user to be
insufficiently secure, clients can (sic) offer a variety of different
ways to support easy out-of-band verification.

I call this approach "Trust, but Verify (where appropriate)."

In a nutshell, 3 security levels would be offered and displayed by a
client following this, the first 2 of which are already part of TOFU:

- red: untrusted, mostly if certificate mismatch is encountered
- yellow: trusted, likely the large majority of all connections,
          here the host cert matches the known host of the same name
- green: verified - cert matches known host, plus the client has
         matched the cert with an out-of-band digest of the cert,
         confirming the identity of the server. This would be useful
         for connections involving sensitive information.

The details should be left to the client, with some technically simple
examples provided (entering/pasting pubkey hash, random art like
'ssh-keygen -lv'). A variety of technically more complicated ways to
confirm the pubkey like TLSA, DANE, TXT records could fall into this
approach, too, but I think it could be left up to the client and servers
what ways to offer to support the verification.

Subject: Gemini privacy
Message-ID: <CAOH6EB_aGuJqd7gqFk9RT0sjFogouqM0tEPzn6Harv4bZVDvOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Privacy appears to be essential for Gemini users. A lot of discussions
revolve around TLS, TOFU and how to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM)
attacks.

There may be other attacks simpler to set up. Let's take an example:

Alice visits Bob's gemini capsule. Nathan is a young NSA analyst
assigned to this emerging Gemini thing. We assume Nathan has access to
the tcp stream between Alice and Bob.  The stream is TLS-encrypted
(with the most recent TLS crypto).  What can Nathan do?

Nathan quickly builds a gemini spider/indexer program and starts
collecting for all Gemini sites the accessible files as any user could
do. On whether Nathan's spider respects robots.txt, your guess is as
good as mine.

Nathan finds that Bob's capsule contains 3 files (this is just an
example!) which are 1KB, 5KB and 100KB large.

Now Nathan looks at Alice's encrypted traffic with Bob's server. Just
looking at the response sizes, Nathan knows what file(s) Alice has
accessed and their content (collected during the indexing phase).  No
crypto, no MITM involved.

Of course, with lots of files in Bob's capsule,  the matching is less
perfect, but it still leaks lots of information regarding what Alice
read.

This is easier for Gemini than for https because Gemini documents are
precisely simpler. No keep-alive (or maybe I missed some recent Gemini
development?), each file is loaded in its own request-response
transaction.

What countermeasures could we propose? I can think of a few more or
less practical approaches::

1. make sure the same file is never served with the same size - add
random white space at the end of gmi / txt / html files, add random
comments to pics, zip files, etc.

2. or add lots of "decoy" files (with all sorts of sizes) to your
capsule. It will make life more difficult for the attackers, ... but
also for the legit indexers.

3.  Adopt a "twitter-like" approach: serve only fixed-size content.
Serve only 8 KB gmi pages and 32KB pics (didn't Solderpunk have an
experiment with fixed size pics?)

Do you consider that this type of attack is far-fetched?  To set them
up, an access to the network is required (to log Alice transactions) -
so typically an ISP (or maybe a 3-letter agency :-) - maybe also
corporate IT, for a targeted  attack against an employee.

Or do you think the Gemini/TLS privacy expectations should apply only
to non-indexable exchanges (CGI, user input)?

This is not to say that TLS does not protect against attacks.  At the
moment the most obvious threat I can see that is really blocked by TLS
is not against privacy but against _integrity_, e.g. in the example
above, Alice's or Bob's ISP _injecting_ advertisement in Bob's
reponse.

Has any server author designed some sort of countermeasure against
length-based attacks?  Has it been already discussed?

Firstly, most Gemini documents are (intentionally) pretty tiny, fitting
within maybe 1 or 2 KB.  This is not so big an issue.

1) and 2) are too complicated (particularly with Gemini's spirit of
being able to implement all major features in an afternoon) and 3) is
just not backward compatible.

Length-analysis prevention is not Gemini's job, it's the job of TLS.
And TLS does provide a mechanism to defend against it - padding.  This
works better for smaller files as it is then harder to distinguish
between files of similar sizes.  I don't know how OpenSSL and other
common TLS libraries handle padding (I've read the TLS 1.3 RFC, and it
seems that currently clients and servers have to opt into using padding,
and the amount of padding and how it varies is implementation-defined),
but we can definitely look into it, and perhaps provide recommendations
for it in the Best Practices document (as seems to be what's happening
with close_notify(), IIRC).

Note also that for larger files which can be more easily profiled by
outsiders, there is no good solution.  Even with HTTP and other
protocols, attackers can clearly distinguish between a significant data
transfer (and can roughly measure its size), even across multiple
packets.

In conclusion, it's not Gemini's responsibility to handle these kinds of
attacks.  Some have suggested Gemini over TOR as a solution to prevent
the more invasive attacks, but I haven't seen much development on that
front.

hmmm,  with some form of padding yes. But without padding, I am not so sure.

I have seen many time this argument about complexity. I find it a bit
fallacious (no offense intended!). The client or server is "not
complex" because 99% of the complexity (TLS) is assumed to be already
implemented in a library available everywhere (eg. OpenSSL). We could
say in the same way that a modern HTTP client is not complex - and is
an afternoon project - because LibCurl is available everywhere :-)

My point is not about the protocol. Just what the capsule owner and
server software could do.

I didn't know about TLS padding. Thanks for pointing it out. I will
definitely look into it.
Has anyone already used it in this sort of context?

Hi Nothien,

> Length-analysis prevention is not Gemini's job, it's the job of TLS.
> And TLS does provide a mechanism to defend against it - padding.

You are perfectly right. The new  "record padding" mechanism added to
TLS 1.3 [1] is almost perfect for the job. Of course it doesn't
protect servers which serve few large files, but for the typical small
gmi files, it is perfect.

[1] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-5.4

Regarding support, It is supported by OpenSSL: see option 'record_padding'  [2]

[2] https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CONF_cmd.html

As TLS 1.3 is not yet mandatory for Gemini, and as several server
owners may not be interested by this privacy issue, I guess that
record padding may not be part of Gemini specification. But I think it
should at least belong to a "best practices" document.

A recommended value could be 4,096  (all served files padded during
transport to the next multiple of 4KB).  Servers serving high volume
of very small files (typically 0 to 2KB) could use 1,024 instead.

Thanks again for the suggestion

Phil

This attack is well known and, for HTTP, documented in many
articles. A general view of the problem and of countermeasures is
"Peek-a-Boo, I Still See You: Why Efficient Traffic Analysis
Countermeasures Fail"

4. The client could obfuscate the traffic with many gratuitous
requests. See the excellent book "Obfuscation"

TLS cannot do it alone, and this is why it is opt-in. Padding without
knowledge of the application is dangerous.

Gemini already works over Tor.

1) You can use a "torified" client or simply run an unmodified client
with a wrapper like torify. Note that many exit nodes connect only to
80 and 443 which may be a problem (less exit nodes => less anonymity).

2) You can easily configure a capsule to run under .onion

It works in Lagrange. I think gemini mandates absolute URLs, so that is
non-standard behaviour?

I think it's a case of failed pattern recognition. AV98 probably
thinks it's an absolute path where the scheme has been forgotten, and
so adds it. A bug, in other words :D

I wasn't implying length attacks are new :-)  (just gave an example
for people less familiar with the subject).

Thanks for the interesting "Peek-a-Boo" paper link (It also includes
several interesting references). I think it  addresses a different
problem (traffic analysis of an encrypted stream - ie. what
information can we extract from an encrypted tunnel traffic).

Length attacks on Gemini traffic are _much_ simpler and more efficient
since (1) the traffic is composed of independent TLS transactions with
one request and one response, and (2) responses are documents which a
publicly available on the Gemini server (except for CGI and client
cert-authenticated  traffic).

This approach depends on what are the attacker's objectives. If they
want to establish that you have accessed a specific sensitive
document, the fact that you also accessed many decoys doesn't matter
much - except if you accessed _all_  files and claim that you are in
fact just indexing the site.

Thanks for the Obfuscation book reference. Will try to have a look.

Cheers

Your stats.gmi page is a great resource for this issue (among others).

Given your current stats, the record padding value I suggested
previously (4,096) would be enough to almost eliminate the risk for
more than 80% of pages and significantly reduce the risk for more than
90% of pages. --  and we can agree that the one 903,321 bytes document
_will_ probably  be catched whatever the record padding :-)

I agree with you disagreeing! :-)  but I think Nothien means it is not
the responsibility of the Gemini _protocol_ to handle these attacks.
It should rather be the responsibility of Gemini capsule owners to
configure reasonable record padding for the typical documents they
publish.

So I think record padding belongs more to a best practices document
than to the spec.

Just writing this, I am wondering... with TLS 1.3, can the _client_
request record padding for the server response? I will check. If it
can, at least a client could take the initiative and protect itself
even if the server does no padding,

Cheers

Phil

Do you mean "rounding up" (by adding padding) all sent data to 4,096
bytes?  I agree, that should do quite well to hide most Gemini data.

Yep, that's what I mean.  Thank you putting that to words neatly.

Reading the TLS 1.3 spec[1], it appears not.  Oh well.

[1]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-5.4

P.S: I've been thinking about all the issues we've come across with TLS,
and I've been collecting ideas for a new transport security protocol.  I
know ~spc's stance on crypto ("get it approved by the crypto community,
make an implementation, then we'll talk"), and I'm not saying we should
switch to a magic protocol that doesn't exist; but that we should at
least consider making a wishlist of sorts of all the things that we
would want out of a "good" transport security protocol  (if you have any
such ideas, please share them with me).  I'll put up my crypto wishlist
sometime soon.

I experimented a bit more with this, and discovered that chains can be 
awkward. Not all servers support sending a certificate chain, TLS 
libraries may complain if the root cert isn't set as a CA, and we lose 
the efficiency savings of only transmitting a single cert.

But there's a much simpler version which avoids chains.
If your server is currently using certificate A and you want to switch 
to a new certificate:
* create a new self-signed certificate C with key K,
* sign it with A to produce a signed certificate S,
     (e.g. using openssl x509 -CA A.crt ...)
* tell your server to use S and K.

The signature on a self-signed certificate is worthless, so we lose 
nothing by replacing it with a signature from the old certificate in 
this way.

Clients can check for this as follows:
* When TOFU-trusting a certificate for a host, save its pubkey.
* If later a new cert is provided for the host, check if it was 
correctly signed by the pubkey of the old certificate.
* If so, accept the new certificate and delete the old one. Arguably 
there should be a warning if the old certificate had expired.

I experimented a bit with this, and the only small complication I ran 
into is that tls libraries may complain if the Distinguished Names of 
the two certificates are identical (at least, the haskell tls library 
I tested with does). But it isn't hard to include a field in the DN of 
the new certificate to make it unique.

So why don't we make this a convention? Any subtleties I'm missing?

Yes. When record padding is configured to a value X,  all sent data is
padded (of course before stream encryption) up to the next multiple of
X. So with record_padding = 4096,
a 1.5KB file is padded to exactly 4,096 bytes. A 5 KB file is padded
to 8,192 bytes.

A nice mechanism which is well suited to typical Gemini files
(according to Stephane Bortzmeyer's stats, 80% of pages are below
13KB).

Section 5.4 concludes with "Later documents may define padding
selection algorithms or define a padding policy request mechanism
through TLS extensions or some other means"

"Later documents..." So I guess, yes we are not there yet.

I think Sean Conner's statement is rhetoric or tongue-in-cheek :-)
Whether one likes it or not, Gemini IS built upon TLS. Period. That
ship has sailed.  So I understand Sean (and others) want to limit
entropy in the mailing list

I will be happy to have a look at what you publish and share ideas -
but probably not about this topic in this mailing list... :-)

  It's not completely rhetorical---it's to just shut up those what want
others to do the work.  But I mean it---present a working proof-of-concept
that has passed the crypto community and by all means, it'll be worth
talking about then (mostly about hose easy it is to implement across a
variety of languages).  Until then, it's TLS.

  -spc (We've already had one "proof-of-concept" alternative crypto, but it
	was rejected by the person who did it for further study ... )
