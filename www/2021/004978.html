<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Gary Johnson once stated:
&gt;<i> Sean Conner &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini">sean at conman.org</A>&gt; writes:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not if the CGI interface is properly written.  All I had to do was write
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this CGI script and drop it into my tests directory [1]:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	<A HREF="gemini://gemini.conman.org/test/pathseg.cgi">gemini://gemini.conman.org/test/pathseg.cgi</A>
</I>
  [ snip ]

  
&gt;<i> Thanks for sharing some code, Sean. I, of course, realize that one could
</I>&gt;<i> write a CGI script to pick apart the PATH_INFO for user inputs. This
</I>&gt;<i> issue I raised in my message was that this doesn't make any sense in the
</I>&gt;<i> context of a CGI script which is looked up using the path on the remote
</I>&gt;<i> filesystem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In your example, your script is located at /test/pathseg.cgi. However,
</I>&gt;<i> lacking side information, I see no indicator (outside of the --
</I>&gt;<i> admittedly optional -- cgi extension on your file name) of which path
</I>&gt;<i> segments should be considered part of the CGI filename lookup and which
</I>&gt;<i> parts are meant to be user input data in your example link:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> /test/pathseg.cgi/name=and%20a%20one/age=and%20a%20two/action=skidoosh
</I>
  That's a particular implementation detail of GLV-1.12556 [1].  Other
servers could require the extension, or some other mechanism.

&gt;<i> This feels like a massive hack to me and an abuse of path segments TBH.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I were to embrace this approach, I can see that I would have to
</I>&gt;<i> reprogram my server to do some additional path preprocessing magic. I
</I>&gt;<i> could either:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Check every sequence of path segments starting from the document root
</I>&gt;<i>    to see if any of them correspond to an executable file or have the
</I>&gt;<i>    blessed CGI file extension for my server.
</I>
  I see your server just accepts the requested path as is.  GLV-1.12556
(once it gets into the filesystem handler) walks down the document root
checking each path segment looking for an exectuable file (which indicates a
CGI script) or symbolic link (which indicates a SCGI script).

&gt;<i> Once one of these 3 approaches enables the server to successfully detect
</I>&gt;<i> that a particular path corresponds to a CGI script that is not actually
</I>&gt;<i> located where that path is pointing, then the server would need to
</I>&gt;<i> execute that script with PATH_INFO bound to the entire path. Every
</I>&gt;<i> installed CGI script would then be responsible for manually removing
</I>&gt;<i> SCRIPT_NAME from PATH_INFO and splitting it up to get the user inputs,
</I>&gt;<i> which puts an additional burden on CGI developers.
</I>
  If you want to follow RFC-3875, that's not the case.  PATH_INFO only
contans data past the script name (section 4.1.5). This link:

	<A HREF="gemini://gemini.conman.org/cgi">gemini://gemini.conman.org/cgi</A>

returns

	SCRIPT_NAME = /cgi

There is no PATH_INFO or PATH_TRANSLATED because it's not needed.  However:

	<A HREF="gemini://gemini.conman.org/cgi/path/to/nowhere">gemini://gemini.conman.org/cgi/path/to/nowhere</A>

returns

	SCRIPT_NAME = /cgi
	PATH_INFO = /path/to/nowhere
	PATH_TRANSLATED = /home/spc/projects/gemini/non-checkin/gemini.conman.org/path/to/nowhere

  The work is on the server side, not the CGI script side.

&gt;<i> So I've now heard from multiple folks that we should all just get on
</I>&gt;<i> with these path segment hacks and accept that as the best we can do in
</I>&gt;<i> Gemini.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While I can see that it's technically possible (though arguable ugly) to
</I>&gt;<i> do so, I suppose my question is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;What exactly does Gemini lose by allowing chained query parameters?
</I>&gt;<i> (with &amp;)&quot;
</I>
  Nothing as far as I can see, as long as the characters '=' and '&amp;' are
escaped if they appear in the input (to prevent confusion).  

&gt;<i> What am I missing here, folks?
</I>
  Somebody to do a proof-of-concept probably.

&gt;<i> Any chance of weighing in here, Solderpunk?
</I>
  Is he still alive?
