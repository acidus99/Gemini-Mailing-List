</I>&gt;<i> out of this lot, only TWO people bothered to try, and right now, between
</I>&gt;<i> those two peple, 50% are ready to dump the idea into the dumpster fire out
</I>&gt;<i> back (for the record, I'm that 50%), because the two camps are mostly

</I>&gt;<i> the game.  If setting up an account is too much, tough!

I *think* I implemented/tested/tried the IRI thing and I'm thinking that
I'm not in the group-size-two that you referred to.

The sentence I just wrote is *not* my point - I'm totally cool with the
above (what I and you and others wrote/expressed) - my point is... I was
thinking...

If I *thought* I tried out the IRI thing, but wanted to check, where would
I go? What would I test? How would I 'certify'?

If I wanted to be a part of the discussion in a
trying-to-implement-this-new-experiment way, what should I do?

I'm guessing that maybe an email to the list or a comment on a gitlab issue
to the effect of: &quot;I think this is what it means to test out the IRI thing.
I think I did it, you can try out my implementation like this...&quot;

That feels... good to me...

Thoughts?
