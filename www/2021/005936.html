That was a fair enough request. Yes, the party to which you refer is an
account that I filtered to /dev/null a long time ago. My bad. It
appeared as if you were referring to me.

You'll note I also cc'd you on this. It's my practice to set my MUAs to
only &quot;reply list&quot;, since that's where I'm conversing. I can't promise
anything in the future, but I'll try, and a friendly reminder with each
of your posts will help :)

On another note, I would appreciate it if you would take a moment to
ensure that your webproxy agent stays off my lawn at *.vger.cloud. I
have no qualms about other types of agents, I just personally believe
that people should use native Gemini and Gopher protocol clients (which
includes browser plugins such as dillo-gemini, qute-gemini, OverbiteNX,
and SSH kiosks) to browse Gemini and Gopher space.

My reasons are my own, and I do not purport to speak on behalf of anyone
else who manages Gemini services.

Kindest regards,
