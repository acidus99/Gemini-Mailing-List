</I>The only issue with tildegit is that it's restricted to people that are
in tildes.  You can request an account (real people are the ones
validating requests after all) but many people wouldn't want to sign up
for a new service just to work on the Gemini spec.  For instance, I
don't have a gitlab account and therefore am not participating in those
discussions because why would I make a whole new account for literally
one thing.  I do have a tildegit account which would make it better for
me, but then you'd be putting lots of other people in my situation and
cutting a lot of valuable contributors out.  And yeah, github is a no-go
for obvious reasons.

I would vote for sourcehut because you don't need a sourcehut account to
participate (same with this ML), while still keeping the discussion
separate from this list, which, IMO, should be announcements of
interesting software and new capsules and things like that, plus formal
spec announcements.


Oh yeah, learning to block users in your email server or email client is
a valuable skill, particularly on this list unfortunately.
