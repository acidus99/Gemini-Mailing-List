<PRE>&gt;<i> I'd love to build a team and get going. If anyone else wants to as
</I>&gt;<i> well, please say so.
</I>
I'm willing to help.

In the spirit of showing what sort of things I'd be about:

I like to use git directly. We can all collaborate using our respective
git repositories and pull requests. If one of us uses a repository
available via GitLab, SourceHut or some other platform, that's a nice
bonus, but as far as I'm concerned, I'm happy with using git, and
discussions on the mailing list.

I'd like to keep changes to the spec very, very small. For example, I'd
say that there &quot;must&quot; be a space after the asterisk in list items
because some people might start their paragraph with emphasis using
asterisks. I'd say there &quot;should&quot; be a space after the link indicator,
but there's no reason to make it mandatory that I've seen.

In an effort to show the kind of work I'd like to do most of all, I've
made some changes to my branch and would invite others to pull it.

The first one adds a section on dealing with bots if you're serving
dynamic content to Best Practices.
<A HREF="https://alexschroeder.ch/cgit/gemini-spec/commit/?id=efb2955e8d33a9d434c540f2a86be49a099066f9">https://alexschroeder.ch/cgit/gemini-spec/commit/?id=efb2955e8d33a9d434c540f2a86be49a099066f9</A>

The second one replaces gus.guru with geminispace.info in the FAQ.
<A HREF="https://alexschroeder.ch/cgit/gemini-spec/commit/?id=61584fce0680fe724b56cb40ea7fc09be3525ba8">https://alexschroeder.ch/cgit/gemini-spec/commit/?id=61584fce0680fe724b56cb40ea7fc09be3525ba8</A>

I currently run a very small wiki dedicated to Gemini, which is where I
would write drafts.
<A HREF="gemini://transjovian.org/gemini">gemini://transjovian.org/gemini</A>

The page I wrote today lists our git repositories, and has a copy of the
specification generated from the main branch of my repository. That's
where you can see the above changes in context.
<A HREF="gemini://transjovian.org/gemini/page/Gemini%20Specification">gemini://transjovian.org/gemini/page/Gemini%20Specification</A>

My preferred way of working would be discussing things on the mailing
list, me writing a draft on the wiki, and finally committing it to my
repository and then inviting others to pull it. For the two changes
above I skipped the discussion on the mailing list because I felt I
needed something to show before volunteering.

Based on the above, I guess I'm volunteering for draft writing,
maintaining one of the repos, and the process of getting things into
that repo, and less for lively mailing list discussion. In an ideal
world, friends would read the mailing list for me and summarize the
discussion for me.

Anyway, if you're interested in having me on the team in a role that
plays to my strength, then you have my &#8230; keyboard, I guess. :)

Cheers
Alex
