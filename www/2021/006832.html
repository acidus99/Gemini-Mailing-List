<PRE>Flounder.online allows sftp access to your user directory. Their web tools on the http site are pretty meh, and they have a few here limits (128k max file size, I want to say a 104 or so file limit. 10mb userspace limit.)

They also mirror user content for html browsers, which is how I found the site out. So also doubles as easy way to advertise your content on the Big Web too. Not perfect, but it's letting me built a site up and get into the habit of maintaining it so if I end up migrating I can just take my backup and go elsewhere. Also the server maintainer and owner seems interested in allowing users to compress their sites to .gml files but I don't know if there's been any work yet on they front.

Apologies for sounding like an advertisement. The place is really nice as a 'getting your feet wet' option specially if, like me. You have no disposable income.

&gt;<i> I know the maintainers of gemlog.blue intended their capsule to be a quick-and-easy way for new Gemini protocol users to learn the basics of the thing -- create an account, add a post, edit a post, delete a post. But my question is, is there any way to do a direct upload of a Gemini /file/&#160;to this capsule? If not, what would be a better Gemini capsule that would accommodate for direct uploads?
