I don't think BDFL is a single role and it depends on the nature of the 
project. If you compare a spec's BD to a BD for a large project with lots 
of churn (Linus) or a programming language (Guido), it might seem slow, but
I'm unsure if such different projects can be directly compared.

How Gemini's BD tends to chime in after pondering and waiting for moods to 
settle, and then  explain his process of thought in a clear, calm way that makes 
any camps in a disagreement feel like they've been heard is quite exceptional.

I think &quot;Let's rebuild the web, but better!&quot; is a common last refrain
of parties that involve alcohol and have hackers present. Gemini
is an outlier here in that it actually seems to be happening.

In short, I don't think absence or silence is really a negative 
in these situations, and should be seen more as a sign of deliberation 
than negligence.
