  I have nothing to do with Spartan.  Titan, yes---I came up with the
initial idea, and it's Alex Schroeder who implemented and expanded on the
idea.  But I have looked a bit into Spartan---it was developed by Michael
Lazar, and indeed, it seems to be &quot;gemini - tls + uploads&quot; (and he might
have been inspired by titan, inimeg or discursi.  Titan is more
&quot;an upload protocol&quot;.

  There was also inimeg: (the same as titan:) and yet another scheme
(discursi?) that I can't find right now.
