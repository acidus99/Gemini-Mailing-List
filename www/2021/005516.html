there is nothing preventing users to publish markdown files instead
of gemini files. On gemini, it's not mandatory to have everything as 
gemtext which would be reducing Gemini potential.

Like it is often done in gopher, people can have gemtext files as menus 
with their texts files in markdown that could be opened with a nice 
markdown viewer program, and links with <A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> scheme from the 
markdown file would be opened using the gemini client. That would be 
like using opening a PDF from a website and clicking on a link in the PDF :)

The workflow may not seem optimal but it's perfectly doable with the 
current state of the protocol.
