<PRE>That's dedication! I presume that was a lot of work.
Have you talked to the person who invented <A HREF="titan://">titan://</A> ? I think <A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A>
transjovian.org/titan is hosted by <A HREF="gemini://alexschroeder.ch">gemini://alexschroeder.ch</A> if I am not
mistaken, someone correct me.

You should also talk to @skyjake on <A HREF="gemini://station.martinrue.com">gemini://station.martinrue.com</A> who
maintains Lagrange, the only browser I know of that even implemented titan.

Right now, as it stands titan is merely more than an ftp alternative. One
that you can add version management on, as if you were running a wiki.
I'm not going to discuss the pros and cons of this spec, because I have no
need for it. It works against decentralization. And just for my own gemlog,
my toolchain would allow me to upload a simple textfile via scp/sftp and
everything happens automagically.

What I will say however is, try to live within geminispace for a few
months, hang around on irc and on station. You'll notice that there's a
certain minimalism vibe to everything. People have really great ideas that
change your perspective on what you think is necessary and what isn't.

</I>&gt;<i> Here is my proposal.  It will be in standalone Github project.  I am
</I>&gt;<i> interested to see the reaction.  The point of it is: Gemini as of today can
</I>&gt;<i> stay the same and problem of form submission can be done on top of Titan.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gemini as of today will not scale in interactive usability, because user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interaction is severely limited.  There is a statement that Gemini is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only for consumption.  However, we have to be realistic that for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usability of consumption to stay high, user cannot be asked to live
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gemini browser for HTTPS powered web browser to submit a post.  That
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> breaks user flow and makes Gemini not worth it.  Why to come back to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gemini if I just used standard browser to do something and in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process I compromised all the advantages listed above?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know this is not very progressive to say it, but why does it need to
</I>&gt;<i> scale? Why does everything always have to appeal to everyone?
</I>&gt;<i> Not to mention the well-discussed issue as to whether content *needs* to
</I>&gt;<i> be updated through a browser. My stance on this is pretty much: you have to
</I>&gt;<i> learn things to use things. And using sftp to upload a file as a bare
</I>&gt;<i> minimum requirement is not hard. And it uses a protocol made for file
</I>&gt;<i> transfer! You can even transport images with it! &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In all seriousness, there are multiple real life examples of this. If you
</I>&gt;<i> want to learn to drive a car you need to consider learning how to drive.
</I>&gt;<i> Who'd think that just because you know how to ride a bike, someone tailors
</I>&gt;<i> your car to work like a bike, you know?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> geminispace provides a nice retreat from the complexities of the clearweb
</I>&gt;<i> and it also makes you get back to tools that were around before everyone
</I>&gt;<i> decided that literally everything needs to live in a browser. It doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> mean that it's uncomfortable to use, but as skyjake once put it on
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="gemini://station.martinrue.com:">gemini://station.martinrue.com:</A> there's a reason text editors are there,
</I>&gt;<i> because text editing is hard. Adding that to a browser is tough. If you
</I>&gt;<i> make <A HREF="titan://">titan://</A> mandatory in geminispace, most browsers will instead to turn
</I>&gt;<i> to the shell where you have immediate access to nano, vim and emacs, and
</I>&gt;<i> what have you gained then?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know I am ranting. But it's been discussed. geminispace is feature
</I>&gt;<i> complete from a protocol end. And if it doesn't grow big, that's probably
</I>&gt;<i> ok. Because the people that are in geminispace are great as it is :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Titan protocol is a good step in the process and perhaps is the only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> required step.  I am not sure.  We have to remember about need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support multiple screen types from desktop to mobile and it is tough to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> create something acceptable and generic for user input under the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> restrictions Gemini protocol put in place.  I am hoping people here come
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up with something :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also would like to raise people's awareness, that if the network to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grow and get any close to big, people shall expect that network would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> promote payments models, because it kills advertisements so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> efficiently.  I think it is a good thing.  I want to consume a product
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and not to be a product.  If I am a product, then UI tends to focus on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> makings adds prominent and waiting my time. That goes back to value of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gemini and consequence of its proposition is non-add based models.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hope.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
