&gt;<i> It was thus said that the Great Mansfield Mansfield once stated:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One of my goals has been to have a client / server pairing that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supports helping non-technical users go from downloading a client to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; posting content as quickly and painlessly as possible. In my mind this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; means allowing new accounts to be created *without* moderating their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; creation... which leaves me wondering how I might respond to side-effects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like any unwelcome content (illegal, offensive, spam, etc.).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I understand that walking down a path that allows un-moderated account
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; creation is asking for trouble. I'm still interested in exploring
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the possibilities to see if a compromise might be found for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my implementations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I am not a lawyer, so take what I say with a few bolders of salt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   How concerned are you?  I can see where you might be subject to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * laws where you live
</I>&gt;<i>         * laws of the domain you register (for instance, the purely
</I>&gt;<i>           fictional .fd top level domain (Freedonia) might  subjects you to
</I>&gt;<i>           its punative libel and copyright laws despite where you or the
</I>&gt;<i>           server or your users are located)
</I>&gt;<i>         * laws where the server resides
</I>&gt;<i>         * laws where the user lives
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of those might be the same country; it might not.  The US has strong
</I>&gt;<i> freedom of speech codes and thus libel cases are harder to prosecute (to a
</I>&gt;<i> degree); the UK has less free speech and very strong libel laws (compared
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> the US) so you might be liable for something a user said.  Again, it
</I>&gt;<i> depends upon jurisdiction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I know the US (since I live there) tries to make a distinction between a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;publisher&quot; and a &quot;platform&quot; and one of the differences comes down to
</I>&gt;<i> moderation---do too much and you can fall into the &quot;publisher&quot; category
</I>&gt;<i> which makes you more liable for what is said than if you are in the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;platform&quot; category.  Too little moderation and, as you say, is also
</I>&gt;<i> troublesome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think I'm following your walk through the legal aspect... I guess that
was part of my thought process too... not too dominant, but part.

I'm not too worried - and now I can see how attempts to find a desirable
outcome from constricting and controlling too much might lead to an
undesirable outcome anyway if the situation is seen as more-like-publisher.
Good food for thought. I get the sense that you would lean more toward
little to no moderation, which can make sense. From the little that I've
seen, I *think* that if I wanted an 'account' on your gemini server I would
need to email you. Are you able to keep up with the invites, or, said
another way, do you sometimes wish you weren't in the middle?


&gt;<i>   Okay, ignoring legal liabilities, one way might be to use an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;invite-only&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> system.  The website Lobsters (<A HREF="https://lobste.rs/">https://lobste.rs/</A>) uses an invite system.
</I>&gt;<i> Users can invite new users (even ones they don't know) but they then become
</I>&gt;<i> liable for the new users behavior.  I'm checking the current moderation
</I>&gt;<i> queue for users [1], and while most are userid changes (foo changed
</I>&gt;<i> username
</I>&gt;<i> to bar), some users have been banned (mostly for spamming; one for
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;repeatedly trying to use Lobsters to whip up an online outrage mob against
</I>&gt;<i> organizations they don't care for&quot;), some have had invites disabled for
</I>&gt;<i> inviting too many other people who have been banned.  That seems to work
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> Lobsters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This idea of invites becoming some form of responsibility appeals to me
quite a bit.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Also, trying to invoke a community spirit can help.
</I>&gt;<i>

The link worked fine for me and I'm not a member. Interesting that there
seem to be a dozen to a few dozen 'moderation actions' a week.
