That's what I was afraid of with input codes.

I was thinking with my heart and getting carried away with the ideas for
things I could build and trying to find any way I could to make it work.

I've always agreed that setting up an HTTP server just for input defeats
&gt;<i> the purpose of Gemini.

As I say, my use case is community building, and for the ideas I was
thinking of, I just can't do that right now with Gemini. And that's ok.

They are actually capable of anything.  Titan works almost exactly like
&gt;<i> how HTTP input forms work, those are just wrapped up nicely in a GUI.
</I>&gt;<i> If you wrote a decent client for Titan then it would be
</I>&gt;<i> indistinguishable from an HTTP free text form.  It could work like the
</I>&gt;<i> in-browser Wikipedia editor and edit an existing page (which is what
</I>&gt;<i> it's currently used for), but it also allows you to just submit
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary text and your server can make use of a Titan upload however it
</I>&gt;<i> wants (add the text to the end of a page as a comment, etc.).  It's just
</I>&gt;<i> a matter of there not being much good support or software for it right
</I>&gt;<i> now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's pretty interesting though like you say, it's down to client support,
and if that's a bit hit and miss right now I should probably take a wait
and see approach.

Thanks for your reply, Alex, was very helpful.
