<PRE>Oops, I meant to say I started on it at the beginning of *last* year.

&gt;<i> Hi All.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On this topic, yet digressing a bit from Gemini, I started working on a
</I>&gt;<i> bulletin board (and more*) system that supports full interaction via email --
</I>&gt;<i> and only via email. The system is called friSBEe, where the SBE stands for
</I>&gt;<i> service by email.  I created it at the beginning of this year but haven't
</I>&gt;<i> touched it much since.  It's pretty raw, but also very flexible and could
</I>&gt;<i> easily be extended to support Gemini connections.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you're interested in this, check out: <A HREF="https://rawtext.club/~frisbee/">https://rawtext.club/~frisbee/</A>  And
</I>&gt;<i> feel free to contact me if you would like to test it out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * features include a BBS, a blog system, a choose-your-own text adventure,
</I>&gt;<i>   messaging between users (yes, text messages on top of text email), and a few
</I>&gt;<i>   others.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've been reading recent threads about message boards on Gemini, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thinking about the idea of gemlog-based replies (which have been around
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for quite a while now).  People have been dedicating a lot of time and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thought to making messageboard-like systems work over Gemini (e.g. ew0k
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and their CGI script for receiving notifications to replies to gemlogs,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and see the more recent threads), but I don't see the point of doing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this.  We already have e-mail based message lists, and we've been using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them neatly for long-form (and to a lesser extent medium-form and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; short-form) discussions for a while now.  E-mail has some of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; following advantages:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * decentralized / federated: there's no single source for e-mail,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   everybody has copies of the entire thing.  People can also make e-mail
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   threads, particularly of messageboards/lists publicly accessible, like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   the archives for this mailing list, at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   <A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/.">https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * well-established system: e-mail has been around for way longer than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Gemini has.  I know we all here love Gemini, but e-mail is going to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   work better for a lot of people.  There are already tons of e-mail
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   server setups and mail clients which people use - there's no need to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   develop more.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * notifications: people subscribed to a mailing list get mails, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   everyone already checks their mail.  There's no need to make new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   applications to poll gemini pages to see if there are replies or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   anything.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * just as much variety in mail content: by default, we use text/plain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   here, but MIME was created for e-mail in the first place.  If you're
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   in love with Gemtext, just send text/gemini e-mails - we can read
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   them, they're plain text.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Instead of creating message board systems on Gemini, create servers /
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; libraries to view e-mail archives on Gemini.  I argue that Gemini is not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; designed to handle back-and-forth communication, but rather to serve
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information in a single direction.  We must only use protocols for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things they are well-suited to handle, otherwise we risk losing their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; original purposes and leave behind a fog of unhelpful but deep-rooted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conventions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of course, I may be wrong.  These are just my thoughts on this.  What
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are yours?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; P.S: If you don't like e-mail because it's too difficult to work with,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but you like UNIX / shell scripts, check out leahneukirchen's mblaze on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; github.
