This has been solved on the WWW through Webmentions. It should be 
possible to bring this to a Gemini site, though perhaps not using the 
Gemini protocol.

Currently, if Alice writes a (micro)blog post responding to Bob's post, 
Bob can get a notification or display Alice's response as a comment 
under his post automatically. The result is something that can replace 
silos like social media; everyone owns their own sites and talks to each 
other, posting and repeating like Twitter or the various Fediverse 
microblogging implementations.

To bring this to Gemini, Webmention software could simply handle 
Webmentions with <A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> URLs. The sending of Webmentions could be 
done over HTTP, but the verification of Webmentions sent using <A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> 
will obviously use the Gemini protocol.

I'll be working on something like ddevault's openring 
(<A HREF="https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/openring/">https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/openring/</A>), but for saved Webmentions instead 
of RSS feeds; I'll probably include an option for Gemtext output as well 
as HTML.
