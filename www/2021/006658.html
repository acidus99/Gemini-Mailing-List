there a microcontroller you can buy with hardware crypto builtin for
pennies and crypto offload circuits you communicate with than implement
things like rsa or ecc over a SPI bus. You could run gemini on your
commodore pet probably with a setup like this, which would be useful to
have crypto offload in any IP networking cartridge for a retro
computer. High end server cards usually have this built in or via the
addition of 'cryptographic accelerators'. It's why we have standards
like AES so we can make hardware implementations of them.
