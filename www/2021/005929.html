I'm sure I don't know what you mean by, &quot;you two&quot;. I am but a single,
individual person. Perhaps that was a typo, I'm not sure, but you're
indeed conversing with a single person on my end.

Okay, Point of correction here. Drew, I know you to be an otherwise
upstanding person who prides himself in his capacity to provide service
to the community for a greater good.

But I stated what I stated, and that is not what I stated. Please do not
put words in my mouth - especially since I never said, *easier*.

I never implied that it was not also easy to use self-signed certs (and
most servers I'm aware of will perform this automatically if you don't
provide a certificate yourself).

What I said is that it is easy (rather, Easy Peasy, I think) to use
LetsEncrypt to handle all of that automatically.

Trying to imply that I said something I NEVER said, which implies that I
meant something else, is beneath you. Please refrain from such behavior
in the future where it concerns me - a single, individual person.

I'm not angry with you, I'll just chalk this up to you losing context
because you are  as passionate about Gemini space as many of us others
are that have been involved with the project since the very beginning. I
don't recall seeing any participation from you prior to about six months
ago. Again, that's okay, and I think your intentions are grand - don't
put words in my mouth though.

Kindest regards,
