<PRE>Idea I have for a tool that might be useful might not:

Concept is you feed it your top level directory.

It lists all your subdirectories in that and lets you hit a button and
it goes through EVERY file and if it's an index.gmi it puts at the
foot of the file links to any directory's index.gmi above it with the
directory name (listing top level domain as Home.)

Any non index.gmi file gets a footer that links back to that
directory's index.gmi file.

Note: Those footer behaviors SHOULD be editable, but i'm talking about
what the thing would do by default.

I would also want this program to make GMI files where you can type
out the thing, then at the end hit button to automatically add your
footer text as appropriate.

Also would like to have a feature that allows you to select text and
hit a button for it to turn it into ascii art (since i know a tool for
that exists) for the sake of making top of page interesting text
(would by default put the source text as the mouseover text for screen
readers or anyone who has unformatted text collapsed by default.)

Is... this too complex a beginner project for someone learning code?
It fills a convenience I would like, but at the same time I don't know
if anyone else would find it useful.
