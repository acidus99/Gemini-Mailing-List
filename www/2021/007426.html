<PRE>A TLDR: the ecosystem can evolve without changing/breaking the existing 
spec. Let's freeze the spec soon!

Agreed that the Gemini spec seems feature-complete for now. There was a 
time when I would've liked to see features like compression and tables, 
but the spec doesn't prevent anyone from serving up an alternate 
mimetype like text/gemini+gzip or csv. Clients like Lagrange can load a 
CSV document from a link as an inline table just like they load inline 
images (following a user gesture, ofc). This is a good example of adding 
functionality to the ecosystem without adding functionality to the spec.

&gt;<i>other than perhaps a change from TLS should it ever become extremely 
</I>&gt;<i>obsolete, decades from now.
</I>
Also agreed that it might be necessary to deprecate some TLS versions as 
time goes by, but that should be quite straightforward: deprecate one 
version of TLS, have capsules stop supporting it while clients support 
old and new versions, and then remove support from clients.

Speaking of TLS: ome people from the netsec crowd have bristled at 
Gemini's TOFU model, but I don't think fixing that should require 
changes in the spec either.  Adding e.g. a DHT of some sort doesn't have 
to change how the Gemini protocol works; it can simply be a thing users 
use to verify certs &quot;out of band&quot; the first time they visit a capsule.  
Stuff like Tor hidden services are also a good fit for Gemini (I think 
the part of the Gemini Space accessible over Tor is called &quot;Deep Space&quot;) 
and can mitigate the issues inherent to TOFU without changing the spec.

Adding features is typically misguided: it's better to *complement* 
Gemini with other protocols suited for other purposes than to *extend* 
it. One such protocol is the <A HREF="spartan://">spartan://</A> client-to-server protocol.  
Gemini can concentrate on supporting server-to-many-client situations 
while Spartan can concentrate on client-to-server communication.

(This is not necessarily an endorsement of Spartan; I do have some 
issues with it, but that's off-topic).

The ecosystem can evolve, but the spec seems about done.

Welcome back, Solderpunk.
