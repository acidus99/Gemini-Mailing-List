Wow, Three years of French at UCSD and I didn't make that connection. I
filtered that user a long time ago when it became apparent that I didn't
find anything  constructive coming from the account, for me personally.
I typically do that with serial Top-Posters too, I find that even more
annoying and detest having to continually scroll up/down/up/down just to
figure out what's being conveyed.

I didn't realize that DEAs were permitted now. I still block them from
purchasing many services from me - Google is the great facilitator of
legitimized Spam.

Sean's deployment of tracking issues via Gitlab was a great idea to
avoid noise while working, and effectively creates a WG (working group)
that can focus on the matters at hand.

Personally, I would have probably chosen tildegit, since many of the
major contributors are homed in that community, or perhaps Codeberg, or
even sr.ht (Yeah pls don't flame me for that - it's a good service), but
Gitlab works and isn't GitHub so that's good.

Thanks for that info Ben.
