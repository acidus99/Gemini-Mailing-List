Apologies for not making it clear that Dragonstone is in it's current 
state a horrible mess that only really works when you are a well sighted 
mouse or touchscreen user (That doesn't even include myself a lot of the 
time), which is the reason I'm giving it a rewrite (because one year 
younger me made terrible design decisions)

The settings button unfortunately has never been more than a placeholder 
and is always insensitive (it's a kind of reminder for myself, gui 
settings will come, promised)

On the popup window: I'll definitely make that one an option in the new 
version.

On the links: Can you give Castor a try and tell us how the buttons for 
links approach works? (I REALLY want to avoid having to include half a 
webbrowser)
(I had that one in the older versions of dragonstone, but I realized 
that inserting widgets into text buffers isn't exactly performance 
friendly. If that works I'll make it an option in the current version, 
although I'd have to limit it to a about a thousand links per page (I 
have to add a configuration option anyway, so this will be configurable) 
to avoid sites being able to freeze the ui)

I'll announce the rewrite when it is in a presentable state, but please 
don't expect anything before September. (School is keeping me busy)
Thanks you for trying it out anyways and giving feedback! &#128515;
