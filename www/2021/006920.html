I&#8217;d like to push back against this a bit. While I have an &#8220;if it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; mentality, one cannot justify running all old computers on environmental grounds because newer computers are so much more energy-efficient. Sure, the 486 in the closet might be capable of sending data over a serial port, but the Raspberry Pi it connects to that runs an operating system with modern TLS handling can handle everything the 486 can at a fraction of the power budget.

If you&#8217;re in favor of running (and keeping running) old hardware on environmental grounds, then it&#8217;s worth thinking about what a cutoff point might be for energy use. Last I checked, old computers have all sorts of useful recycleable parts in them, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with recycling a 486-based space heater after a fond farewell and replacing it with a 64- or even 32-bit Raspberry Pi that will be orders of magnitude faster at a fraction of the energy use, and be able to run modern TLS libraries itself.
