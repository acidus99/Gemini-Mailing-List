<PRE>JFWIW the current implementation of the topics system doesn't suit the
needs I have (which others concurred with at the time). I gave it a few
months but nothing has improved.

The vast majority of posts I'm interested in are still being sent with
[ANN], as in, topicless.

Unsubscribing alas as I seem to be the only person that finds the list a
bit unmanageable in it's current state.

&gt;<i> Hello! It's your friendly neighborhood list owner here, with some
</I>&gt;<i> updates about how we are handling list moderation. There have been a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of people complaining about the volume of posts on the list and the low
</I>&gt;<i> quality of discussions, and I'm going to do some things to help with
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Topics
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A reminder! This list has topics. You are *strongly* encouraged to go to
</I>&gt;<i> your user options page at <A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini">https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini</A>
</I>&gt;<i> and select the topics you wish to subscribe to, and tick the box saying
</I>&gt;<i> you do *not* want to see messages with no topic. This will help cut down
</I>&gt;<i> on the volume of messages you see, and keep them relevant to your
</I>&gt;<i> interests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You should also always use a topic when posting a new thread. As a
</I>&gt;<i> reminder, the topics are [announce], [users], [tech], and [spec]. The
</I>&gt;<i> intended content for each is as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [announce]: Official and important announcements about the project of
</I>&gt;<i> wide interest. Please don't post to this topic if you are not a list
</I>&gt;<i> admin!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [users]: Discussion relevant to &quot;end users&quot; of Gemini, e.g. announcement
</I>&gt;<i> of new capsules and services (e.g. search), hosting providers, clients,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. General Gemini discussion and advocacy. Excessively technical
</I>&gt;<i> discussion discouraged.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [tech]: Technical discussion of Gemini as currently specced, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> questions about client/server implementation, application development,
</I>&gt;<i> announcement of new libraries and other developer-focussed software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [spec]: Discussion about finalising the protocol specification, and
</I>&gt;<i> formal standardisation efforts. You should *not* subscribe to [spec]
</I>&gt;<i> unless you really do intend to engage productively in the finalization
</I>&gt;<i> process of the specification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Topics can be included, with the brackets, either in the subject line,
</I>&gt;<i> or anywhere in the first five lines of the message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # User Moderation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I get complaints about a particular user lowering the quality of
</I>&gt;<i> discussion on the list, I may, at my discretion, set the &quot;moderated&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> flag on them, which means I have to manually choose whether to approve
</I>&gt;<i> or reject their message. My moderation decisions will be capricious and
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary, and mostly based on whether I feel that particular message is
</I>&gt;<i> constructed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If someone is actually being abusive or making personal attacks or
</I>&gt;<i> harassing someone on the list, I will unsubscribe them, but you're also
</I>&gt;<i> encouraged to killfile them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Non-subscriber Posting
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, non-subscriber posts are held for moderation. I've been
</I>&gt;<i> approving basically everything that is on-topic and not spam. This is
</I>&gt;<i> going to change. Now, non-subscriber postings will only be approved:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. If they are announcements in [users] or [tech]. That is,
</I>&gt;<i>    announcements of new capsules, new services, or new software.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. If they are an on-topic, closed-ended question for group members,
</I>&gt;<i>    especially in [tech].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Non-subscriber replies in existing threads *will not be approved*. If
</I>&gt;<i> you want to participate in discussion, you should subscribe to the
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list. If it is too noisy for you, limit your subscription to the
</I>&gt;<i> topics you want, and don't allow messages without a topic. Consider
</I>&gt;<i> changing your subscription to a daily digest if it's still too much and
</I>&gt;<i> you can't set up appropriate mail filtering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Conclusion
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that's about it. If there are any questions or complaints,
</I>&gt;<i> please mail me directly (off-list). If we need to create a separate
</I>&gt;<i> gemini-announce list, that's possible too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Happy hacking!
</I>&gt;<i>
