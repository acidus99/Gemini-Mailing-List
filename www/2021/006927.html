&quot;Display&quot; is used throughout the spec.  I'm fine with using a more
general term like &quot;present&quot;, but maybe a separate issue should be opened
for replacing all instances of &quot;display&quot;.  And, yes, I do think clients
ought to include the scheme, especially those that support multiple
protocols; I don't see this as a blocker.

&gt;<i>Really, I don't think this kind of prescriptive text for the details of
</I>&gt;<i>how clients should operate belongs in the spec at all.
</I>
That's what the specification is: prescriptive text for how clients
should operate.  If the text makes sense, we should add it, and this is
a small requirement that brings a big benefit, as with web browsers
using SameSite by default.

&gt;<i>Perhaps it would make more sense to add some general discussion about
</I>&gt;<i>this issue, either to the spec or to best-practices.gmi, saying that
</I>&gt;<i>clients should ensure that a client certificate is used only when it's
</I>&gt;<i>clear that the user intends it to be, and pointing out these cases where
</I>&gt;<i>it might not be clear (links and redirects into the scope of
</I>&gt;<i>a certificate). Then let client authors decide how to implement this in
</I>&gt;<i>whatever way makes most sense for their particular clients.
</I>
This would also be good.  As I wrote on GitLab, &#171;&quot;MUST&quot; is what I think
makes the most sense, as it provides the most protection without any
serious downside. But if I'm wrong about that, then taking it down to
&quot;SHOULD&quot;, or putting it into the best practices document, is still way
better than nothing.&#187;

So, here's the next iteration of the text:

  Before following a URI which is in scope of a client certificate from
  a URI outside of that scope, clients MUST/SHOULD display the target
  URI and what client certificate would be used to connect to it.

  Doing this will help protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery
  (CSRF). It applies to:
    * following a link on a page
    * going through one or more redirects

We could expand on this with a short explanation of CSRF and maybe an
example.
