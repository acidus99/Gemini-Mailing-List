 &gt; Gemini seems to have some success

 &gt; or the other, we'll have to move further and tries to promote it to
 &gt; normal people. This is what is done for systems like PeerTube
 &gt; &lt;<A HREF="https://joinpeertube.org/">https://joinpeertube.org/</A>&gt; (or &lt;<A HREF="https://joinfediverse.org/">https://joinfediverse.org/</A>&gt;, which
 &gt; seems to be in french only)

There's also &lt;<A HREF="https://joinmastodon.org">https://joinmastodon.org</A>&gt; and &lt;<A HREF="https://pleroma.social">https://pleroma.social</A>&gt;.

 &gt; with a Web site explaining what it is, how
 &gt; to join, etc, targeted to real people.

By turing test I am convinced that more than 0 people on this mailing
list are also &quot;real&quot;, but I get your point.

 &gt; Now, don't get me wrong, I do not suggest to launch such a Web site
 &gt; tomorrow. Gemini is not stable enough, the specification is not final,
 &gt; and most Gemini programs are not yet packaged for typical operating
 &gt; systems.

The only email from solderpunk this year so far mentioned moving stuff
to another domain [1], which would be the right place for such a page.

 &gt; On a more community-oriented note, I would also like to overhaul the
 &gt; project's public face and delegate some of the responsibility of
 &gt; managing it.&#160; I plan to transition the project to a new domain this
 &gt; year, rather than stick with gemini.circumlunar.space.

back to what St&#233;phane Bortzmeyer wrote:
 &gt; But creating such an &quot;outreach&quot; Web site takes time so may be it could
 &gt; be a good idea to start working on it? (I have no special competences
 &gt; on that field, I just suggest a joingemini.org could be cool.)

This is probably the more interesting problem, a version of the classical
lack of content. But if there is a specific point to contribute, that
would probably be helpful.
