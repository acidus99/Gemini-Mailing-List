Of all the proposed solutions, this one seems the most obvious.

The main problem with it is the spec, as it reads:
&quot;Alt text may also be used for computer source code to identify the programming language which advanced clients may use for syntax highlighting.&quot;

which is what a lot of the alternative solutions are trying to accomodate for.

Using the alt-text for source code highlighting sounds like a fun idea, but does it 
really belong in the spec? It feels like a remnant of a cool idea that a programmer
*would* put in a spec in its early stages, since it feels like a natural fit, but maybe,
in retrospect, it doesn't really belong there.

I think it would be best to drop that line from the spec--which would mean changing it,
but at least it's not extending it--and adopt your proposed solution as a simple convention
for those who want to make their content easily available for the visually impaired.
