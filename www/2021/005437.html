At the moment there's nothing preventing a gemini client from running
an interpreter for a gemtext embedded scripting language other than
good habits and intent. The only thing anyone in the gemini-verse
can do to prevent such things is to not play along. Self-regulation
is all we have.

Maybe it's unfortunate that this truth has been stated with, let's call it
DeVaultian flair, but that doesn't make it wrong or even &quot;intimidation&quot;.

</I>
I think a returning a 58 error code (&quot;Client is broken and smells bad&quot;) on 
requesting favicons would be a more appropriate respons but I can see where 
he's coming from. It's a form of &quot;not playing along&quot; with something he might 
think is very detrimental to the health of the gemini-universe. Drew being
prolific and/or provides resources in the public interest should not be used 
against him.
 
&gt;<i> Think carefully about the consequences of using <A HREF="gemini://srht.site.">gemini://srht.site.</A>
</I>
It's a bit early for such warning. Gemini is commercially worthless. There
are no big consequences to simply moving a capsule. And if one thinks
gemini will become big and commercially succesful, now is the time to pay 
special interest as to what might turn out to be a slippery slope.

The web didn't get to be in the abysmal state it is in today by a few
bad actors with lots of influence who ruined it for the rest. It's mostly
been well intentioned people thinking &quot;This is probably okay. It's not really
worse than what other-site is already doing&quot;. Then copy/paste repeat that
for a couple of decades and you'll arrive at the Jenga tower of crud that
is the current web. The web is a poster child of the slippery slope argument in
action and something the gemini community should be wary of and keep a
keen eye on.

&gt;<i> Gemini is nothing more than a set of common-sense solutions to

&gt;<i> The secret to gemini is not what it restricts; but what it enables.
</I>&gt;<i> Constraint breeds creativity. 
</I> 
&gt;<i> I came up with the favicon emoji RFC because
</I>&gt;<i> I thought it was a fun idea. 
</I>
And it is a fun idea, but..

Another fun idea from the web is javascript. In essence it can be a really
convenient way to cross t's and dot i's in the content, and add some fun
creative flourishes. In practice it's turned the web into a network for 
distributing (proprietary) software and burying actual content for 
nefarious purposes.

It's not about what nice conscientious people will do with a fun extention;
it's about how greed and corruption ultimately can co-opt it for their
own purpose.

The best way to prevent going down a slippery slope is to *not step onto the slope*.

I think that for every fun extension it is wise to ask oneself the
question, &quot;Is this creative, or am I re-inventing the web?&quot;

&quot;Favicon&quot; sounds particularly web-ish, especially in light of the two solutions
already brought up (&quot;if the first level 1 title of the homepage starts with a 
unicode character, use that as a favicon&quot; and &quot;generating a colored icon or image
based on the hash of the domain&quot;), which do feel more in line with gemini.

Feel free to disagree with Drew's delivery, but I think it would be best to keep 
any arguments related to current and future gemini.

	cheers,
	Andreas
