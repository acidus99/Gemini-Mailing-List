<PRE>* Thursday, 2021-09-09 at 09:59 -0400 - Michael Lazar &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini">lazar.michael22 at gmail.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i>[spartan]
</I>&gt;<i>    =: /link Enter your input
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I honestly think this is a flat-out improvement over gemini's &quot;10
</I>&gt;<i>INPUT&quot; status (and I rarely say that). It avoids an extra round trip,
</I>&gt;<i>allows for better client UX, and is probably more intuitive.
</I>
We could actually get something similar in gemini by adopting the 
following convention: a link with a gemini uri ending in a bare '?' 
should have the query component filled in by the user. So following 
a link
```
=&gt; /link? Enter your input
```
in an interactive client would prompt the user for input *before* making 
a request to the server.

Pros:
* Avoids a round-trip.
* Clients could render such links differently, e.g. with an inline text 
box.
* Doesn't break clients who ignore the convention, as long as the server 
returns 10 to a request with empty query.

Cons:
* It's surprising; doesn't contradict the gemini spec, but impossible 
to guess from it.
* It's arguably an abuse of uris, since it's adding new semantics to an 
uri beyond its meaning as a resource identifier.
* Because of the need to return 10 on an empty query for compatibility, 
there's no way to represent actually empty input.
* It's not impossible that such an uri could have some specific 
meaning on some server. However, I think this is unlikely; certainly 
every CGI implementation I've seen won't differentiate between &quot;/link&quot; 
and &quot;/link?&quot;. But technically they are different URIs which could point 
to different resources.


Any thoughts? I'm not sure myself whether this is a good idea, but 
cutting down on that unnecessary round trip seems very appealing.

Anyone know of anything this would break? Is adding such additional 
semantics to uris a route to extensibility hell?

Regarding the &quot;empty input&quot; problem: the neatest solution would be to 
always terminate a user input query component with a newline. But it's 
probably too late to introduce that as a convention.
