I am very new to the game (this is my first mail in this mailing list) and
I never really participated in any &quot;protocol ecosystems&quot; in making.
Nevertheless, is there not a risk in that game that's
the most popular implementation defines the rule and hence, the game
is not being right, but being popular?

</I>&gt;<i> this was not clear, and I'm sorry for the confusion.
</I>
That is very nice to clarify that. But it still raises the concern of
such risk in
future by an actor of similar size: will the stick not overcome any
rational debate?

Also, unrelated, but I have learnt a lot from this mailing list through these
different debates and I think I start to have a better idea now of
Gemini's philosophy
thanks to you all (and I'm sure many of my first intuitions would have
first been
considered as anti-pattern / recreating the web)&#183;
This learning has been very organic, almost chaotic and only thanks to
the people
posting &quot;wrong&quot; initiatives here as the answer they receive served for me as
guidelines as &quot;Gemini philosophy&quot;.
Is there anywhere a more structured document, the equivalent of &quot;unix
philosophy&quot;
but for Gemini that would express the intention behind some of the
&quot;limitation&quot;/restrictions
of the platform that a newbie like me could refer to instead of
learning &quot;by chance&quot;
this through some response here and there (and sorry if it is an obvious link
that I am not aware about) ?
