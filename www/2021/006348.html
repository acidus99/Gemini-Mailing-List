&gt;<i> Hi Omar,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For GLV-1.12556 i would have to install lua, a language with which i
</I>&gt;<i> am not comfortable at all. Also my Linux Distro doesn't include the
</I>&gt;<i> LibreSSL&#8230; yes i know you can always configure, make and  make install,
</I>&gt;<i> but just want to install a gemini-server and not make a phd.
</I>
I can sympathise with this.  I haven't really even tried to run
GLV-1.12556 because of the steps needed to run it!  I have only talked
with Sean some time ago, he pointed out some issues with the CGI
implementation in gmid, and so I took a look at how GLV implements them.

&gt;<i> GMID i actually had considered because it is written C meaning it is
</I>&gt;<i> /fast/!  But i wasn't sure about the CGI capabilities, like which
</I>&gt;<i> environment variables are available for CGI programs. If you can help
</I>&gt;<i> me out here i will definitely consider gmid for both the production
</I>&gt;<i> and my development box and gladly provide you with feedback.
</I>
gmid at the moment shares the same problem of GLV-1.12556: it has
LibreSSL as dependency (which I don't regret by the way, it has such a
clean API it's almost a joy to use: compare the code in server.c to the
OpenSSL-specific bits in utils.c!)

[ I've started to develop a library to write Gemini clients and server
  that, among other things, has an abstraction over the specific TLS
  library: this helps for testing and should help with portability
  across different systems I hope. ]

The details of the CGI variable available are documented in the manpage,
under the CGI section, but there is also a test page I'm serving at:

	<A HREF="gemini://gemini.omarpolo.com/cgi/env/">gemini://gemini.omarpolo.com/cgi/env/</A>

I should probably link it in the README.  Note: that demo page it's
lacking TLS_VERSION, TLS_CIPHER and TLS_CIPHER_STRENGTH that I committed
early this morning.

There is also a similar page for GLV-1.12556:

	<A HREF="gemini://gemini.conman.org/cgi">gemini://gemini.conman.org/cgi</A>

[ actually, my page is inspired from the GLV-1.12556 one, not the other
  way around of course! ]

&gt;<i> As for the name GGI: For writing CGI programs /perl/ has been my
</I>&gt;<i> favorite language since eons - no discussions about
</I>&gt;<i> programming-languages necessary, you cannot master them all and over
</I>&gt;<i> the years you develop your favorites - so in perl there is the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;gold-standard&quot; package for CGI programs with the name /CGI.pm/
</I>&gt;<i> therefore i could not use the same name for my package. So i named it
</I>&gt;<i> /GGI.pm/ no evil intend, no re-inventing the wheel, sheer necessity
</I>&gt;<i> for a good and short name.
</I>
I think I misunderstood your last mail then, apologies.

Anyway, talking about timing, earlier I was re-writing my `man' CGI
script from rc to Perl!  (I'm not familiar at all with the language, but
I'm slowly learning.)  If/when your module will be ready, I would like
to play with it.  I have a couple of CGI scripts written in different
languages, and I'm slowly re-writing the ones in shell/rc to perl.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Stephane,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you very much for the update. That leaves me with three options now:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Try again to install Pythron 3.7+ on my stubborn development machine
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     (Oracle Lunix 7&#8230;)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Learn go really quickly and fork the Molly Brown server - i will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     call it &#187;the sunken Molly Brown server&#171; in that case
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Write my own gemini server from scratch in perl
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It really looks like only Molly Brown and JetForce have a usable
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> CGI-implementation. We should call it GGI, btw: Gemini Gateway
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Interface to distinguish it from CGI.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They're definitely not the only one: GLV-1.12556 and gmid (disclaimer:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm the author) have a complete CGI support.  GLV-1.12556 has even more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things, such as SGCI support; and you may want to count vger in that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> list too, even it's a little limited in this regard.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, why reinvent the wheel and find another name when the CGI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specification, modulo one or two environment variables (REQUEST_METHOD -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and is debatable), maps well to Gemini?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Best regards from Charleston (WV),
