<PRE>Hi all,
I have just started to get into Gemini, now running a simple server locally
with the Kristal client to test things out.

Reading the draft spec, I see there are only two ways to obtain input from
the
user -- via responses 10 and 11 (INPUT and SENSITIVE INPUT).

While this allows simple single-field entry of values to the server, there
appears to be no facility to allow users to enter multi-field, structured
data in a single operation -- that is, simple forms.

If it does not violate the fundamental tenets of the Gemini project, I
humbly
suggest an extension to the syntax of gemtext in the following manner to
enable structured multi-field forms. The logic and work here would be ~90%
on
the client side, as it is mostly a convention for encoding structured forms
within .gmi documents, parsed and acted on by the client. Form submission
would require no additional core server-side logic; interpretation of
submitted form values would follow the standard patterns of request handling
with URL query parameters.
No client or server state would be introduced.

I have used an encoding similar to what follows successfully in a past
'minimal HTML' project, to generate simple forms dynamically (but on the
server-side). I hope it might serve well to allow Gemini users a more
convenient way to interface with back-end programs, whilst preserving the
overall ethos of minimalism and privacy.

If the idea of adding a new link type to the gemtext specification is
anathema,
please consider the proposal as a purely client-side convention,
displayed but otherwise ignored by existing clients as part of the
&lt;USER-FRIENDLY LINK NAME&gt; portion of the existing '=&gt;' syntax instead.

--

PROPOSAL
5.5.4 Link line form encoding

Lines beginning with the two characters &quot;?&gt;&quot; are form-link lines, which
follow
the same rules as standard Link lines [5.4.2], plus a &lt;FORM-SPEC&gt; section
preceding the &lt;USER-FRIENDLY LINK NAME&gt;:

?&gt;[&lt;whitespace&gt;]&lt;URL&gt;[&lt;whitespace&gt;]&lt;FORM-SPECS&gt;&lt;whitespace&gt;[&lt;USER-FRIENDLY
LINK NAME&gt;]

where:

&lt;whitespace&gt; is any non-zero number of consecutive spaces or tabs
Square brackets indicate that the enclosed content is optional.
&lt;URL&gt; is a URL, which may be absolute or relative.
&lt;FORM-SPEC&gt; is a list of one or more &lt;form-field-specifier&gt; items, separated
 by the Unicode/ASCII forward-slash '/'. The client uses &lt;FORM-SPEC&gt; to
build
 a form entry popup, dialog, or series of input prompts to gather structured
 user input.

Each &lt;form-field-specifier&gt; follows the form

  T#VAR#DEFVALUE#LABEL

  where T &#8714; [ s | c | b  ]

's' denotes a string (freeform data) field;
'x' denotes a string/number SENSITIVE field, which the client MUST shroud as
  password-type data;
'c' denotes a choice (dropdown/one-of) field;
'b' denotes a boolean ( checkbox, yes/no ) field

's' fields are freeform text, and may be used for numbers, text, or freeform
  data. It is the server's responsibility to validate submitted data.
For 'c' fields, the first choice is the default, all following choices being
  delimited from it and each other by the pipe '|' character.
For 'b' fields, allowable DEFVALUEs are [0 | 1], [yes | no], or [on | off].
The
  client is responsible for detecting these and returning sensible
  counterparts to the DEFVALUE if the user chooses their opposites.

VAR denotes the name of the form variable when submitting back to the server
  upon submission.
DEFVALUE denotes the default value to be displayed in the form. For choice
  type fields, the first item in the choice list is the default.
LABEL is text to be displayed by the client explaining the form field.
Clients
 MUST use the VAR field as a default LABEL if the .gmi link omits one.

A valid &lt;FORM-SPEC&gt; field is of the form

  &lt;form-field-specifier&gt;{/&lt;form-field-specifier&gt;/...}

Example - three field form requesting a string, a choice, and a boolean

  s#DELAY#5#Delay in seconds/c#SIZE#small|big|huge#Size of
something:b#DEBUG#1#

Note the above example has no LABEL for the final form field, so the client
  should render a default label using the form variable's name, 'DEBUG'.
This would instruct the client to display a form, popup or series of prompts
  (in the case of a text-based client) to enter three items.
The choice field would default to 'small', the first item in its set.
The client would return a URI upon submission with the query parameters

  ?DELAY=5&amp;SIZE=small&amp;DEBUG=1

if the user submitted with default values.


A fully-realized example of this proposed syntax would thus be

?&gt; <A HREF="gemini://example.org/formSubmit">gemini://example.org/formSubmit</A> s#DELAY#5#Delay in
seconds:c#SIZE#small|big|huge#Size of something:b#DEBUG#1# Please fill out
this handy form

Suggested limits on form structure and data

Max &lt;form-field-specifiers&gt;: 8
Max &lt;form-field-specifier&gt; sub-field lengths
  (VAR, DEFVALUE, LABEL): 255 Unicode characters
Max 'c' type choice length per item: 64 Unicode characters
Max 'c' type choices: 64
Max 's' value: enforced by server-side endpoint handler
