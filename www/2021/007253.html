Thanks, so true! And so I began to write an RFD document for &quot;Small Scale 
Hypertext Information Systems&quot; in the same pad (carbon copy below):
<A HREF="https://pads.ccc.de/comp-infosystems-gemini-rfd">https://pads.ccc.de/comp-infosystems-gemini-rfd</A>

Please, anybody feel free to edit along and/or give other input, also on 
the name and the byline, and the whole endeavour, of course, as I do not 
want to diminish the efforts already put into the first RFD process. 

Shall we post to news.groups to discuss this RFD along the other? Cheers


--- alternative/additional rfd for comp.infosystems.small ---

REQUEST FOR DISCUSSION (RFD) This is a formal Request for Discussion 
(RFD) for the creation of the unmoderated newsgroup: 
comp.infosystems.small

NEWSGROUPS LINE:

comp.infosystems.small    Small Scale Hypertext Information Spaces

RATIONALE: comp.infosystems.small

The idea for creating the newsgroup comp.infosystems.small originated 
while drafting an RFD for comp.infosystems.gemini as Gemini has some 
overlap with Gopher. Both are hypertext systems much more focussed on 
textual content than the World Wide Web (with its portrayed surveillance 
capitalism in places) and thus address similar concerns. Here a joint 
newsgroup for Gopher, Gemini, and similar small infosystems is proposed 
for the following reasons.
* The existing Gopher and a future Gemini newsgroup do not seem to be or 
get too crowded each. A joint newsgroup would probably not drown in 
traffic, either.
* The joint newsgroup would also invite discussions of related systems or 
communities, e.g. individual or decentralized &quot;small web&quot;/&quot;small net&quot; 
instances such as personal diaries served via http(s) or any other 
protocol.
* A newsgroup not being restricted to a named protocol is thus also open 
for future discussions of yet unknown technological undertakings in 
establishing small or niche communities in information space.

Currently discussions about small web/net take place in weblogs, gemini 
logs, gopher holes, twtxt, mastodon, IRC, tilde spaces, and elsewhere. 
The newsgroup comp.infosystems.small could be a new common place. 
Oftentimes, the concept also is referred to using the mistyping term 
&quot;smol&quot; instead of &quot;small&quot; like in &quot;smol net&quot;, cf. e.g. <A HREF="https://">https://</A>
communitywiki.org/wiki/SmolNet


Upon creating the group comp.infosystems.small, the existing  
comp.infosystems.gopher shall be deleted or merged into  
comp.infosystems.small.


CHARTER: comp.infosystems.small

comp.infosystems.small  covers information spaces such as hypertext 
systems using internet protocols such as gopher, https, gemini as well as 
the technology and tools created by its various communities' members. 

Binaries should not be posted to the group.

MODERATION POLICY: unmoderated
