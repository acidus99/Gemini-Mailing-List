&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the things that I love about text/gemini is how it's easy to
</I>&gt;<i> parse, and being it line-based it's also really easy to stream it.  When
</I>&gt;<i> I started working on telescope, the idea of being able to stream content
</I>&gt;<i> was present in the design of the parser from the first draft -- it also
</I>&gt;<i> fit nicely with separation in multiple processes (one process does the
</I>&gt;<i> fetching, another one the rendering, and messages are sent from one proc
</I>&gt;<i> to the other.)  But other than knowing from the code that it should
</I>&gt;<i> work, I never played with this aspect of text/gemini.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fast forward various months, I've just watched the &quot;Why gemini&quot; video by
</I>&gt;<i> Tomasino and I got an urge to build something with streaming text.  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> attaching a very, very simple CGI script that streams text/gemini to
</I>&gt;<i> build an interactive chatroom.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is similar to the one presented by solderpunk in &quot;A vision for
</I>&gt;<i> gemini applications&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/users/solderpunk/gemlog/a-vision-for-gemini-applications.gmi">gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/users/solderpunk/gemlog/a-vision-for-gemini-applications.gmi</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and, frankly, I'm quite disappointed nobody has built something like
</I>&gt;<i> this before.  (or at least I haven't been able to find it.  I know
</I>&gt;<i> kensanata has made some experiments with a mush, but I haven't played
</I>&gt;<i> with it (yet))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is to provide two pages: one that accepts input via the
</I>&gt;<i> response code 10 and appends to a file, the second is a literal `tail
</I>&gt;<i> -f'.  Simple, but it works, and it's immediate.  As soon as someone
</I>&gt;<i> sends something, all the clients reading from `tail -f' gets the
</I>&gt;<i> message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (the various `tail -f' gets eventually killed by a SIGPIPE when the
</I>&gt;<i> client closes the connection and the server closes the script stdout.
</I>&gt;<i> It could take a while due to the buffering, but can be worked out.  I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know if servers are expected to kill the spawned scripts -- I
</I>&gt;<i> don't recall anything from the RFC -- but I'm probably wrong.  gmid
</I>&gt;<i> anyway doesn't kill the scripts, it let UNIX do its things with signals.
</I>&gt;<i> Feature or bug?  dunno.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't require a client certificates, but uses the subject of it if
</I>&gt;<i> provided.  There's a check that can be de-commented to enforce the usage
</I>&gt;<i> of client certificates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm hosting a demo at

Thanks for experimenting with this.

Ive been wondering about treating feeds as if it was a REPL, for group
projects. Ive never gotten around to IRC but Id like to think people
interoperate well in streams with heterogenous coding tricks.

&gt;<i> but I don't promise to keep it online.  It's a quick-n-dirty script
</I>&gt;<i> (less than 50 lines of -hopefully- portable sh), probably filled with
</I>&gt;<i> bugs, wrote only to be a demonstration.  I don't want to moderate it
</I>&gt;<i> if/when people write things.  It's really easy to host it locally, for
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. using gmid (disclaimer: I'm the author)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	$ gmid -x '*' .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> from the same directory where you saved the script.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to work with Telescope, Tinmop and Lagrange.  Kristall and
</I>&gt;<i> Amfora don't seem to support streaming, or maybe I have an old version.
</I>&gt;<i> Elpher doesn't stream by design.
</I>
Its always nice getting titbits comparing the browsers. Are there any
good research points which evaluate such things in a tabular way
(something I had originally planned but I lost 2 weeks with earache)?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope this inspires someone to build amazing things with the streaming
</I>&gt;<i> capability of text/gemini.  There are a lot of possibilities, for
</I>&gt;<i> instance capsules like station could stream the feed, or the
</I>&gt;<i> notification page; it could be better than clients continously
</I>&gt;<i> refreshing the page.  Think of it like some sort of &quot;websockets&quot; but for
</I>&gt;<i> humans ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gemini clients could &quot;ring&quot; or use some other kind of mechanism to
</I>&gt;<i> inform the user that more content is available in a page (for
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. Telescope adds a `!'  before the tab title.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
A nice touch!

&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Omar Polo
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S.: this is also a partial reply to the talkat spec.  I love seeing
</I>&gt;<i> what creative things folks are building, and I really hope the best for
</I>&gt;<i> mbays and their idea (if I got the paternity correctly :P), but I also
</I>&gt;<i> like the idea of doing these sort of things over gemini.  On one hand I
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to push gemini over its boundaries, on the other I love doing
</I>&gt;<i> that :)
</I>&gt;<i>
