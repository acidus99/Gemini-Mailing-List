</I>
Hi Omar. I'm not sure I follow you here. Could you provide an example?

My proposal did not (intentionally) associate any meaning with
particular metadata fields. I merely wanted to provide a human-readable,
Gemtext-format syntax for associating metadata (the bulleted list
attribute:value pairs) with resources on a capsule (indicated by link
lines).

Do you have an alternative format that you would like to propose for
discussion?

&gt;<i> Let's keep the metadata generic.  We'll then start using common keys
</I>&gt;<i> because, well, they're widespread (like Author, Date, ...) or expressive
</I>&gt;<i> enough (`Tags: music punk-rock' is pretty self-exlpanatory), while still
</I>&gt;<i> allowing authors to add whenever they want extra fields if they feel
</I>&gt;<i> like (there are people writing poetry, maybe they want to add a metadata
</I>&gt;<i> about the metrics?  or about a particular style?)
</I>
We are in agreement here. I do not mean to prescribe a list of
standardized metadata attributes in this companion spec. My examples
used a few that I made up on the spot (i.e., author, last-modified,
copyright, tags). I'll leave deciding on &quot;the right set&quot; of attributes
to those who actually intend to use metadata.

&gt;<i> (as other pointed out several time in the past, $DOCUMENT_ROOT is not
</I>&gt;<i> something set in stone.  We have single-user capsules, multi user
</I>&gt;<i> capsule with different URLs style -- example.com/~op/ vs
</I>&gt;<i> example.com/users/op vs ... -- etc)
</I>
That's a fair point, and one that John Cowan raised in his response as
well. Thanks for reminding me of this. In that case, we should discuss
how to remedy this issue.

One approach could be to keep the metadata.gmi file at each capsule's
document root as I originally proposed. This should be well-defined on a
per-capsule basis even on a server hosting multiple capsules in the
common pubnix style. It is simply the toplevel directory of your
personal capsule (i.e. ~/public_gemini or equivalent for user capsules
and whatever server-level document root is specified by the admin who
launched it).

This would put the burden on metadata bots to try and find these
metadata.gmi files at the appropriate paths under a multi-hosting
domain.

Without additional server-provided information, the bots may simply
resort to brute force checking every directory path on the domain for a
.metadata.gmi file, which could lead to a lot of dead-end network
requests.

Instead, I can think of (at least) two ways the server could help the
bot.

1. BAD: Aggregate Metadata Up

   Even though the visiting bot doesn't know which paths lead to the
   document roots of our users' capsules, the Gemini server does. At
   startup time, a metadata-exporting Gemini server could check each
   user's document root for a .metadata.gmi file. Any that are found
   could be concatenated together to form a single toplevel
   <A HREF="gemini://cool.capsule.com/.metadata.gmi">gemini://cool.capsule.com/.metadata.gmi</A> file.

   However, in order for this to work correctly, the server would need
   to apply two transformations to each user-level metadata.gmi file
   before concatenation:

   1. All link lines would need to be prefixed by the URL path that the
      server assigns to that capsule's document root (e.g.,
      /~someuser/).

   2. To prevent errant bulleted list attributes at the top of one
      user's metadata.gmi file (with no prior link lines) from being
      erroneously applied to the final link lines of the previous
      metadata.gmi in the concatenation sequence, a single link line for
      the current capsule's document root (e.g., =&gt; /~someuser/) would
      need to prepended to the front of each user-level metadata.gmi
      file prior to concatenation.

   These are relatively simple text transformations, but they do place
   additional burden on server authors, so this isn't my favorite
   option.

2. GOOD: Allow Metadata to Link to Other Metadata

   In this case, we just extend the metadata.gmi parsing rules for bots
   to say that if any of the link lines that they read in end with
   .metadata.gmi, then these can and should be followed for further
   metadata about parts of this site. This doesn't require any other
   changes to the companion spec as written except for that note.

   To make this work, at startup time a metadata-exporting Gemini server
   could check each user's document root for a .metadata.gmi file. For
   each such file that is found, the server can append a new link line
   pointing to that metadata.gmi file (relative to the server's toplevel
   document root) to its own toplevel $DOCUMENT_ROOT/.metadata.gmi if it
   exists. If a toplevel $DOCUMENT_ROOT/.metadata.gmi file doesn't
   exist, the server can create one containing just the links to the
   users' .metadata.gmi files.

   Note that this doesn't even have to happen at server start time.
   Instead, the server could program $DOCUMENT_ROOT/.metadata.gmi as a
   dynamic endpoint that checks for user-level .metadata.gmi files
   whenever it is called, thereby making users' metadata available as
   soon as the user publishes it to their capsule with no need for a
   server restart. (This is by far my favorite option.)

Okay, I think I've answered all your points. What do you think?

Best,
  Gary
