<PRE>Hello everyone,

I first off want to thank Solderpunk for making this great protocol, it is refreshing to go back to the basics.

I am Rose, I have been computing since 1994, when the internet and computing in general were simple and an actual joy. The hardware was less than to be desired but the simple internet more than made up for it. Of course as with any new technology, the corporations saw an opportunity to make a profit and so they did. Years went by and what was a marvel of ingenuity became slowly but surely a slow burn of shit.

Today we have what I term the &quot;HTTP monster&quot;. A handful of oligarchs have now ceased the whole of the internet, have turned it into government spying shit, the telemetry is out of hand and propaganda is the norm. There have been strides in the Fediverse realm and that makes me happy but what I longed for was for the return of the simple web as I remembered it. I heard of Gopher and I tried it but it didn't resonate with me, but a video on YouTube changed that all for me.

I subscribe to a channel called Distro-Tube and good thing I did because it was there I heard about the Gemini Project. I was all over it lol. I downloaded Amfora and Lagrange. I discovered gemlog.blue and flounder.online and set to code my first gemlog and first capsule with them. I am a web developer by trade and the simplicty of gemtext had me sold.

After a day of coding a website it is refreshing I can return home to Gemini

Thank you for indulging me
Yours kindly
Rose
