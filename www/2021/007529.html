Note that according to the current specification, clients &quot;MUST NOT
automatically make any network connections as part of displaying links
whose scheme corresponds to a network protocol&quot;. The notion that a
client should automatically make additional requests to display content
in-line is already antithetical to Gemini and is forbidden by the spec.

I suppose that such a feature could be useful for clients that may
display resources in-line only upon activating a link, but a common way
to address the problem of downloading such resources in web browsers is
to allow saving of the currently open resource or a linked resource via
a context menu. I think that something to that effect could work for a
Gemini client.

You note elsewhere that this wouldn't be a major breaking change. I
completely disagree. No existing clients can currently parse &quot;&lt;=&quot;
links. For that reason, new pages adopting the proposed feature would
break every existing client. Moreover, any content that for any reason
currently has a line starting with &quot;&lt;=&quot; with no intention of using
this feature would incorrectly be interpreted as a link by a client
implementing this feature, although this seems less likely.

A good work-around is mentioned elsewhere. Give the content some
content-type that couldn't reasonably be rendered by any client for
its ambiguity, like application/octet-stream.
