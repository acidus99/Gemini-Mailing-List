<PRE>He merely owns the website/capsule it's hosted on. Taking and hosting it, or even rewording it to avoid copyright issues, is a relatively simple task.

GitLab doesn't own the GitLab specification just because it's hosted there, and neither does the operator of this mailing list own this message.

I called those things axioms, which in retrospect is a little odd choice of word, because it's just that, something that is taken as true and forming the basis of the argument and not the argument itself.

I do not criticize him for taking a break, that's okay. My problem is with the way he returned, i.e., taking power he basically didn't have any rights to at that point. The only thing he's currently doing is hosting a website and capsule.

And, lastly this is not an open source project per se. More like a set of conventions projects agree on. In other words, a standard.
