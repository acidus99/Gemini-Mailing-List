<PRE>Hi Nothien,

&gt;<i> Length-analysis prevention is not Gemini's job, it's the job of TLS.
</I>&gt;<i> And TLS does provide a mechanism to defend against it - padding.
</I>
You are perfectly right. The new  &quot;record padding&quot; mechanism added to
TLS 1.3 [1] is almost perfect for the job. Of course it doesn't
protect servers which serve few large files, but for the typical small
gmi files, it is perfect.

[1] <A HREF="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-5.4">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-5.4</A>

Regarding support, It is supported by OpenSSL: see option 'record_padding'  [2]

[2] <A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CONF_cmd.html">https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CONF_cmd.html</A>

As TLS 1.3 is not yet mandatory for Gemini, and as several server
owners may not be interested by this privacy issue, I guess that
record padding may not be part of Gemini specification. But I think it
should at least belong to a &quot;best practices&quot; document.

A recommended value could be 4,096  (all served files padded during
transport to the next multiple of 4KB).  Servers serving high volume
of very small files (typically 0 to 2KB) could use 1,024 instead.

Thanks again for the suggestion

Phil

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seems that currently clients and servers have to opt into using padding,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the amount of padding and how it varies is implementation-defined),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but we can definitely look into it, and perhaps provide recommendations
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for it in the Best Practices document (as seems to be what's happening
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with close_notify(), IIRC).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't know about TLS padding. Thanks for pointing it out. I will
