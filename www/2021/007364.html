<PRE>Hi All,

I just want to quickly update people about the current Sourcehut
migration progress, and inform y'all of my plan. If you have any
suggestions or critiques, please let me know.


The following is my todo list:

[x] create Sourcehut project     ***
[x] create protocol issue-tracker
[x] create Gemtext issue-tracker
[x] license Gitlab repos
[x] clone protocol repo to Sourcehut
[x] clone Gemtext repo to Sourcehut
[ ] copy old protocol issues to Sourcehut tracker
[ ] copy old Gemtext issues to Sourcehut tracker
[x] create meta-repo explaining Sourcehut project
[x] meta CONTRIBUTING
[ ] meta README     ***
[ ] resolve &amp; triage old issues
[ ] begin accepting new issues

Note that the list is ordered in groups, which are separated by &quot;***&quot;.
There isn't any particular order within groups.


## Specific notes

I don't think that the meta README needs to be thorough. It will
probably just be something to the effect of &quot;These are the Project
Gemini specification repositories&quot; with a link to the website/capsule.

I will probably have time to copy the Gitlab issues tomorrow. I
obviously hope to get to all of them, but I might only get through one
set. I also have a medium-sized assignment tomorrow, but I don't have
anything else so it shouldn't be a problem. I hope to finish coping the
issues the meta README by the end of the weekend (UTC-4), though it may
be the end of Monday (2021-10-25).


Just to reiterate: If you think anything should be done differently or
in a different order, let me know. This plan is not set in stone - it's
my general plan.

Cheers,
