<PRE>Good evening!

(I know this is a long email - I'm excited to share some of what I've been
experimenting with. Hopefully it's coherent.)

I've been experimenting with a non-standard status code and I wanted to
share some details. I am running this experiment to find a way for users to
manage content using only a Gemini client and server. No ssh, rsync, vim,
emacs, nano, or anything else.


# High Level Concepts

I see status code 10 as the server telling the client that the user can,
&quot;provide short input&quot;.

I see status code 11 as the server telling the client that the user can,
&quot;provide short secured input&quot;.

I've been using a status code of 12 for having the ondollo.com server tell
the Mansfield client that the user can, &quot;provide long input&quot;.

The simplest conceptual adjustment is that there's no character limit on
the input a client might provide in request/response input cycle involving
a status code of 12. Status codes 10 and 11 have specified limits around 1k
bytes (I'm fudging the details there). Status codes 10 and 11 also have the
specified behavior of putting the user input into the URL as the value of
the query component. So... the simple part is that there's no limit to the
number of bytes sent from a client to a server in a request/response input
cycle involving a status code of 12.

To escape the 1k limits of the URL in responses to 10 and 11, my
exploration of status code 12 places the user input in the body. This meant
I had to change my server from only understanding how to process the single
request line of standard requests to processing the request line *and* the
body when it sees a response to a 12. So I needed to tell the difference
between requests with a body and ones without.


# Some of the Consequences of the Above Approach

Since I then needed to be able to tell the difference between requests that
didn't have a body and those that should, I modified the server to provide
unique links to the client. These unique links use a UUIDv4 that is tracked
on the server and expire after a day. These are, IMO, the
geminispace equivalent of server side sessions. I say the
geminispace equivalent since they do as little as possible and only for the
purpose of getting simple content from the writer to the reader. (The
current spec says as much and explains additional privacy benefits of this
concept of server-side sessions.) Because the goal is to help users manage
content (or resources) using only a Gemini client, internally the UUID is
paired with the clients certificate fingerprint and originally requested
resource. In practical details, the resource is the page the user is
editing.

So. If a client provides a certificate and a URL that contain the
fingerprint and UUID (respectively) that the server is tracking, the server
will accept the body of the request as the value of the originally
requested resource.

To make the impact of certificate fingerprints line up more with *all* of
the content a user might want to manage, the user must create an account on
the ondollo.com server first. This account creation process is very very
simple. The only step is to visit this link [1]:

=&gt; <A HREF="gemini://ondollo.com/internal/account/create">gemini://ondollo.com/internal/account/create</A>

The certificate used when visiting that url is the certificate required to
be provided when managing content in that account, since it's the
certificate that will be paired with the UUID and originally requested
resource on any resource that provides edit or create links. (This concept
is also explored a bit in the current spec, and mentioned that it could be
thought of as analogous to the .authorized_keys file on an SSH server.)

[1] - After creating an account you'll get a status code of 20 in response,
with unique links as described above - if you use those links you'll get a
status code of 12 containing the current value of the resource as the body
of the response and letting you manage your content as this email describes
(assuming your client supports sending requests with a body).


# Concerns About Certificates in Geminispace

This puts additional emphasis on the geminispace use of certificates. We
feel we've lined up with the current spec quite well on this. If a client
created content with a certificate and then lost the certificate, the
content would no longer be accessible for writing. If an account were
created with a certificate and then the user lost that certificate, the
account would no longer be accessible. If a client allowed more than one
certificate to be locked to ondollo.com, then the user could choose between
more than one account anytime they visited. If a user chose a certificate
that had never been registered with an ondollo.com account, the server
would have no way of knowing that that user might already have an account
under a different certificate.

There is an additional concern about 'leaking' the certificate. If a
certificate is used to create an account, it becomes a form of
username/password. If that same certificate were presented to other servers
as a user were browsing through geminispace, the other servers would have
access to any resources in that account that had been limited to only those
who can present the original certificate. (At least, I think that's true
from my limited understanding of certificates. I'd *love* to be proven
wrong on this.) IMO this means that Gemini Clients must allow and encourage
users to 'lock' certificates to specific sites (urls? hostnames? domains?).
(Here, again, the current gemini specification seems to agree and mentions
this as a concern that client implementers should watch for and enable
users to manage - by hostname+path, locking all urls with that pair as a
prefix.) The Mansfield client was modified in two ways to support the above.

The first was simple - allow a user to lock a certificate to a hostname.
Then, every time the client navigated anywhere, it would check the
lockfiles to see if the hostname it was about to open a connection to had
already been locked to a cert. If it had been locked to a cert, that cert
would be used for all communication with that hostname, including the
initial connection. (We're still on the fence about locking to the
hostname+path pair, but we lean on the side of considering it a
'good-thing' that we'll probably implement.)

The second adjustment to support user privacy is that the Mansfield client,
on start-up, generates an in-memory-only cert. This isn't secure memory, or
memory that can not be flushed to disk, this is just a certificate that
can't be reused after the client is shutdown. This is done so that if the
user navigates to any hostname that is *not* locked to any other
certificate, the in-memory cert created at startup will be used. This
removes the possibility of leaking a locked cert. We think that a
recommendation along the lines of generating an in-memory cert like this
might improve the current gemini spec.


# After-thoughts

One additional point - the account name used when following this cert-based
process is based on the subject-common-name element in the cert. To deal
with collisions, the first few characters from the certificate fingerprint
are combined with the above common-name. We plan to eventually add
functionality that allows users to register a pseudonym that takes the
place of that common-name+fingerprint-prefix pair and would be more human
friendly.

Ah... and another point... how does the server know when to stop reading
the body of a request that pairs up with a 12? Well... there's a deadline
on the connection. You'll want to get all your data across before then. We
don't really like that that's all we have... we've thought about
implementing something more, but other options currently feel just as
arbitrary... some max byte size?

Finally - thanks for reading all this. I need to stop typing... I've been
typing this for the last hour and a half! :-D

If a status code of 12 makes it in to the spec or not is fine with us. We'd
love to see more servers and clients fight for the user. (Yes, I've been
watching certain movies recently.) We believe creation of content should be
as simple as consumption, and we're enjoying exploring this approach as an
option.

Thanks!
