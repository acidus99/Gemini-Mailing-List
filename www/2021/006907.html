<PRE>This is a sort of continuation of a prior thread I had made about the least powerful hardware that could use Gemini. 

I honestly feel bad about this as I have neither real hardware of the era, nor do I have coding experience. However in theory Gemini would be great for retro enthusiasts as it would give them something compsritovely resource light while also being actively worked on.

Projects like The Old Web exist, and frankly make me smile as it gives old hardware a way to Web, or at least explore the web that was, somewhat natively. However I feel trying to force Big Web on such old machines is 'solving' the square peg round hole problem with a sledgehammer.

Problem is while gopher roots would hint at the audiance here has a higher than average number of retro enthusiasts there is no gurentee at anyone caring to see what, say, Lagrange can be ported to.

I also have another thought for devices that can't natively do tls involving both a client, and a pi zero, or Arduino, or even something built into that wifi to serial port device (forget the name but that is just so danged handy to have if you retro.) To handle the security bits so that those older devices can join in on the fun.

Let the web demand more and more resources. Give old platforms as well as new access to Gemini.

I just... Don't know if anyone here is actually interested in Doing The Thing. I just think it'd be neat and would get coverage by people like Micheal mjd, lgr, etc alongside.
