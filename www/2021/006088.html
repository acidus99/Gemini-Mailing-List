 &gt;&gt;&gt; Thirdly and lastly, about Gitlab. I strongly dislike the fact that
 &gt;&gt;&gt; discussions which can have quite an impact on all Gemini users are
 &gt;&gt;&gt; happening in Gitlab issues; to stay up-to-date on all these
 &gt;&gt;&gt; requires regularly going through multiple webpages, and to comment
 &gt;&gt;&gt; requires a Gitlab account! I think this is a mistake.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; Agree, even with this one.
 &gt;
 &gt; Group work is funny. When the discussion on the specification was on
 &gt; the mailing list, everybody complained that it made a lot of messages,
 &gt; that it was difficult to follow, to know for sure what was decided or
 &gt; not, etc. (I did share some of these complaints but not all; many
 &gt; problems were simply because some people do not use some features of
 &gt; their email client, such as threading and full-text search.) Nobody
 &gt; defended the mailing list and asked for the specification discussion
 &gt; to remain there.

I think that was because nobody (or at least not many people) had the idea to
ever switch to another system. The mailing list seemed to be the chosen system
by Solderpunk at the time so nobody questioned it. And since it is pretty easy
to find a point that makes you not like something, switching was bound to make
some people unhappy.

That said, I want to do some complaining too, hoping that somebody has a
solution: Imagine that as with the mailing list before, I (only) want to read
all the discussions without going through all the separate issue pages (I think
that's what PJ vM was trying to point out). I found that Gitlab provides an
atom feed[1], which I hoped would do exactly what I wanted. But there are
several problems with it:

a) It is not a valid atom feed [2].
b) It seems that it only contains the first comment of each issue and to
 &#160;&#160; follow the discussion, I once again have to go through all the pages.

I hope that I was just too stupid to find the link that lets me look at all
comments in a feed format. Or if Gitlab does not provide that, maybe someone
can build a thing that lets us do that. I think that would be really helpful.

Regards,
Johann
