Yes, it is the nature of an email list to become noisy when the
population and popularity of that list increases.

So the WG style discussions for finalizing the Gemini spec have migrated
to a platform which is [also] well suited for such purposes. As a
platform, it is Perhaps even better equipped to compartmentalize and
focus upon each particularity that needs focused attention.

Issues can be isolated and related discussions can remain on topic there
in the issue tracker much more coherently.

I don't see how lamenting the move to a Gitlab issue tracker system
elswhere (here on this list) is going to facilitate the discussions
occuring there, and to be certain, one can participate there if those
are important issues for them or they can choose not to participate.

As far as what I've observed (I'm still going back over all of the
archives on my mail server) with respect to people leaving the list due
to complaints related to traffic, I've noticed that most of those were
folks that were of the, let's say, 'user' class, who found the nebulous
and arcane joo joo black arts of the core development and
standardization process too overhwelming to enjoy.

I've also noticed, not as many, but several technically minded folks
leaving citing disdain for banter and discussion that isn't specifically
related to the canonization of Gemini protocol specifications and the
development cycle of software.

I think this list will evolve over time to be a more user centric
resource medium with the more occasional announcements related to core
dev topics, with a lot more of the development related discussions
taking place in arenas more centric to actual development.

That's just kinda what I figure. But it does little to no good to
complain here about a discussion taking place elsewhere when anyone's
invited - if it is something important to a person, it stands to reason
that they'll make their positions heard where the majority of such
impactful discussions are currently taking place.

In the end, it really is a matter of what, &quot;Is, is&quot;, and right now,
those matters are being *decided* elsewhere.

I hope that helps :)

Kindest regards,
