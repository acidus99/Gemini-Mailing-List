</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It was thus said that the Great Omar Polo once stated:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Other than that, the other features are pretty much what you'd expect:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; virtual hosts, configuration file with per-location rules, CGI scripts,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; punycode, IRIs, directory listings ecc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   The CGI support seems ... not quite the CGI that I know.  It's closer to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SCGI, but even then, it's not SCGI.  Looking at the code, any currently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; written CGI script for Gemini won't work out of the box.  You might want to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think about calling it something else, or work to getting actual CGI or SCGI
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support going (SCGI is closer to what you are doing).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   -spc
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for taking the time and read the code.  
</I>
  You're welcome.

&gt;<i> By re-reading RFC3875 I assume that, except for the environment
</I>&gt;<i> variables that I'll double check later, I only need to execute the
</I>&gt;<i> script in the script directory instead of the vhost one.  The RFC
</I>&gt;<i> mention passing data in stdin, but it seems only for POST requests and
</I>&gt;<i> I'm assuming Gemini ones are ``GET''.  It also mention parsing the query
</I>&gt;<i> and passing it as argument to the script: this is something interesting,
</I>&gt;<i> but I'm not sure how to spilt it?  The &amp; doesn't seem widespread here,
</I>&gt;<i> so I have to pass the whole query as first argument?
</I>
  You don't split the query.  You pass it in, as is, from the request, in
QUERY_STRING.  Play around with:

	<A HREF="gemini://gemini.conman.org/cgi">gemini://gemini.conman.org/cgi</A>

It will show all the variables, command line arguments and a breakdown of
the query string.

&gt;<i> Of course I'd like to have a complete CGI support, and not something
</I>&gt;<i> merely closer, so I'll take some time to read how other servers are
</I>&gt;<i> handling them, starting from your GLV-1.12556.
</I>
  Warning about my server---the CGI implementation also allows one to run
CGI scripts for a webserver (and Apache in particular) so be aware of that.

&gt;<i> I'd like too, as pointed by John Cowan, to have a best-practices or a
</I>&gt;<i> companion specification for CGI on Gemini, as RFC3875 seems quite
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP-specific, but I don't think I'm the most qualified to write one :D
</I>
  It's not as HTTP-specific as it may seem---the only bit where it's an
issue is the REQUEST_METHOD.  My server sets it to &quot;&quot; (as there is no method
for Gemini, and what I think it should be, given RFC-3875 makes it
mandatory); others set it to &quot;GET&quot;.  Aside from that, it's quite generic.
