</I>&gt;<i> Thank you.  A few thoughts:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I recommend making each change in a separate commit, to make it easier
</I>&gt;<i> to isolate and comment on.  In a huge diff like this [1] it's easy to
</I>&gt;<i> miss small, but important changes.
</I>
  Further changes should be less massive.  I know this change is large, but
only because I felt it easier to just rewrite the document from scratch than
try to adjust the existing one.

&gt;<i> [1] 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://gitlab.com/gemini-specification/protocol/-/commit/0235100151b57d9f5c3384acdacb4ad9986f7ae4?expanded=1&amp;view=inline">https://gitlab.com/gemini-specification/protocol/-/commit/0235100151b57d9f5c3384acdacb4ad9986f7ae4?expanded=1&amp;view=inline</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The use of an existing TLS library SHOULD be used, but because not all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;existing TLS libraries support TLS 1.3, then at this time (2021),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;implementations MUST support TLS version 1.2 or higher.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You probably meant to start with &quot;An existing TLS library SHOULD be
</I>&gt;<i> used&quot;, but what does this actually mean?  Existing as of when?  If
</I>&gt;<i> someone makes a new TLS library, it will also exist.  Also, many
</I>&gt;<i> libraries are abandoned, so it will never be the case that &quot;all existing
</I>&gt;<i> TLS libraries&quot; will support TLS 1.3, or even 1.2.
</I>
  Okay, I reworked this paragraph:

	At the time of writing (2021), not all existing TLS libraries
	support TLS 1.3, but a majority (all?) do support TLS 1.2, thus TLS
	1.2 is the minimum required version.  Implementations MUST support
	TLS SNI (Server Name Indication), and servers MUST use the TLS
	close_notify implementation to close the connection.  Clients SHOULD
	NOT close a connection by default, but MAY in case the content
	exceeds constraints set by the user.

&gt;<i> I don't think the final Gemini specification should mention libraries at
</I>&gt;<i> all.  They may be ok as a temporary justification for why TLS 1.2 is in
</I>&gt;<i> the spec, but let's see if we can get more clarity on this: what exactly
</I>&gt;<i> are we waiting for before TLS 1.3 becomes the minimum version?  Support
</I>&gt;<i> in BearSSL (which may never be added)?  Support in X% of clients and Y%
</I>&gt;<i> of servers?  Hard to say, isn't it?
</I>
  One reason was the use of LibreSSL, which (until relatively recently) only
support TLS 1.2, and there were several large sites using LibreSSL
(including mine, until I switched to using OpenSSL and libretls).  Also,
stats [1] show that some 21% of Gemini sites still use TLS 1.2.  Personally,
I think that once this falls below 5% (or greater than 95% of all sites
support TLS 1.3) we can revisit this decision.

&gt;<i> &gt;TLS 1.2 will send the server name and the client certificate (if used)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;in the clear
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> TLS 1.3 also sends the server name (SNI) in the clear, unless ECH/ESNI
</I>&gt;<i> is used.  The issue here is that TLS 1.2 is not compatible with
</I>&gt;<i> ECH/ESNI.  But even with TLS 1.3, public keys need to be put in DNS in
</I>&gt;<i> order for ECH/ESNI to work, so it will probably not be a mainstream
</I>&gt;<i> feature (although it should be encouraged).
</I>
  This, I did not know.  I'm not sure what to say about this.

&gt;<i> &gt;A client MAY warn a user of a TLS 1.2 connection is established, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;SHOULD warn the user of a client certifiate will be transmitted via
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;TLS 1.2.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's &quot;if&quot; rather than &quot;of&quot;, right?
</I>
  Yes, fixed.  Thanks.
