Yes, that's a risk indeed. I think it's a well-managed risk in Gemini
right now, we have a huge selection of client and server softwares to
choose from and no single actor has a dominant role. And unlike web
browsers, new Gemini software can be written and useful in the span of a
weekend, providing an easy escape hatch - but this will change if we're
not strict in limiting the scope of the protocol.

&gt;<i> That is very nice to clarify that. But it still raises the concern of

</I>
I do realize that srht.site has the potential to become sizable enough
to carry substantial influence on the direction of Gemini. However, I
don't want it to do so: srht.site should only be a boon to the
community, not a risk or a political tool. I pledge to not use it as a
platform for pushing any opinionated decisions which are not already
representative of the community consensus.

I can't say this for the next service that comes along, but hopefully it
helps to set the tone.

&gt;<i> Also, unrelated, but I have learnt a lot from this mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> through these different debates and I think I start to have a better

</I>
The FAQ helps a lot:

<A HREF="gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/faq.gmi">gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/faq.gmi</A>

But I think a lot of people don't read it, or perhaps forget about it,
because many of the proposals oft floated are clearly not in the spirit
of Gemini as laid down by the upstream documentation.
