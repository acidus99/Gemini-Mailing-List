</I>

If you chose such a link, you'd in principle get all 40,000+ document
links, since there are no restrictions.  But in fact you'd get an error
page telling you that you asked for too many documents.  There will be a
different link altogether for interactive search, where you would be asked
using a 10 response to enter keywords from the metadata (language, author,
title, Library of Congress subject classification, etc.)  However, that's
inherently less precise: if you provided keywords &quot;Mark Twain&quot;, you'd get
both books by him and books about him, such as _My Mark Twain_ by William
Dean Howells.


&gt;<i> In the end, someone had to write it out by hand,
</I>

True.  But it isn't particularly difficult, either.  I'll put some samples
on the interactive search page along with the actual interactive link.


&gt;<i> I completely understand that such a search function is
</I>&gt;<i> needed, and I obviously can't stop you from using this format if you
</I>&gt;<i> want, but I do feel that there is a better way to pull it off.  For
</I>&gt;<i> example, if you're just searching for an author, you could make an
</I>&gt;<i> author-searching page where the query string is only the author name.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
With so many pages to search, all the search terms are ANDed together: the
more keywords, the less output to look through.  (I'm not sure what the
upper limit on results will be: for Google it's 1000.)  You probably don't
want all the works by one author anyhow: you want the ones you can read.

Also, under my system, the URL you've given says nothing about the
&gt;<i> language of the interface (e.g. the &quot;Les oeuvres de Jules Verne en
</I>&gt;<i> fran&#231;ais&quot;, which would presumably be in the header of the search page).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The search engine doesn't know what the link looks like.  I suppose that
could be passed in the query too: &quot;...
&amp;linktext=Les%20oeuvres%20de%20Jules%20Verne%20en%20fran&#231;ais&quot;, for example.

Under my system, prepending 'fr.' to the domain would effectively
&gt;<i> request that the server use a French interface, so that everything from
</I>&gt;<i> the returned text/gemini documents to error messages would be in French.
</I>&gt;<i> But the URL would be otherwise unaffected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Fine as far as the error messages are concerned.  But just because you want
a French interface, it doesn't necessarily mean you want to reject English
or German books from the search.

It's the old, old story.  Droid meets droid.  Droid becomes chameleon.
Droid loses chameleon, chameleon becomes blob, droid gets blob back
again.  It's a classic tale.  --Kryten, Red Dwarf
