<PRE>Greetings, Geminauts!

I had been planning something like this for a while, but the recent
announcement of the &quot;Send the nukes&quot; gemlog prompted me to get off my
butt and actually churn it out.

I am happy to announce that a tool named Gemfeed
(<A HREF="https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/gemfeed">https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/gemfeed</A>) is now ready for preliminary
testing.  Gemfeed's job is to create a single XML file containing an
Atom feed for all the .gmi or .gemini files in a single directory,
except the index.gmi/index.gemini file, if it exists.  It's designed
to be a very easy solution for a simple gemlog which is just a bunch
of .gmi files in a directory, especially when you are using the newly
specced heading line syntax (where h1, h2 and h3 level headings are
lines beginning with #, ## and ###).  You can either run it manually
after each post, or just set a cronjob to run it regularly enough and
then forget about it.  There are options to override the following
behaviour, but by default it uses the first heading it finds in the
index file as the feed's title, and uses the first heading it finds in
every non-index file as the title of an entry in the feed.  Each
entry's update time is set to the corresponding file's creation time
(not modification time, so you can fix minor typos the day after
without your feed changing).  Basically, if you are using headings in
a sensible way, all you need to tell Gemfeed is the URL corresponding
to the directory you're creating a feed for, and it will produce
something sensible.

Full instructions at
<A HREF="https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/gemfeed/src/branch/master/README.md.">https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/gemfeed/src/branch/master/README.md.</A>

If you have any kind of periodically updated Gemini content, please
give this a try!  I now plan to immediately begin work on a public
aggregator named CAPCOM (it will be both a tool you can use for your
own aggregation, like moku-pona, and a high-profile public aggregator,
like Bongusta), so the incentive for adopting Gemfeed is that you'll
be able to get your content aggregated there from the earliest days.
Stay tuned!

Cheers,
Solderpunk
