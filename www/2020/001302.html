</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Secondly, Linux systems come with iconv.  Not only is this a program, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's also a library which is dead simple to use as there are only three
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; functions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, i know these bindings and i know that libiconv is a thing. It's
</I>&gt;<i> still a dependency that *all* Gemini programs need to incorporate to be
</I>&gt;<i> *fully* compliant for displaying text/gemini files
</I>
  Yes, and because of the line breaking requirement of text/gemini, the
Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm is *also* required---a nice document of
20,000 words:

	<A HREF="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/">https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/</A>

  Your client does implement that, right?  Also, what does your client do if
it receives a BOM (byte order mark)?  That's illegal in UTF-8.  Also, what
Unicode normalization forms does it support?  What does it do when it
encounters an illegal byte in the document?

  Or does it pass everything along to the operating system?

&gt;<i> &gt;   RFC-1436 (the gopher RFC) suggests ISO Latin1 (ISO-8859-1 if I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mistaken) for 8-bit character sets and says *nothing* about UTF-8 (of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; course, it was written before UTF-8 was an RFC, three years later).  But
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most of the gopher sites I hit these days are UTF-8---it's rare that I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actually encounter anything but UTF-8.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, what you are saying is:
</I>&gt;<i> Most people already use utf-8, so there's no reason to enforce utf-8?
</I>
  Yes.

&gt;<i> I think it's even more an argument to enforce UTF-8. It makes the
</I>&gt;<i> software way simpler and less error pronce, reducing the possibilities
</I>&gt;<i> of attacks via badly implemented encodings and also reduces the risk of
</I>&gt;<i> il-translated and badly displayed text.
</I>
  I don't agree fully, given some of my questions above.  Also, do you
filter out control sequences?  MS-DOS supported control sequences to
redefine the keyboard but I'm not sure if that is still the case with
Windows.
