</I>&gt;<i> think it would also be suitable to change the name from &quot;alt text&quot; to
</I>&gt;<i> something like &quot;accessibile description&#8221;.
</I>
I think you&#8217;ve got the terminology backwards. In HTML, `alt` is for people who can&#8217;t see the image (didn&#8217;t download it, eyes don&#8217;t work right, etc.). In that light, renaming it to &#8220;accessible description&#8221; changes nothing, and &#8220;it should behave like the &#8217;title&#8217; attribute&#8221; means, as far as I can tell, &#8220;it should be accessory information for people who can already see the image&#8221;, which is not even _trying_ to be helpful for people who can&#8217;t see the image.

Let me show an example where the contents of `alt` and `title` differ wildly:

&lt;img src='conned-eventually.jpeg' alt='Chio telling Link &#8220;Ya know, if you keep doing everything everyone asks of you without question, you&#8217;re gonna get conned eventually&#8230;&#8221;' title='Little does Chio know I&#8217;ve already met Purah.'&gt;

The alt text describes the image (a screenshot of me playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild).

The title text is a joke, hidden behind a tooltip in most browsers, that should make anyone who&#8217;s played BotW snicker briefly. (Purah treats Link as an errand-boy for a good portion of the game.)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (You might be thinking &#8220;well, what about that Markdown meme where
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> people write &#8216;```javascript&#8217; to start off a JavaScript code block, with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the idea that a syntax highlighter will read it and colorize the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> output?&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The original point of suggesting that it be displayed for all users was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to discourage turning text intended for humans into text intended for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> machines anyways, but I believe an alternate solution other than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> displaying it for everybody would still be preferable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yep, that is what I meant, to drop machine-readability in favor of human
</I>&gt;<i> readability.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Rewriting that portion of the spec to emphasize that it is not to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parsed in any way other than as natural language?  Maybe say that a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client *should be able to* completely replace the preformatted block
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the contents of the alt text without the document losing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> significant meaning? That would work for ascii art and short code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> snippets, but it might not be doable for longer code blocks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An accessible description for a long code block seems like a non-goal,
</I>&gt;<i> though, because when code is text, I imagine that makes it accessible to
</I>&gt;<i> a screen reader.
</I>
I have a strong prior that most screen readers won&#8217;t read code text aloud in ways that would make sense to a (blind) programmer who&#8217;s familiar with that sort of code. For example, I would expect that most screen readers won&#8217;t read parentheses and single/double quotation marks out loud, and those sorts of punctuation marks tend to be superlatively important in roughly all programming languages.

And then there are blind non-programmers who might stumble across a bit of code, or blind programmers who don&#8217;t understand _that_ kind of code and would appreciate some short alternative text explaining what it does (this gives them a better idea of whether they should tough it out and listen to it all or just skip it).

&gt;<i> When considering these details it is helping me to draw a clear line
</I>&gt;<i> between an accessible content description and a caption. I think we want
</I>&gt;<i> the former, not the latter.
</I>
For what it&#8217;s worth, I&#8217;m pro-alt-text. Tightly-bound captions might also be nice (I&#8217;d use them if they were in the spec), but they&#8217;re much, _much_ less important.
