Lower your expectations, this probably wont replace the web, but I
hope it does one day.

</I>&gt;<i> For equations, I usually use MathJax. Talk about bloating!!!

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> what about a matrix or a more involved code?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What about data? The only thing that comes to me now is to

I get it... You're confused, Gemini is a protocol, not a document
format, gemtext (text/gemini) is the document format used by default
within the Gemini protocol, but there's nothing stopping you from
serving LaTeX formatted PDFs through Gemini, or for that matter, any
format.

&gt;<i> 4) What about musicians, or artists? I am not talking about
</I>&gt;<i> music score, which even in html has never been offered a nice
</I>&gt;<i> solution (that I know of). But audio? Is it possible to 
</I>&gt;<i> have audio? I mean, no need for the browser to play it, but
</I>&gt;<i> to link it? And what about artistic expression? As much as
</I>&gt;<i> I love plain text and black and white, many Sapiens consider
</I>&gt;<i> design and style a very important thing. Will these communities
</I>&gt;<i> feel excluded from gemini because of extreme (I like extreme)
</I>&gt;<i> simplicity? I am sure I still have a lot to learn here.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes I use ncurses just to have some nice colors in my
</I>&gt;<i> terminal. My question here is: is the style and design of
</I>&gt;<i> the page enforced by the protocol, the client or the page
</I>&gt;<i> itself? IMHO a plain text browser in which each page could
</I>&gt;<i> define background and text color would be really awesome.
</I>
Read the FAQ: <A HREF="gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/faq.gmi">gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/faq.gmi</A>
Gemtext is just a document format, styling is left for the client to
decide, stylesheets are not a thing here, unless you want to use Gemini
to serve HTML+CSS which you can do, but I wouldn't recommend.

For example, here's what Gemini looks like on my client:
<A HREF="https://ttm.sh/dt8.png,">https://ttm.sh/dt8.png,</A> this page could look totally different on
someone else's client, they decide how to style content displayed on
their client, not the author.

&gt;<i> 5) I love design and colors, but most of all I love content,
</I>&gt;<i> and I think that gemini is a refocus on content. And I love
</I>&gt;<i> it, with or without colors, with or without math. But my dream?
</I>&gt;<i> A minimalistic browsing with page-defined colors and with
</I>&gt;<i> some easiness to integrate math and graphics with plain text.
</I>
No.
