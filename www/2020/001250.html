<PRE>Thanks. These responses and re-reading the spec clarified my initial
concern. Spec clearly states that transient certificates should not be
shared across domains. And there is no point using permanent certificates
across domains as it is assumed that these certificates have a special
meaning for specific domains.

I am still unclear as to what happens after a transient certificate has
been created. Should browser automatically use it for the page that
requested it and any other pages on that domain? I don&#8217;t see a good
solution here. Either certificate is sent only when server requests it,
which would double number of requests (assuming user stays in private
section of the site), or certificate is always sent, which adds overhead to
all requests. Should browser remember which pages need a certificate and
always use it for them?

And additionally, should browser ask user for every page that requires a
certificate if existing one can be used?

Thanks for replying to my earlier questions. I want to make sure that my
support for certificates doesn&#8217;t violate the spec or creates a bad user
experience.

</I>&gt;<i> transient certs is extremely clearly specced and this would fly in the

</I>&gt;<i> thing to do, but it's slightly less disasterous than the first option.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Client certificates should be handled in a very deliberate manner - the

</I>&gt;<i> being identified to some server(s).  It's an exceptional condition and
</I>&gt;<i> should never be automated or hidden from the user for the sake of
</I>&gt;<i> convenience.  Sharing a single certificate across domains isn't
</I>&gt;<i> something anybody should ever do lightly.
