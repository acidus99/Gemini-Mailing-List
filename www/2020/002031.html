This, and the rest of the paragraph, is correct as far as I know. I'd like to see
more discussion around the gemini write / titan protocol, so that we can get something
that people can agree on, and clients and servers can actually implement.

I've talked kensanata / Alex, who created CommunityWiki on IRC, and we've discussed how
he was experimenting and pushing things ahead, but I don't think I'm alone in saying that
there should definitely be more discussion, an official spec, Solderpunk chiming in, etc.

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that there's real code and stuff that works.

&gt;<i> Is there somewhere else (an IRC channel, another mailing list,
</I>&gt;<i> etc) where Titan development has been discussed?
</I>
There's #gemini on the tilde.chat IRC, some things have been discussed there, but
anything big will probably happen here.

Cheers,
makeworld
