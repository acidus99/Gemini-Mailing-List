<PRE>It was thus said that the Great solderpunk once stated:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, speccing any line ending as permissble, like HTML does, would
</I>&gt;<i> seemingly immediately render most clients out-of-spec.
</I>
  Please, *please*, *PLEASE* do not let this disuade you from making most
clients out of spec.  We have had to suffer terrible things because of this
thinking (like Makefiles and tabs---&quot;when I realized my mistake, there were
already 10 people using it&quot;).

&gt;<i> Specifying CR or CRLF but not LF would require the minimum amount of
</I>&gt;<i> rework, but it would be hard to justify this by anything other than
</I>&gt;<i> laziness. 
</I>
  And bizareness.  The last time I worked on any systems that used only CR
was back in the 80s.  Today everybody uses either CRLF (Windows) or LF
(Linux, Mac OS-X, whatever remaining bits of Unix are still around).

&gt;<i> We basically need to choose between forcing server authors to normalise
</I>&gt;<i> all endings to CRLF or forcing client authors to recgonise LF (even
</I>&gt;<i> though it'll probably never be seen in the wild).
</I>
  Would that be only for text/gemini?  Or all of the text/* formats?
