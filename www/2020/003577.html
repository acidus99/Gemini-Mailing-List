<PRE>This conversation is getting away from Gemini, so I'm going to wrap it up here and let us agree to disagree.

&gt;<i> First of all, lets not conflate a spec with law. The spec

</I>
Okay but if you wanted something for the law being broken (i.e; your copyright being infringed), you have to go in front of a court of law.

&gt;<i> Secondly, let's actually look at what the court ruled here, on the implied license front:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consent to use the copyrighted work need not be manifested verbally and may be inferred based on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> silence where the copyright holder knows of the use and encourages it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Notice the &quot;where the copyright holder knows of the use and encourages it.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> That's not necessarily the case in this discussion. It was the case in that court case.
</I>&gt;<i> That court case literally doesn't apply here. Especially since Field explicitly added code
</I>&gt;<i> so that search engines would index *the URL* of the page. This is not the case in this discussion
</I>&gt;<i> as the
</I>&gt;<i> absence of robots.txt would *not* be explicitly allowing search engines to index the URL of the
</I>&gt;<i> page, and each
</I>&gt;<i> server that doesn't have a robots.txt would not &quot;know of the use and encourage it&quot;.
</I>
I don't know where you got the idea that Field added code to make the engine index the URL-- that's what a search engine does-- but I don't care at this point.

&gt;<i> Finally, precedents can be challenged by the Supreme Court. For example, the current Supreme Court
</I>&gt;<i> case of Google v. Oracle dismissed everything the district courts and the Circuits had to say,
</I>&gt;<i> because the Supreme Court looks at things freshly.
</I>
Google v Oracle is an *ongoing* case. No precedent was set, because the case never actually came to rest. See the EFF's page on it:

<A HREF="https://www.eff.org/cases/oracle-v-google">https://www.eff.org/cases/oracle-v-google</A>

Just my two cents,
