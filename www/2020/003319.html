&gt;<i> I stumbled over Gemini a while ago and today tried to setup my first
</I>&gt;<i> blog post.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I take issue with the fact that a paragraph has to be one long line. I
</I>&gt;<i> think the markdown way is perfect: Two newlines create a paragraph.
</I>&gt;<i> Period. This way, everyone can write maintaining the common width of 80
</I>&gt;<i> characters, and it will still be displayed as intended.
</I>
I think the reason for this choice is due to the fact that in
text/gemini you have different kinds of lines: paragraphs, links,
quotations, items and the ``` marker to switch to verbatim.  If you add
a rule to &#8220;join&#8221; sequential non-blank &#8220;simple&#8221; lines into one paragraph,
it can cause weird effects.

Let&#8217;s say you change some text in the paragraph and you reformat it:
your editor may decide to break a long line so that the next now starts
with a &#8216;*&#8217; or with a &#8216;&gt;&#8217;&#8230;  You can change the gemtext spec again so that
items and quotation needs a blank line before but&#8230; is ugly, isn&#8217;t it?

(this point is also aggravated by the fact that it isn&#8217;t clear if a
space after &#8216;*&#8216;, &#8216;=&gt;&#8217; etc. is required or not, so clients can misbehave,
at least in theory)

I am not a fan of long lines and visual folding either, but it simplify
the syntax (good for parsers) and makes it difficult *for humans* to
introduce errors in their documents.

&gt;<i> For the first time in a long while I started to search neovim's help to
</I>&gt;<i> find out if there's any way to have long lines and still work with them
</I>&gt;<i> productively. Softwrap on or off doesn't do the trick, it's rather
</I>&gt;<i> annoying when you want to edit something in the mid of a huge
</I>&gt;<i> paragraph. `30w cw`...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My life would be more easy if I could just do what I always did and
</I>&gt;<i> wrap at 80. Considering Gemini will mostly target software people, I
</I>&gt;<i> think that's appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But if anyone here can provide me with a clever (neovim) trick to deal
</I>&gt;<i> with these long lines, I'm open to hear about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
