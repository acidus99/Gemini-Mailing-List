I fully agree that the expiration date is useless in TOFU schemes. I brought
this up on the mailing list a while ago and I didn't see any rebuttals that
really convinced me otherwise. The mailing list settled on recommending a
long
expiration times of several years, but that was just dodging the fundamental
problem IMO. I think it will still take folks a while to come around to this
conclusion. Thank you for giving me some hope :)

I didn't make the logical jump at the time, but certificate hostnames are
similarly useless in TOFU for the same reason. They don't verify anything
since
they can be trivially forged.

The expiration date does not protect against anything in this scenario. An
attacker can trivially generate a new certificate to send to the client if
they see the old one has expired.

Now you're talking about CA verified certificates. There's nothing wrong
with
using self-signed CAs, but it's a completely different security model than
TOFU and shouldn't be confused with it.
