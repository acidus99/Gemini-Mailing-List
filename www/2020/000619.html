I actually really like this idea. I previously had thought a literal alt text there as well. But differentiating crawlable content seems useful. It could also tell screen readers whether or not to attempt to read the content or not.

I propose, also very hesitantly, that the following be optional elements to code fences:
- The opening fence can be followed by a flag value of text or art (or some other words that get decided upon, maybe even a or t)
- The closing fence can be followed by alt text

```art
8-)
``` Googly eyed smiley face

```text
I am
   a short thing
with      literal      spacing
```

Alt text may or may not be needed for a text style fence but an art one almost certainly could benefit from it. A system like this would give clients and users the ability to communicate things based on user preference (ie. a screen reader user only wanting alt text for art with no attempt to read the actual content in the fence, or a different user only wanting the content but not the alt).


Anyway, interesting ideas.
