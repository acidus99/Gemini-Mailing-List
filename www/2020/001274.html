<PRE>Another voice over here in against any suggestion to drop the frugal but useful heading and bullet structuring we have already.

Having already implemented automatic table of contents in GemiNaut I can confirm it does give a usability boost when reading longer posts. 

It is very lightweight and zero burden for anyone who just wants to write a long essay. 

I think the current spec has it right.

Utf 8 everywhere sounds good as a working principle. Maybe we can wait and see if there really is a widespread need for any other encodings.

We can do ASCII art in Unicode - I don't get what the drive behind that remark was, mentioned earlier.

As for TLS versions, I don't have a strong opinion, except to say that implementing the normal case for the majority of content should be straightforward on the client and server side. Keep the complexity down as far as we can.

Best wishes

Luke
