Okay, I rediscovered the page I was looking for: &lt;
<A HREF="https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/71377/how-to-properly-disallow-the-archive-org-bot-did-things-change-if-so-when/">https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/71377/how-to-properly-disallow-the-archive-org-bot-did-things-change-if-so-when/</A>
&gt;<i>.

Search on that page for &quot;random item on eBay&quot;.  This test shows that as of
May 2017, the IA was supporting robots.txt.  I tried this myself, and it
shows three crawls, two in 2019 and one in 2020, that agree with what you
see (&quot;Unknown item&quot;) if you follow the direct link.  This agrees with the
claim that robots.txt was turned off in 2018 for all sites; however,
apparently the IA is not announcing this.  My guess (only a guess) is that
IA thinks that people who don't want to be archived will start using less
reliable mechanisms like blocking IP addresses.

Now search farther down the page for &quot;just did a quick test&quot;.  This shows
that as of March 2017 the IA was refusing to display pages put off-limits
by robots.txt, consistently with the above.  However, when the robots.txt
entry was removed, crawls from 2010 through 2017 suddenly appeared!  So
even in the pre-2018 regime, the IA was crawling the pages but hiding them.

If I have seen farther than others, it is because I was looking through a
spyglass with my one good eye, with a parrot standing on my shoulder. --&quot;Y&quot;
