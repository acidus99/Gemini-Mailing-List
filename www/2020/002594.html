&gt;<i> I think it would be helpful to quote the spec here:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Use of alt text is at the client's discretion, and simple clients may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ignore it. Alt text is recommended for ASCII art or similar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-textual content which, for example, cannot be meaningfully
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understood when rendered through a screen reader or usefully indexed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by a search engine. Alt text may also be used for computer source code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to identify the programming language which advanced clients may use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for syntax highlighting.
</I>&gt;<i> Alt text is recommended for, and I think named after, the role of alt
</I>&gt;<i> text in HTML&lt;img&gt;. That is, to be an alternative representation of the
</I>&gt;<i> content, like &quot;Photograph of a woman on a horse&quot;. In that sense it is
</I>&gt;<i> meant to be text that users see! Just not every user in all
</I>&gt;<i> circumstances. HTML&lt;img&gt;  alt text is meant in part for users that use
</I>&gt;<i> screen readers, but users nonetheless. So I would prefer we not go
</I>&gt;<i> adding extensions to alt text that prevent it from being always
</I>&gt;<i> human-readable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Refer to the alt attribute as documented here:)
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Img">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Img</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The advanced use case cited in the spec matches the way in
</I>&gt;<i> GitHub-flavored Markdown you can write ```typescript to get TypeScript
</I>&gt;<i> syntax highlighting. While not an alternative content representation,
</I>&gt;<i> that is at least human-readable.
</I>
Whilst a reference to the HTML spec is interesting, we are defining 
Gemini here, so the Gemini spec isn't beholden to HTML.

The spec mentions both applications of the tail of the &quot;mode switch 
line&quot; (to avoid a normative gloss), both as an alt text and to identify 
the programming language. So this duality is already envisaged in the spec.

&gt;<i> Really, I think what we have here is a field with two possible uses that
</I>&gt;<i> are at cross purposes, one for people and one for machines. Syntatically
</I>&gt;<i> it's based on something in Markdown that's for machine use, but it's
</I>&gt;<i> recommended for the human use. But the whole idea of it being for human
</I>&gt;<i> use is spoiled by the fact that it will grate on humans in cases when it
</I>&gt;<i> is not for their use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would rather the spec either make a call and pick one purpose, or omit
</I>&gt;<i> the field entirely, rather than leaving this conflict unresolved.
</I>
I prefer that the spec allows for multiple uses. Primarily it is a label 
for human benefit, but that is not to say it cannot be comprehended by a 
machine.

This sort of relates to the other thread on the ML right now - about 
whether there could be a feed format based on gemtext - it would be 
based on certain conventions in the use of the format, without breaking 
gemtext at all.

I don't see how the spec can mandate the content that is in an 
informative part of the content -i.e. a label on an element.
