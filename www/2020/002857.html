<PRE>Hi all,

I have a few topics concerning crawling geminispace that I would like to bring
up.

First, I have recently updated my web proxy @ <A HREF="https://portal.mozz.us">https://portal.mozz.us</A> to respect
robots.txt files placed at the root of a gemini capsule. The proxy will follow
rules for either the &quot;webproxy&quot; or &quot;webproxy-mozz&quot; user agents. My feelings
have gone back and forth on this point because I'm not convinced that a web
proxy falls into the category of a &quot;crawler&quot;; it's a network client that makes
requests on behalf of real users. Nonetheless, geminispace has been growing and
I have started to see links to gemlog articles via proxy show up on twitter and
the typical tech discussion boards. This clashing of communities makes me
nervous on a personal level so I want to give folks a chance to opt-out of it,
at least for my proxy.

Second, I have *slowly* been building a crawler for gemini [0]. My goal is to
create a historical archive of geminispace and submit it somewhere for
long-term preservation. This was inspired by Charles Lehner's recent email to
the list [0]. I've spent a fair amount of time in gopher, and I am deeply
saddened that so many of the important gopher servers from the 90's have been
lost forever. Currently my crawler is respecting robots.txt files using the
&quot;mozz-archiver&quot; user agent. I will probably standardize this to match my proxy
(i.e. &quot;archiver&quot; and &quot;archiver-mozz&quot;). I am not 100% decided that I will even
respect robots files for this project (archive.org doesn't [2]), but right now
I'm leaning towards &quot;yes&quot;. If you are currently mirroring a large website like
wikipedia over gemini, I would greatly appreciate if you setup a robots.txt to
block one of the above user-agents from those paths to make my life a bit
easier.

best,
mozz
