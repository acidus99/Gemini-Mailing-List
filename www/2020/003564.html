<PRE>Hi Krixano,

A few thoughts. First of all, please use plaintext email in future
(<A HREF="https://useplaintext.email/#protonmail,">https://useplaintext.email/#protonmail,</A> as your signature clearly indicated you use protonmail I
can give you the direct link). It's easier for a lot of us to access.

Regarding your first email:

</I>
It may be a leap of logic, sure, but it's the same leap of logic that has been all but codified as
law (see court cases like Field v. Google, where judges have determined that not including a
robots.txt or no-archive tag grants an implied license to archive). As stated in the case summary of Field v. Google:

&gt;<i> Author granted operator of Internet search engine implied license to display &quot;cached&quot; links to web pages containing his copyrighted works when author consciously chose not to include no-archive meta-tag on pages of his website, despite knowing that including meta-tag would have informed operator not to display &quot;cached&quot; links to his pages and that absence of meta-tag would be interpreted by operator as permission to allow access to his web pages via &quot;cached&quot; links.
</I>
Google's &quot;cached&quot; pages system is essentially an archive under a different name. Is it truly a leap of logic if even a court of law comes to the same decision?

</I>
It is an appeal to authority, but not a fallacious one. The Internet Archive is (as far as I know)
the biggest archiving group on the Internet. If they do something, it's not entirely beyond reason
to assume other people do the same. A wide variety of people who do archiving that I've spoken to
have the same attitude: they'll still archive it, but they won't make the archive available to the
public if they aren't supposed to.

</I>
Again, see above; the law is on the side of the person assuming robots.txt is a system for opting out of indexing/archiving/etc. 

Just my two cents,
