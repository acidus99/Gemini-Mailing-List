<PRE>I think there have been a lot of good suggestions coming from all sides. Here's
my take on a compromised format that tries to take everything into account while
also inserting a few of my own opinions:

Parser pseudo-code (actually, it's valid python):

```
preformat_mode = False
preformat_buffer = []
for line in document:
    if line.startswith('```'):
        if not preformat_mode:
            # Start preformat block
            preformat_mode = True
            preformat_buffer = []
        else:
            # End preformat block
            preformat_mode = False
            display_preformat_block(preformat_buffer)
    elif preformat_mode:
        # Inside of preformat block
        preformat_buffer.append(line)
    elif line.startswith('###'):
        display_header_level_3(line)
    elif line.startswith('##'):
        display_header_level_2(line)
    elif line.startswith('#'):
        display_header_level_1(line)
    elif line.startswith('=&gt;'):
        display_link(line)
    elif line.startswith('---'):
        display_horizontal_rule()
    else:
        display_paragraph(line)

if preformat_mode:
    # Flush the preformat block if there was no end tag
    add_preformat_block(preformat_buffer)
```

This pseudo-code was written with &quot;fancy&quot; gemini clients in mind. In other
words, this should be close to the worst-case scenario for how complicated a
gemini document parser would ever need to be.

## Preformat mode

Many clients are going to want to display a preformat block of text in a
horizontally scrollable window or some other type of block widget. This
pseudo-code reflects that by sticking the pre-formatted lines in a separate
buffer until the end of the block. I think this is a more accurate
representation of what most client parsers would end up looking like.

## Headers

I'm of the opinion that there should only be a fixed number of header levels.
It keeps the matching logic flat and straightforward. Three levels is few
enough that most clients should be able to come up with distinct styles to
display them. Fixed header lines are trivial to parse and provide a lot of
utility for organizing a document and linking to sub-sections.

### Ordered Lists &amp; Unordered Lists

Lists are tricky because while they would be nice to have, the complicate the
parsing significantly. In order to parse a list while preserving its semantic
structure, you will need to keep track of where it starts and ends. Nested
lists complicate this even further, no matter which syntax for nesting is used.

Parsing lists semantically would require keeping a separate buffer for each type
of list, and then keeping flags and making sure that these buffers are flushed
after the last element in the list. Because of this, I do not believe that they
pass the power-to-weight ratio smell test.

For authors, they still have a few choices for lists:

1. Stick the list in a preformat block
2. Write the list in plain mode without special formatting

I accept that neither of these options is *ideal* for all use cases, but I
think they are *good enough* for most use cases. Don't forget that unicode
bullets can already be added directly in gemini documents if the author
wishes to do so.

### Quotes

Quote blocks with &quot;&gt;&quot; would be ok if we could count on them being only a single
line long. However, many quotes will necessarily include line breaks that
should be displayed together in a single block. This complicates parsing in the
same way that lists do, so I think that quotes should also be omitted for the
same reason.

If you want to display something like a quote from a mailing list message, I
think that would be a perfect candidate for copying it into a preformat
block. For other types of quotes, stick them between two horizontal rules to
separate them from the surrounding text.

### Horizontal Rule

I find the horizontal rule useful for separating sections of a page. I see them
commonly use on gopher to add a footer to the bottom. They can likewise be
used for header sections.

```
Header
---
Content
---
Footer
```

The following gemini sites already use some form of horizontal separator on
their front pages (the precise syntax varies):

- <A HREF="gemini://vger.cloud/">gemini://vger.cloud/</A>
- <A HREF="gemini://gemini.conman.org/">gemini://gemini.conman.org/</A>
- <A HREF="gemini://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/">gemini://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/</A>
- <A HREF="gemini://carcosa.net/">gemini://carcosa.net/</A>
- <A HREF="gemini://yam655.com/">gemini://yam655.com/</A>

I think that since horizontal rules are easy to parse and they add utility for
structuring pages, they should be included in the spec.

### Other Random Opinions

- Leading and trailing whitespace should be stripped from all of lines outside
  of the preformat block. If you're allowing a non-monospace font for these
  elements, then leading whitespace can look inconsistent and trailing
  whitespace serves no real purpose. By leading whitespace, I mean that

##     heading text

  Should be interpreted as &quot;heading text&quot;, not &quot;     heading text&quot;.
- I have no opinion on whether the ``` should allow text after it on the same
  line.

I think I would be satisfied enough with the above document to at least try it
out by converting all of my existing gemini content. I also think I would be
fine keeping everything fixed-width and hard wrapping. I *don't* think I would
want to implement nested lists or quote blocks, or anything significantly more
complicated than what is outlined above.
