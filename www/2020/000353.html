Ah, yes, Tomasino mentioned this earlier.

I guess it is harmless (?) to change the definition of these lines to
any which begin with ```, not which consist strictly of ```.  That lets
sufficiently fancy clients support this, the rest can just ignore it.
These lines are never actually shown to the user, so it doesn't matter
what junk comes after the ```.

&gt;<i> If not, what would happen if people add text to the closing three ticks?
</I>
Well, that's unambiguous.  If we didn't make the above change, lines with
text after the three ticks would not meet the definition of a preformatted
toggle line, so a client would identify them as a text line and they would
be rendered accordingly.

&gt;<i> &gt; Lines longer than the client's viewport must not be wrapped, leading or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trailing whitespace must not be removed, etc.  Handling of lines longer than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the viewport is client-specific
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These two sentences contradict each other, I think.
</I>
Hmm, okay, I guess they technically do.  Clients can handle over-long
lines however they want as long as they don't wrap them?

&gt;<i> Are minus signs allowed for unordered list items? How about plus signs etc?
</I>&gt;<i> I'm somewhat in favor of limiting bullets to astrisks and minuses.
</I>
I'm fairly strongly in favour of limiting everything to exactly one way
of doing it.  The other day I skimmed the CommonMark spec
<A HREF="https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/">https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/</A> to reassure myself we weren't doing
too much wheel re-invention.  Holy heck, there are so many different
ways to do everything!  Simple is best, less is more, one is enough!
 
&gt;<i> Can top-level bullets begin with a space? What about nested bullet points?
</I>
If a line begins with a space, then it doesn't begin with a *!  So then
it's by definition not an UNORDERED LIST ITEM.  It's a TEXT LINE.  I
really did mean &quot;begins with&quot; everywhere I said it.  IMHO this syntax
quickly becomes really unappealing unless the task of deciding which
type of line a line is remains dirt simple.

Yes, this means no nested lists.  It may seem like I've gone nuts and
suddenly happily let a whole bunch of complicated stuff into the spec,
but I really haven't!  This is still supposed to be a very simple
syntax, which inevitably comes with limitations.  There is no nested
anything in the whole syntax.  Reliable detection of nestedness in the
face of even slight variation in how authors write things will require
considering lines in the context of previous or subsequent lines, and
that's a no-no here.  I'm only willing to allow all these fun toys in if
we can do it in such a way that an adequate rendering job can be done by
considering each line of the file in perfect isolation, with a single
pass of the entire document.

&gt;<i> &gt; 7. ORDERED LIST ITEMS
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd further specify what is/isn't allowed here. For example:
</I>&gt;<i> - Some people may try `1)` instead of `1.`. I personally think that spec should
</I>&gt;<i>   say that only the latter is allowed but clients may choose to *render*
</I>&gt;<i>   ordered lists as the former
</I>&gt;<i> - What about nested ordered bullet points. Wouldn't they start with whitespace?
</I>&gt;<i> - Markdown allows lists to be auto-numbered. For example, the nested bullet
</I>&gt;<i>   points would be re-numbered from 1 to 5 in markdown:
</I>&gt;<i>   1. one
</I>&gt;<i>   1. two
</I>&gt;<i>   5. three
</I>&gt;<i>   2. four
</I>&gt;<i>   1. five
</I>&gt;<i> - What about lettered lists (A-Z)? I think these would be cool to have but I
</I>&gt;<i>   doubt they'd be worth the complexity. I'd be explicit in the spec
</I>&gt;<i> - What about roman numerals? I don't think these should be allowed
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While we could leave some stuff un-specified and see how things play out, I
</I>&gt;<i> think there could be some value in limiting authors for the sake of preventing
</I>&gt;<i> a scenario where making a client is so complex that very few nice clients exist
</I>&gt;<i> (as we see in the world of web browsers).
</I>
Okay, I totally goofed up here in declaring the changes as &quot;obvious&quot;.  I
meant &quot;obvious to everybody who has read
<A HREF="gemini://mozz.us/markdown/design_document">gemini://mozz.us/markdown/design_document</A> and accepted is as their
personal Lord and saviour&quot;.  Well, actually, I read that and foolishly
assumed the nice approach to ordered list items was more or less the
same as standard Markdown.  Turns out it's not and Michael has done very
good simplifying work here.

As said above, I am strongly in favour of there being exactly one way to
do things, and of identifying a line's type being brutally simple.  This
totally rules out letting authors actually write numbers.  Actually
having a number followed by a period define such a line type would also
bring a very high risk of falsely identifying ordered list item lines
when processing hard-wrapped text if a sentence ending in a number, like
&quot;Ten Gemini crews flew low Earth orbit (LEO) missions during 1965 and
1966.&quot; was wrapped in such a way that the final word was at the start of
a line.  Yes, I know, this new syntax works best when there is no hard
wrapping, so that we can use lines to determine the scope of certain
kinds of &quot;specialness&quot;, but I will be VERY HAPPY if we can make the
syntax robust enough that it can still be applied to rare instances of
hard-wrapped content without much going wrong.

So, lines beginning with a + (not any whitespace, but a +!) are ORDERED
LIST ITEM lines.  Clients who want to be fancy can add a little bit of
extra internal state to their rendering code and can replace the +s with
incrementing numbers.  It's the client's choice whether it uses 1. 2. 3.
or 1) 2) 3) or i&gt; ii&gt; iii&gt; or whatever else.  Very fancy clients can let
the user decide.  Yes, this means content authors lose precise control
over how their content is rendered (while retaining precise control over
the *semantics* of their content, i.e. authors decide whether an item is
ordered or not).  I'm not just okay with this, I'm actively happy about
it.  The web paradigm where readers are subordinate to authors with
regards to layout is a cause of many different kinds of grief.  Good
riddace to it!
 
&gt;<i> Hmm, I only saw 7 different types specified.
</I>
Okay, turns out I can't count in a hurry. :)  I actually just wrote N
when I first wrote that sentence, then when I ran out of time to sketch
this thing out I went back, did a quick, incorrect count, and changed
it.  In the actual spec I'll double check, and the number will be
whatever it is - I didn't mean for the list I sent out to be exhaustive,
although I also think we should resist the urge to add every nice little
thing we can think of.  It'd be great if we kept the total number to 10
or less.

&gt;<i> I also recommend you specify that
</I>&gt;<i> people may use greater-than-symbol quotes, which may be nested.
</I>
I have no problem with quotes, but I'm not thrilled by the nesting
prospect.

&gt;<i> that authors MUST NOT unnecessarily hard-wrap their quotes, suggesting that
</I>&gt;<i> advanced clients MAY add a visual greater-than symbol to the beginning of each
</I>&gt;<i> wrapped line.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hello this is wider than the viewport
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Displayed by advanced clients as:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hello this is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wider that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; viewport
</I>
This is exactly how I'd expect advanced clients to handle this, and I
think this whole idea is implicit in the design of this syntax: the
start of a line indicates what kind of line it is, and the scope of that
type is precisely that line.  A hard-wrapped quote with a &gt; at the start
of each line is, in this syntax, actually several distinct consecutive
quotes.
 
&gt;<i> What about Gemini proxies of comment thread sites, such as hacker news (*waves
</I>&gt;<i> to Michael Lazar's awesome HN Gopher proxy*). I think we should take those
</I>&gt;<i> into consideration.
</I>
Hmm.  I would want to think a bit before I lay down a hard statement on
this because I don't want to impose too much of my own ideology on
Gemini, as it's supposed to be a general-purpose tool....but I am not
excited by verbatim dragging of mainstream web 2.0 cultural concepts
like comment threads into Gemini.  The circle of Gemini early-adopters
overlaps considerably with the &quot;Small Internet&quot; / &quot;Slow Internet&quot;
movement, which I guess has coloured how I think about the protocol.
Thus the idea of adding something into the spec specifically to support
visualising deep comment threads in the web-conventional way kind of
gives me the heebie-jeebies.
