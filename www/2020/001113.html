Nope, I think it's a nice addition and not a bad idea at all! Low
extensibility, high value for the two use cases you described (screen
readers and search engines).

Agreed.

Agreed.

I agree with this in principle (i.e., as a guidepost for good user
experience in a search engine), but there can be complicating factors
in practice. In particular, some common and generally effective text
indexing processes involve things like porter stemming words (so
&quot;stemmed&quot; and &quot;stemming&quot; would both get indexed as something like
&quot;stem&quot;) and removal of &quot;stop words&quot; (and, in, the...). As you might
imagine, both of these operations are specific to language.

So, simply in creating an index of Geminispace, there might already be
an assumed &quot;default&quot; language. In the case of GUS, this is English. I
don't stop GUS from indexing any non-English content currently, but
the quality of indexing is lower for other languages. Operations like
the above (porter stemming and removing stop words) will simply be
no-ops.

And then the other side of this experience is that when a user types
in a search query, that also goes through the same process - the query
is porter stemmed, stripped of its stop words, then shuttled off to
the TF-IDF index to find and score the actual matches.

For what its worth, I do not believe any of what I've written here is
an argument for adding a default language to the spec. That, to me,
feels solidly outside the appropriate scope of the spec. But, if we're
talking search engines, there's probably going to end up being a
default language in practice for any search engine based on mainstream
full-text search approaches.

Agreed! I think the power-to-weight ratio of a line-specific lang
value is too low. Allowing multiple lang values at the document level
feels like a nice balance though.

What does directionality mean in this context?

In terms of how the above all sounds:
- I support the addition of the document-level lang parameter, which
  can accept multiple values, to the spec.
- I do NOT support the addition of a default document-level lang value
  to the spec.
- I do NOT support the addition of a line-level lang parameter.
