<PRE>I'm building a lib to simplify gemini client development in python,
and my current headache is certification handling. There's a few
things that come to mind, some more philosophical than technical in
nature.

* Should I support verification of CA-issued certificates, or
self-signed only? Doing both at the same time leads to a &quot;try this, if
fail then try this&quot; sort of situation which isn't very pretty. How
common are CA-issued certificates in geminispace, and should they be
handled differently than TOFU?
* How does one even validate a self-signed cert? If ew0k.example.com
serves a certificate with the Common Name &quot;ew0k's Awesome Site&quot; and no
Subject Alternative Names, is that less valid than one that includes
the hostname? Or the IP? Does expiration time matter at all for a
self-signed cert?
* When a browser has accepted one cert for example.com but is
presented another on the next visit, it shows a warning to the user
who will then decide whether to accept the new cert. What information
allows a user to make an informed decision in this case? Does it
matter that the last cert would still be valid for another 3 years? Or
2 months?

Any opinions or advice welcomed :)

Cheers,
ew0k
