<PRE>I think this proposal misunderstands the utility of the Gemini protocol, though I may myself be mistaken.

The web itself shouldn&#8217;t have become a widget library, or a set of applications. The DOM is a poor replacement for something like GTK, et al., and HTML/JS/CSS has come pretty far in approximating it to an operating system by punting an operating system level of complexity to the client &#8212; thus web browsers are unmaintainable by anyone other than corporations who can build an operating system to a specification.

In this regard, I think protocols like <A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> or <A HREF="gopher://">gopher://</A> aren&#8217;t meant to *supplant* the web, but have a specialised purpose. There can be a very small, human scale specification. Let HTTP do what it&#8217;s become specialised to do; and in our own projects, abandon it. In doing so, you can avoid the incentives that brought clearnet where it is now.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you're absolutely right that the scope of the web (or more
</I>&gt;<i> specifically, the web browser) has grown to the point that it might
</I>&gt;<i> soon be impractical to make use of it without Google's tech (and you
</I>&gt;<i> only need to look at Android to see how that will play out, and Apple
</I>&gt;<i> are little better). On the other hand, I don't think Gemini is the
</I>&gt;<i> place to address this; as I see it, Gemini stands on its own, with its
</I>&gt;<i> own purpose, which does happen to align with the original purpose of
</I>&gt;<i> the web, and is perhaps why it seems the obvious to modify in the ways
</I>&gt;<i> you suggest (similar types of ideas crossed my mind too).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I personally think that the way to revive the web is to run HTTP on a
</I>&gt;<i> different port so that content can be identified as separate from the
</I>&gt;<i> current web, and where this implies a reduced level of functionality
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. content that can be rendered by Kristall, or Dillo, or Lynx,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.). I've put a lighttpd server on port 1993 of my Gemini server,
</I>&gt;<i> though I've had no reason to use it yet - I'm free to *not* use any
</I>&gt;<i> web features I don't want to. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well done on getting your C client running, if you're sharing the
</I>&gt;<i> code, I'd love to check it out!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The recent news about the layoffs at Mozilla have left me wondering as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to whether the modern web has become too complex. I've heard people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discuss the Gemini protocol as a simplified alternative that is way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easier to work with. After checking it out (and even trying to write a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> small experimental client in C, which thanks to libtls, ended up way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easier than I thought), it seems to be a really promising idea.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was thinking about an idea similar to Gemini that could work as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protocol for not just websites, but also simple and functional web
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applications as well that could, to a reasonable extent, look and work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well on lots of different devices (desktops, smartphones, feature
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> phones, text-mode interfaces). After seeing how the Gemini protocol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> works, it seems to me that a lot of these ideas could be implemented in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a backwards-compatible way or with minimal modifications to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protocol.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Basic form inputs / &quot;widgets&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In addition to an &quot;INPUT&quot; response that only requests a line of text and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> returns the question as a single line in the &lt;META&gt; field, some sort of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;extended input&quot; could be useful. It could still be restricted to a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> single query, but it could provide software-interpretable hints as to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what kind of input is preferable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example, a &quot;check&quot; input could provide a numbered list of options
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and then ask the user to submit a query consisting a list of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> numbered items the user wants to select (or 0 if none). A more advanced
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client program would then display the entire request as a series of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> checkboxes or switches that the user can toggle. A &quot;radio&quot; or &quot;button&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> input could demand a single number, and the client would display the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> items as a list of radio switches or buttons, of which only one can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> selected.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I can imagine the description of the inputs either being part of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;META&gt; field, part of the previous page's text or maybe an &quot;extended
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> input&quot; could have its own response body that they're written in.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or a &quot;date&quot; input could say that it expects a date in the YYYY-MM-DD
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> format, but an advanced client could provide the user with a date picker
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Either way, the general idea is that a simple client could just ask the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user to write the query as a line of text.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Continuous connections
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A user might want to not just give commands to a service, but also to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expect it to provide a continuous stream of information over a long
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> term. Most modern web pages use scripting to accomplish something like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that (and most web-browsers wait for a page to finish loading before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> displaying it), but a minimal version of this seems achievable without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> An additional response type (say, &quot;21 SUCCESS WITH CONTINUOUS RESPONSE&quot;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or mime-type (say, &quot;text/gemini-continuous&quot;) would indicate that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server will not give the entire response at once and then immediately
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> close the connection, but instead the connection will continue for a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> long time, and instead of waiting for the entire text to be received,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the client should look for whenever a complete line arrives and print
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that line.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The client could then use that connection to receive updates on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> request, until either the client or the server actually decides to close
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the connection or it gets closed by some other means.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Append mode
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is just a little extra feature, but the idea is that a page
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (probably also via mime-type, like &quot;text/gemini-append&quot;, or an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> additional parameter, like &quot;text/gemini; append&quot;) could indicate that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its contents should, if possible, be added at the end of the previous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page, rather than replacing it entirely.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ---
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would like to hear your opinions as to whether these ideas could, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should, be added to the Gemini protocol, and in which specific ways if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so. Thank you all very much.
