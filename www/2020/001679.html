</I>This is quite a harsh perspective IMO - in the developing world there

Whilst we might not build specifically for phone users, the light weight 
nature of Gemini does make it a potential vehicle to be used for many 
more people than we may imagine.

Perhaps in this phase of the definition of Gemini, we should think of a 
potential user as our &quot;significant others&quot;. Perhaps users who have an 
inclination to write and share their thoughts outside of the highly 
commercialised mainstream web. But certainly not an assumption they know 
what ssh, sftp or running your own linux server.

What would these users need to assist them?

Best Wishes
