<PRE>It was thus said that the Great <A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini">colecmac at protonmail.com</A> once stated:
&gt;<i> lel wrote:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [...] but no one had formalized anything about it yet [...]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This, and the rest of the paragraph, is correct as far as I know. I'd like to see
</I>&gt;<i> more discussion around the gemini write / titan protocol, so that we can get something
</I>&gt;<i> that people can agree on, and clients and servers can actually implement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've talked kensanata / Alex, who created CommunityWiki on IRC, and we've discussed how
</I>&gt;<i> he was experimenting and pushing things ahead, but I don't think I'm alone in saying that
</I>&gt;<i> there should definitely be more discussion, an official spec, Solderpunk chiming in, etc.
</I>
  Not to put words into solderpunk's mouth, but I suspect he'd stay out of
this conversation and as long as it isn't pushed as something that's
mandatory, he'd be fine with this.

  As per more discussion, Alex is basing his work off this message to the
list:

	<A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/001657.html">https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/001657.html</A>

with the slight change in that the path parameters are all separated by a
';', not a leading ';' and '&amp;' for the others, which, okay, I'm fine with
it.  So to update it a bit:

	<A HREF="titan://example.com/post-handler/endpoint?size=1234&amp;mime=text/plain">titan://example.com/post-handler/endpoint?size=1234&amp;mime=text/plain</A>
	<A HREF="titan://example.com/path/to/new/resource;size=1234;mime=text/plain">titan://example.com/path/to/new/resource;size=1234;mime=text/plain</A>
	<A HREF="titan://example.com/path/to/remove;size=0">titan://example.com/path/to/remove;size=0</A>

  The logic goes something like this [2]:

	if the request has a query, it's an upload of data---accept data.
	if the request has no query, and the path parameter (marked by ';')
		doesn't exist---error.
	if the request has no query, and the path parameter exists:
		if size==0, delete the resource
		if size&gt;0, accept data and make the resource available.

  The 'size' parameter is mandatory; the 'mime' parameter is mandatory for
non-delete requests, there may be other parameters that are specific to a
host or implementation.

  I was also thinking that a request like:

	<A HREF="titan://example.com/path/to/resource">titan://example.com/path/to/resource</A>

with no query string or path parameters, *might* return meta information
about the resource, like:

	size			(mandatory)
	MIME type		(mandatory)
	creation time		(optional)
	modification time	(mandatory)
	author			(optional)
	version			(optional)
	etc.			(other, optional fields)

  Just an idea.

&gt;<i> Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that there's real code and stuff that works.
</I>
  Same here.
