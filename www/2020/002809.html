<PRE>It's like my nan used to say - you hang around for ages waiting for a PHP
Gemini Server, then two come along at once. (in case you're wondering,
another PHP server was announced earlier today - who'd have thought).

I was curious about how PHP might give access to the client certificate,
and discovered this example that might be of use
<A HREF="https://freek.dev/530-validating-ssl-certificates-with-php">https://freek.dev/530-validating-ssl-certificates-with-php</A> - it seems based
on the stream socket approach that you also use, and if so it shows how to
get the X509 certificate that you can use to generate an SHA-256 signature.

In any case, thanks for sharing!  Are you currently running any sites on
this?
