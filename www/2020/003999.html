Correct, i meant  that this is a client issue  deriving from debatable
choices.

[OT] Nice! Do  yo have a preferred  dialect? I like Guile a  lot but i
fear i  end missing CLOS  (GOOPS is  not the same,  unfortunately) and
condition system.

I agree!  My only concerns is  i have the impression  that client that
will  not supports  IRI will  be second  class citizen  in the  gemini
space, and they will die slowly.

So i think that IRI will be a de facto standard. :/

Bye!
