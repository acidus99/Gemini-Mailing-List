<PRE>I see this as the same issue that exists for clients - without a trusted
CA, there's nothing to stop me masquerading as anyone else, other than the
certificate (e.g. fingerprint) pinning, so I believe the process absolutely
needs a (one-time) login prompt to pin the certificate - I can't see a way
to avoid it.

Your question made me think about what would be the minimum steps required
to implement client TOFU with PIN or password verification, and the code
below is my take on what I think has to happen. Note the code is only meant
as a concise way to discuss the process.

So, for example, a request to a private resource, such as: -

<A HREF="gemini://susa.net/cgi-bin/private.sh?articleId=1234">gemini://susa.net/cgi-bin/private.sh?articleId=1234</A>

Might be handled something like this: -

$ cat private.sh
#!/bin/bash

# If we have no client certificate, request one.
if [[ &quot;${TLS_CLIENT_HASH}&quot; == &quot;&quot; ]]; then

    echo -ne &quot;60 CLIENT CERTIFICATE REQUIRED\r\n&quot;

elif [[ $(grep &quot;${TLS_CLIENT_HASH}&quot; /tmp/${REMOTE_USER}_sigs) == &quot;&quot; ]]; then

    # We've never seen this user's client hash, so challenge for a PIN
    # (we could store this current URL for onward forwarding)
    echo -ne &quot;30 /cgi-bin/login.sh\r\n&quot;

else

    echo -ne &quot;20 text/gemini\r\n&quot;
    echo &quot;This is the prize inside the protected resource!&quot;
fi

I think a redirect to a login process is unavoidable, because any
originating request might have its own query_string, yet we're going to
need one for the password prompt response. So the login.sh would be our
one-time verification to pin the certificate to a CN based user-id.

$ cat login
#!/bin/bash

# If we have no client certificate, request one.
if [[ &quot;${TLS_CLIENT_HASH}&quot; == &quot;&quot; ]]; then
    echo -ne &quot;60 CLIENT CERTIFICATE REQUIRED\r\n&quot;
    exit
fi

# If the certificate has no CN, then reject it
if [[ &quot;${REMOTE_USER}&quot; == &quot;&quot; ]]; then
    echo -ne &quot;20 text/gemini\r\n&quot;
    echo &quot;Your CN can't be used as a user-id!&quot;
    exit
fi

# We have a client certificate, is it already authorised?
if [[ $(grep &quot;${TLS_CLIENT_HASH}&quot; /tmp/${REMOTE_USER}_sigs) != &quot;&quot; ]]; then
    echo -ne &quot;20 text/gemini\r\n&quot;
    echo &quot;You are already authorised!&quot;
    exit
fi

# We have a certificate and a valid user-id (CN), so either prompt for
# a PIN, or verify PIN if we've been given a QUERY_STRING.

# Grep the remote user's line from the passwd file (format CN:PIN)
PWD_ENTRY=$(grep &quot;^${REMOTE_USER}:&quot; login_passwd)

# Strip the CN value and separator, leaving the PIN
MY_PIN=&quot;${PWD_ENTRY#${REMOTE_USER}:}&quot;

# Check for our PIN in the query string (which may be empty)
if [[ &quot;${QUERY_STRING}&quot; == &quot;${MY_PIN}&quot; ]]; then
    echo -ne &quot;20 text/gemini\r\n&quot;
    echo &quot;Your PIN checks out, ${REMOTE_USER}!&quot;
    echo &quot;${TLS_CLIENT_HASH}&quot; &gt;&gt;/tmp/${REMOTE_USER}_sigs
    echo &quot;Your hash has been stored in '/tmp/${REMOTE_USER}_sigs'&quot;
    exit
fi

echo -ne &quot;11 Please enter your PIN, ${REMOTE_USER}\r\n&quot;
