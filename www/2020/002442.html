<PRE>Hi Andre

thanks for your reply

Yes REBOL/Red is very nice, but largely under-appreciated, and somewhat 
niche now I suppose.

A Red client would be cool - I think the TLS is WIP in Red, but 
apparently it is being developed. There is also a fork of REBOL which is 
being actively maintained and seems to include TLS. I've not 
investigated it much yet though.

</I>&gt;<i> I don't have any KaiOS device but I am intrigued by it. Some months

</I>
Thanks for these links - I shall add this to my todo list and 
investigate further. It would be interesting to see how far it can go. I 
think the client generated certificates is only a minor limitation, as 
the overwhelming majority of content in geminispace is freely accessible.

Best Wishes
