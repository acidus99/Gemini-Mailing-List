&quot;   In Internet messages, line endings in text/plain MIME entities are
   represented by CR+LF character sequences (see RFC 2046 [3] and RFC
   3676 [6]).  However, some protocols (such as HTTP) additionally allow
   other conventions for line endings.&quot;

precedent of protocols allowing for other line endings, so the gemini spec
could just say the same thing that http does about line endings.

<A HREF="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.7.1">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.7.1</A>

&quot;   When in canonical form, media subtypes of the &quot;text&quot; type use CRLF as
   the text line break. HTTP relaxes this requirement and allows the
   transport of text media with plain CR or LF alone representing a line
   break when it is done consistently for an entire entity-body. HTTP
   applications MUST accept CRLF, bare CR, and bare LF as being
   representative of a line break in text media received via HTTP.&quot;
