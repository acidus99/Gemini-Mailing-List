</I>&gt;<i> Hey all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;ve been working on a native Gemini browser app for iOS and macOS called Rocketeer for a little while now, and I decided to finally release a public alpha for the iOS version.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It&#8217;s written entirely from scratch with no dependencies aside from the OS, so it&#8217;s very lightweight. The feature set is pretty slim right now, but I wanted to have something out there while I continue working on it. It of course makes Gemini requests and renders text/gemini documents. Rocketeer also registers itself as a <A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> protocol handler, so links tapped in other apps will open it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are a few screenshots here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://social.shadowfacts.net/media/28bfba91-b609-4433-ba26-36f40fd793eb/Rocketeer.png">https://social.shadowfacts.net/media/28bfba91-b609-4433-ba26-36f40fd793eb/Rocketeer.png</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And you can try the app by joining the beta through TestFlight:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone has any issues, suggestions, or other feedback, please let me know! You can of course email me at this address, and I&#8217;m also on the fediverse as @<A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini">shadowfacts at social.shadowfacts.net.</A>

Oh, wow. This is _great_. Dark mode right out of the gate? Be still, my beating heart.

Requests, in no particular order:

- The link-color/background color contrast is a little low in dark mode. I generally don&#8217;t have issues with contrast, but link text is a bit dark to read easily. Could you make the link text a bit lighter?

- Add titles to the buttons. Right now, when I turn on Voice Control (&#8220;hey Siri, turn on Voice Control&#8221;) and say &#8220;show names&#8221; the buttons on the bottom have names like &#8220;Arrow.clockwise&#8221;. Could these be changed to &#8220;Back&#8221;, &#8220;Forward, &#8220;Reload&#8221;, &#8220;Share&#8221;, and &#8220;Settings&#8221; (what both Overcast and PCalc use)?

(I cannot wait to browse Geminispace when my hands are coated in partially-mixed hamburger meat)

- swipe-from-edge behavior to go back and forward

- Consider having a minimum 44-point height for links (this may be ugly and/or a lot of work to not be ugly). While almost all links are two rows high on my 1st-generation iPhone SE, most links are only one line on my 10.5&#8243; iPad when it&#8217;s in landscape mode. It&#8217;s kind of tough to aim for a single line on, say, CAPCOM when any given link has two close-by neighbors. For one way to do this sort of thing, have a look at the screenshot associated with &#8220;The Best Comments Experience&#8221; on <A HREF="https://apolloapp.io/">https://apolloapp.io/</A> &#8212; the currently-being-swiped comment is basically all one link, but there&#8217;s a nice, easy-to-hit button for it. (For Gemini, having the link _be_ that minimum-height button would probably be best, since we don&#8217;t have to worry about a bunch of consecutive words in a sentence being separate links.)

- I visited &lt;<A HREF="gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/users/adiabatic/tracker.webp?on=/">gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/users/adiabatic/tracker.webp?on=/</A>&gt; and the error message got ellipsis-truncated, not wrapped. I had to rotate my phone 90&#176; to read the entire message. (I&#8217;m not sure _why_ it failed, but WebP is the new kid on the block when it comes to WebKit support. I blame its newness.)

- Fix the share-button crash that seems to happen only on my iPad (Apple should get those crash reports to you; if not, ping me and I&#8217;ll see if I can dig them out of my iPad the old-fashioned way).

And in the &#8220;_much_ less important requests&#8221; pile&#8230;

- Aim assist (that&#8217;s what console FPS players call it, at least; Apple seems to call it &#8220;Magnetism&quot;) doesn&#8217;t seem to work for trackpad cursors. That is, the proxy fingertip won&#8217;t snap to the outline of the bottom-bar buttons like it will for Safari&#8217;s buttons. You can (kinda) see this effect on <A HREF="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211008">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211008</A> on the second screenshot, er, screenmovie.

Apparently only a handful of buttons get this feature for free; in Overcast&#8217;s UI, only the buttons on the left half of the screen (pick-a-playlist and pick-an-episode-in-a-playlist) have auto-aim enabled.

=&gt; <A HREF="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10640/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10640/</A> I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d even bother for myself, but if you&#8217;re bored&#8230;


&#8212;&#8212;

Once again, Rocketeer is absolutely wonderful. Thank you again for making it.
