I totally get this.  I really want to spec TLS 1.3 as the bare minimum
permitted for Gemini because it gets rid of a lot of that complexity.
Web browsers can't afford to do this because they need to support all
the old servers out there.  We don't have that legacy and could start
with a clean slate of a simpler, less fiddly TLS.  All that holds me
back is that this would rule out a lot of otherwise very compelling TLS
libraries which don't yet have TLS 1.3 support.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
