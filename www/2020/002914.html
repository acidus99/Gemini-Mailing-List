I completely agree, the site should be readily accessible to visitors
with visual impairments, and I'm suitably embarrassed that I didn't
consider this.  The current design was certainly *not* deliberately
chosen to emphasise the fact (although naturally I think it's a great
fact to emphasise) that Gemini's lack of author-controlled styling for
content makes this kind of problem impossible.  I just chose some
colours, probably fairly quickly, which looked nice enough according to
my own personal tastes...

&gt;<i> &gt; I agree with everyone's overall sentiment about accessibility and having

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; delightful?
</I>
...which I'm glad some other people share!

Would that be <A HREF="https://contrastchecker.com/?">https://contrastchecker.com/?</A>  Thanks for making me aware
that suck checkers exist, I didn't realise there were tools like that
out there for handling this.  I will change the colours this weekend to
a scheme which meets accessibility standards.

Cheers,
