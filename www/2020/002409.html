<PRE>Hey all!

I've been working on a project based on Gemini that you might be
interested in:

=&gt; <A HREF="https://flounder.online/">https://flounder.online/</A>

It's a simple website builder, kind of like Geocities for Gemini. I have
really enjoyed Gemini and the Gemini network and I wanted to create a
platform that made building static Gemini sites easy and accessible. I
was inspired by Solderpunk's work on Shizaru
(<A HREF="https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/shizaru/">https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/shizaru/</A>), where files are limited to
32KiB in size, which provides some interesting restrictions. I think
it's a cool way to get people into the &quot;small web&quot; who might be
interested in its principles politically or philosophically but lack the
technical abilities to use some of the existing tools. 

I also implement twtxt -- The twtxt protocol fits really well with
Gemini. It seems to be almost entirely inactive, but I think it's neat.

Right now, I'm only serving static content on Gemini via Agate. I want
to create more dynamic content (e.g. the homepage), but I haven't
prioritized that work yet. I also have yet to find a great way of
translating links between gemini / https (right now it's via proxy) It's
still very early in development, but it's usable and people seem to be
having fun so far. Feel free to join if you're interested!

You can find the Rust code here:

contributions.

All the best,

Alex
