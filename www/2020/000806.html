There's a few decent ideas floating around already, I'll admit. I hope
one of them resonates with people. I'm wary of ones that involve adding
things to a gemini file, though, especially if they're not spec. If one
server decides to implement a language header by adding content to the
top of a .gmi, then moving content to another server type has burden
added. Little things like that add up and you end up with the different
&quot;flavors&quot; like markdown.

This is doubly true for what plugd was saying about gopher maps not
looking like the files that they are authored in for many gopher
servers. I would hope we can avoid this problem from the start. The .gmi
spec is simple and flexible. I'd hate to see us get into a situation
where we are creating new languages to generate it for transport so
early in the life of gemini.

I like your idea of a metadata file. I doubly-like it because then it's
an individual problem servers can handle on their own without us needing
to address anything more in the specs.
