</I>

um.... &lt;smile&gt;, Sean I have to call attention here to the fact that such
an implementation of security isn't actually as simple as you portray in
that statement, lolz...

For example, just a couple of days ago you touted the libtls that you
[were able to] took advantage of, as a result of developing GLV-1.12556
being written in Lua ;)

In fact, you posted a tiny snippet of text showing how simple it was (in
that language), lending in part, to the simplicity of a Gemini server
being possible as a result of a weekend coding and beer session.

On the other hand, I recall quite clearly, Michaels encyclopedic
lamentations on the vagaries of attempting to acheive successful results
in Python, with regards to TLS and client/transient certs, due to the
horrendous state of Python libs in that regard :)

Just sayin', yes, it's trivial because you chose (whether by design or
inadvertantly) a framework upon which to support TLS, while in practice,
the implementation for others isn't necessarily so straight-forward ;)


&gt;<i>   In fact, that's part of why HTTPS was so successful---it doesn't change
</I>&gt;<i> the HTTP protocol at all.  It just slips in between TCP and HTTP and is
</I>&gt;<i> transparent to both.
</I>

Again, you chose something other than Python3 to do this with :)


&gt;<i>   I know that given the self-sign certificate nature of Gemini decreases
</I>&gt;<i> security a bit (TOFU and all that), not *all* Gemini servers are using
</I>&gt;<i> self-signed certificates.  There's at least two that I know of that use
</I>&gt;<i> actual signed certificates (from Let's Encrypt), and for my own server, I
</I>

My servers are among those :)


&gt;<i>   What's still missing from your proof-of-concept though, is support for
</I>&gt;<i> client certificates.  Yes, you have the &quot;transient&quot; stuff working, but for
</I>&gt;<i> my Gemini server, I have a second that is unavailable unless you have a
</I>&gt;<i> signed certificate from me.  Send in a certificate request, I generate the
</I>&gt;<i> certificate and send that back, and you can access the sooperseecret portion
</I>&gt;<i> of my site [3] (no one has done that yet; then again, I haven't exactly
</I>&gt;<i> advertised that I would do that either).
</I>
That's really kewl, but it brings to mind the notion (at least to me),
that we may be painting ourselves into a corner by specifying a method
of encryption in canon that precludes the possibility for allowing other
methods, emerging or otherwise, that might *date* the Gemini protocol's
utility moving forward.

Question: Isn't it (even if non-trivial) possible, to account for other
methods of encryption by the listening daemon, some servers being able
to secure communications by one or another method if the upcoming
clients can also support those technologies?

I'm just thinking that security is a moving, and mostly reactive, rather
than proactive target, but allowing for the adoption, in a proactive
way, for the inclusion of developing encryption methods might be a good
thing to ensure that something like Gemini isn't relegated to the
boneyard when earlier methods two decades and more are eventually
deprecated (Like true SSL was).


&gt;<i>   I'm still going over your code, but I'm not sure I can run it.  For one, I
</I>
I have no idea whether Ciprian's proof of concept can translate into
viable solutions, but I'm confident that if anyone can competently
evaluate the pros and cons of what he's suggesting - it is you my friend :)
