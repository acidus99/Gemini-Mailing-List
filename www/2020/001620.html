Actually there was Amaya (defunct 2012) which was a W3 reference browser 
which implemented read and write for the web. There was also a version 
of Netscape Navigator (3.04 Gold) that had something too.

Sadly it never really took off as it is less than 1% (n.b. made up 
statistic) of people that write the content on the web, so no-one really 
needed that functionality. But in Gemini, the readers and writers are a 
more overlapping set, as the barriers to participation are lowered.

However, as we all know, what really did explode was the wiki concept of 
being able to edit content in your browser, which has led to the 
plethora of editable websites we see today and markdown.

I'd really like to see a simple concept in gemini (+friends) of being 
able to do this. It would be good to thrash this out.

We already have the simplest, most useful text based markup language, so 
that bit is done.

I think your ideas for a schema are a good start.

&gt;<i> C: gemini+<A HREF="put://example.com/path/to/new.txt?mime=text/plain&amp;size=1024">put://example.com/path/to/new.txt?mime=text/plain&amp;size=1024</A> CRLF
</I>&gt;<i> S: 1x continue CRLF
</I>&gt;<i> C: size bytes of content
</I>
I would like to see the target path be a percent encoded parameter to 
the end point, otherwise we cannot so easily implement multiple end 
points on the same server. For example there might be a number of 
different server of CGI applications able to receive content on the same 
server or domain.

so maybe something like this is a more flexible way to specify the put 
request

C: gemini+<A HREF="put://example.com/put-handler?path=path/to/new.txt?mime=text/plain&amp;size=1024">put://example.com/put-handler?path=path/to/new.txt?mime=text/plain&amp;size=1024</A> CRLF
&lt;continues&gt;

One idea I've been working with is to integrate this with the preformatted area of a page, and then the client could render certain types using a text editor, something like this:

```gemini+<A HREF="write://example.com/put-handler?path=path/to/new.txt">write://example.com/put-handler?path=path/to/new.txt</A>

this content can be edited by the user and the client provides a button somewhere to &quot;submit&quot; it

```end of content

On submitting, the mime=text/plain and size=XYZ is provided
