Hi Gary

Thanks for your response.

My thinking is this: SNI is how the client tells the server which host
it wants to reach in case multiple hosts are hosted on the same IP.
Thus, the spec says: in order to facilitate name-based virtual hosting,
we want SNI to be part of the standard. That is, both users Alex and
Gary could host their sites on a single server, and they could both use
their own server certificates. The server would receive requests from
clients for either Alex's site or Gary's site, know which certificate
to send back to the client, and serve the appropriate content. This is
the benefit of SNI.

In my mind, this doesn't require hostname verification, though! Alex's
certificate could have used the common name &quot;Alex Schroeder&quot; and Gary's
certificate could have used the common name &quot;Gary Johnson&quot;. All the
client sees is a certificate, which it trusts on first use (TOFU).
Users might decide to look at the common name of the certificate, or
not. There's not even the need to provide a common name &#8211; we could have
generated our certificates using nothing but our email address, or our
organization name.

In short, I'm claiming all of these are valid certificates for a Gemini
site at alexschroeder.ch, even if they are invalid certificates for a
HTTPS site at alexschroeder.ch (maybe? I'm ignoring alt subject name):

openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -sha256 -text | grep Subject
        Subject: emailAddress = <A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini">alex at gnu.org</A>

openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -sha256 -text | grep Subject
        Subject: CN = Gemini Wiki

openssl x509 -in /var/lib/dehydrated/certs/transjovian.org/cert.pem
-noout -sha256 -text | grep Subject
        Subject: CN = transjovian.org

What do you think? Do you think SNI inherently mandates that the
subject have a common name field that matches the domain? It would have
to be implied in the X.509 spec somewhere, I guess?

Cheers
Alex
