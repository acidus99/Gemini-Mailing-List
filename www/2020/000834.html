</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ---
</I>&gt;<i> 4.1.1.  Representation of Line Breaks
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    The canonical form of any MIME &quot;text&quot; subtype MUST always represent a
</I>&gt;<i>    line break as a CRLF sequence.  Similarly, any occurrence of CRLF in
</I>&gt;<i>    MIME &quot;text&quot; MUST represent a line break.  Use of CR and LF outside of
</I>&gt;<i>    line break sequences is also forbidden.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    This rule applies regardless of format or character set or sets
</I>&gt;<i>    involved.
</I>&gt;<i> ---
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since text/gemini is, well, text/gemini, it is a &quot;text&quot; subtype and
</I>&gt;<i> using anything other than CRLF means we're violating the RFCs we're

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, CRLF everywhere it is.

</I>&gt;<i> only need to handle the &quot;canonical&quot; format, no matter what authors do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Rationale: Don't break foundational RFCs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I know, this is tedious and no fun for server authors, but, well,

</I>
My only concern with this is the &quot;server's job&quot; part. I'd rather not
have my server transform user-supplied content, even if it's something
as minor as line breaks. Apache doesn't attempt to fix invalid HTML, why
should SecretShop fix invalid text/gemini? Seems to me this should be
handled by something like the gemini vim-syntax plugin.

It also makes writing servers a bit more complicated since text/gemini
has to be treated differently from other files and actually parsed
versus being directly served up. Not the biggest deal (and you've
already admited it's tedious) but just something I noticed.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ISSUE 4:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Problem: Name-based virtual hosting is explicitly described as being
</I>&gt;<i> supported in the spec, but no mention is made of SNI (Server Name
</I>&gt;<i> Indication, a TLS extension which puts the desired server hostname in
</I>&gt;<i> the TLS handshake).  Without this, virtual hosting can't be made to
</I>&gt;<i> work reliably.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Proposal: Mandate use of SNI by clients.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
SecretShop implements virtual-hosting with the assumption that clients
are using SNI, so I'm in favour.
