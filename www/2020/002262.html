<PRE>I did consider a succession of inputs. I think we can all agree that a
succession of modal inputs is irritating, and the UI would be exactly that
on most clients.

Asking the user to use a separator seemed error prone, so I didn't want to
do that either. I know it can work. makeworld's gemlikes has a prompt of:

&gt;<i> Enter your username, a space, and your comment
</I>
Usernames don't have spaces, and comments do, so this works great here. I'm
just not sure people are going to get &quot;name;location;link;comment&quot; right
consistently. I certainly wouldn't, I'd end up with &quot;paul;;my comment&quot;
instead of &quot;paul;;;my comment&quot; and get my comment in the link field.

Your UNIX command-line comment is interesting. One set of input args is
enough for UNIX, so maybe getopt style flags?

--name John --location &quot;From Beyond&quot; --comment &quot;This is what I have to say&quot;

A form still seems right for a guestbook (the real-life version is a form
after all). But there ought to be something interesting we can do with
flags on the input line. Maybe an ASCII art drawing program? With inputs
like &quot;line --from 0,0 --to 10,10&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i> I'll stick to things that fit better in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's really valuable to *try* all kinds of things and
</I>&gt;<i> different approaches to see *what* fits well. IMHO we have only
</I>&gt;<i> scratched the surface of what is possible with the Gemini protocol
</I>&gt;<i> (and what makes for good UX).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To summarize what has been discussed here:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Filling in multiple values is not trivial with the input response type
</I>&gt;<i> 2. One way is to generate a session id on the server. (This is
</I>&gt;<i> stateful, which has some downsides but avoids replay issues.)
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Another way is to embed all the responses in the URL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some ideas that haven't been mentioned:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a. If you include all the fields at once, you could just ask for them
</I>&gt;<i> in one request. Eg. &quot;10 name;location;link;comment&quot; which the user is
</I>&gt;<i> smart enough to parse and respond with &quot;Hannu;;;This is cool!&quot;. Or for
</I>&gt;<i> a better UX, make the fields newline-separated (ie. %0A in the URL)
</I>&gt;<i> and have multiline-capable input fields in browsers. Note: this is
</I>&gt;<i> against a strict interpretation of the spec but hasn't been discussed
</I>&gt;<i> AFAIK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> b. Instead of having different links for different fields, you could
</I>&gt;<i> ask for the fields in succession (but this only works well for the
</I>&gt;<i> session id based approach). Eg. /guestbook/sign responds with &quot;30
</I>&gt;<i> /guestbook/sign/aF3d&quot;, then /guestbook/sign/aF3d responds with &quot;10
</I>&gt;<i> Name&quot;, /guestbook/sign/aF3d?Hannu with &quot;10 Location (optional)&quot;, then
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;10 Link (optional)&quot; and &quot;10 Comment&quot; in sequence, saving each query
</I>&gt;<i> string to the server-side session. After the final response either
</I>&gt;<i> save the comment or show the responses with a link to save.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I personally think the Gemini protocol (as it currently is) can be as
</I>&gt;<i> powerful as the UNIX command line (note: only CLI, not TUI). In fact,
</I>&gt;<i> you could serve a remote shell over Gemini. Of course we're all
</I>&gt;<i> spoiled by interactive software even in a terminal so Gemini feels
</I>&gt;<i> quite limited.
