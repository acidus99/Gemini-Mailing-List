I've already made it very clear in the main [spec] thread for this topic
that whether we adopt IRIs or not, the use of &quot;UTF-8 encoded URL&quot; should
be fixed, as it is likely to cause confusion.  Rest assured, when the
decision is made, this will be fixed accordingly.  There's no need to
split the thread over this.

It's not true that URLs cannot be UTF-8.  In fact, the opposite is true.
The characters valid in a URL are a subset of those which can be
represented in ASCII, and all byte strings which are valid ASCII are also
valid UTF-8, with equivalent decodings.  Hence, *every* URL is UTF-8.
So there. :p

The idea that, as a general principle, when an existing sentence in the
spec is ambiguous or inconsistent, the problem should be resolved by
granting absolute priority to whichever term occurs first in the current
form of the sentence is, plainly, absurd.

It's probably not a hill I'll choose to die on when it comes time to
update the spec based on the IRI decision, but personally I reject the
modern notion that the URL/URN (or IRL/IRN) distinction is not important
and thus everything should be specified at maximum generality as a URI
(or IRN).  The difference matters and protocols/formats should choose
appropriately.  The practical question of how to handle a text/gemini
document becomes *considerably* murkier when link lines contain URNs (of
course, you and I know this quite well already).
