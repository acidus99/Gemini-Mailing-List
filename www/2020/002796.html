<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Sandra Snan once stated:
&gt;<i> We'll look back years from now when gemspace collective standards have a
</I>&gt;<i> complexity that overshadows that of the W3C specifications, and maybe
</I>&gt;<i> we'll recognize that this moment, this post was the Rubicon. Maybe we'll
</I>&gt;<i> think that the Pandora lid was already peeked through to the point of no
</I>&gt;<i> salvation, since an arbitrary sequence of GET requests could become a
</I>&gt;<i> protocol.
</I>
  Nope.  The Rubicon was passed earlier this year with talk of the titan:
protocol which allowed people to upload content to a Gemini server and has
already been implemented by at least one Gemini server.  Just go to this
link:

	<A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/thread.html">https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/thread.html</A>

and search for &quot;titan&quot;.  You'll find the threads.  Also search for the
thread &quot;Uploading Gemini Content&quot;.  Again, you'll find the threads.

  What I find sad is that this appears to be separate approach from the
titan: proposal, which either means the designers of this were not aware of
of the previous work, or have rejected the previous work for some unstated
reason---I'm hoping it's the former.

&gt;<i> The question raised by this isn't just &quot;why Dioscuri?&quot; It's &quot;why should
</I>&gt;<i> we not use sftp, https, JSON, XML, sexp, IRC, SMTP, foo bar baz frotz
</I>&gt;<i> for this problem?&quot; That isn't rhetorical. There could be good answers. I
</I>&gt;<i> just can't think of them.
</I>
  Again, check the history of this list. It has been discussed before.

	archives are sent in the headers to every message ... )
