Correct.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> understand?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Nope.  It is a valid URI reference, because it is a valid relative
reference.  It is *not* a valid URI.

In what follows, I am going to assume that &quot;URL&quot; and &quot;URI&quot; are synonymous,
which they have been for 15 years since RFC 3986 was published.

&gt;<i> No, the spec allows both the full URI, and a relative URI as long as it
</I>&gt;<i> starts with '//' (it has the authority section).  The wording in the spec
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> bad and should be changed to clarify it, but that's the current
</I>&gt;<i> specification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There are two cases:

1) In a Gemini-protocol request line (section 2), the second sentence says
that an absolute URL (that is, a URI without a fragment identifier) is
required.  The third sentence says that if the &quot;<A HREF="scheme://">scheme://</A>&quot; portion is
missing (in which case it is not a URI, much less an absolute URI), it
should be prefixed with &quot;<A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A>&quot; and presumably reparsed.  That's
straightforward.

2) In a link line (section 5.4.2), we are told that there may be an
absolute or a relative URL.  There are no relative URIs, so we can only
interpret this as meaning a relative reference.  We are also told that if
the URL lacks a scheme (which is impossible: a URI always has a scheme)
then the scheme is &quot;gemini&quot;.

Now suppose a link line in a resource that is available from &quot;<A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A>
example.com/public/this.gmi&quot; has the form &quot;foo/bar/baz.gmi&quot;.  We can
interpret this in one of two incompatible ways:

2a) a truncated version of &quot;<A HREF="gemini://foo/bar/baz.gmi">gemini://foo/bar/baz.gmi</A>&quot;.  Note that &quot;foo&quot; is
a perfectly valid host name.

2b) a relative reference, in which case it resolves to &quot;<A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A>
example.com/public/foo/bar/baz.gmi&quot;.

So the spec is self-contradictory.  In my view interpretation 2a is bogus
and the sentence &quot;If the URL does not include a scheme, a scheme of
<A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> is implied&quot; in section 5.4.2 should be removed.  What is more, I
would like to see the equivalent sentence &quot;If the scheme of the URL is not
specified, a scheme of <A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> is implied&quot; removed as well.

&gt;<i> but that's what it is, other URI parsers that are more strict with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compliance to the RFC will refuse to parse a URI without scheme
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; present,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   If it does, it's broken by design.  Again, see the ABNF above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It is precisely the ABNF line in RFC 3986 section 3 that says a URI (as
opposed to a URI reference) has to begin with a scheme.

It's the old, old story.  Droid meets droid.  Droid becomes chameleon.
Droid loses chameleon, chameleon becomes blob, droid gets blob back
again.  It's a classic tale.  --Kryten, Red Dwarf
