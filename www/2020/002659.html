Great points. My main goal is to address the fact that the spec
underdefines the alt text field. I want it to decide on one use such
that clients could depend on it always being suitable for that use.

Thanks for pointing out that what we think of as &quot;alt text&quot; in HTML is
not the same thing as the alternative representation used by screen
readers. In that light, I don't want Gemini's preformat alt text to be
machine-readable, nor do I want it to be an HTML alt text style tooltip
or caption.

I think it should behave like the &quot;title&quot; attribute. I want Gemini to
offer accessibility affordances where the nature of plain text does not
already provide them, and this seems like the right use for that. I
think it would also be suitable to change the name from &quot;alt text&quot; to
something like &quot;accessibile description&quot;.

&gt;<i> &gt;(You might be thinking &#8220;well, what about that Markdown meme where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;people write &#8216;```javascript&#8217; to start off a JavaScript code block, with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the idea that a syntax highlighter will read it and colorize the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;output?&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> The original point of suggesting that it be displayed for all users was
</I>&gt;<i> to discourage turning text intended for humans into text intended for
</I>&gt;<i> machines anyways, but I believe an alternate solution other than
</I>&gt;<i> displaying it for everybody would still be preferable.
</I>
Yep, that is what I meant, to drop machine-readability in favor of human
readability.

&gt;<i> Rewriting that portion of the spec to emphasize that it is not to be
</I>&gt;<i> parsed in any way other than as natural language?  Maybe say that a
</I>&gt;<i> client *should be able to* completely replace the preformatted block
</I>&gt;<i> with the contents of the alt text without the document losing
</I>&gt;<i> significant meaning? That would work for ascii art and short code
</I>&gt;<i> snippets, but it might not be doable for longer code blocks.
</I>
An accessible description for a long code block seems like a non-goal,
though, because when code is text, I imagine that makes it accessible to
a screen reader.

When considering these details it is helping me to draw a clear line
between an accessible content description and a caption. I think we want
the former, not the latter.
