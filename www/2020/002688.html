</I>
Here are a few options that avoid complicating Gemtext.

1. Use alt text only as an accessible content description for humans.
   (not a tooltip or caption)
2. Use alt text only as a formatting hint for machine use. Rename it.
3. Get rid of alt text entirely.

All of these options attempt to solve the problem that alt text
currently has multiple uses and would not be reliable to a user who
needed it for a particular use. Any of these options would mean altering
the spec. I like option 1 best.

The reason I didn't mind syntax-on-top, alt-on-bottom was that it solved
the problem of one field with multiple uses, by making them two fields.
However it would complicate Gemtext and I agree we don't need to
do that.
