So that would define a special percent-encoding for clients, where
they'd encode everything except percent signs, right? So in this link:
=&gt;<A HREF="gemini://example.com/&#128048;&#129365;&#128007;&#128048;-why-space-is-%20-in-urls.gmi">gemini://example.com/&#128048;&#129365;&#128007;&#128048;-why-space-is-%20-in-urls.gmi</A>
, a client would have to percent-encode the emojis, but leave the &quot;%20&quot;
bit alone? This seems very confusing; it's also not one-to-one (encoding
then decoding &quot;%20&quot; gives &quot; &quot; back)... And if you just skip
percent-encoding when the only &quot;encodable&quot; characters in the path are
percent signs, that's confusing too. That rule also doesn't work on
=&gt;<A HREF="gemini://example.com/%XY.gmi">gemini://example.com/%XY.gmi</A>

Also, if an author wants to link to &quot;why-space-is-%20-in-urls.gmi&quot; at
example.com, the only option would be to write
=&gt;<A HREF="gemini://example.com/why-space-is-%2520-in-urls.gmi">gemini://example.com/why-space-is-%2520-in-urls.gmi</A>
This introduces a pitfall for authors: they never have to think about
percent-encoding, *except* when there are percent signs in the path.

How is this better than agreeing that link paths in gemtext are always
completely percent-encoded? In that case, clients can percent-decode the
path and display that. Authors could use a tool that 'fully' (as in, it
also turns every &quot;%&quot; into &quot;%25&quot;) percent-encodes a link for them.

Counterintuitively, in this way I think mandating completely
percent-encoded paths in gemtext link lines might actually result in
easier linking for authors.

The same (clients may/should display, authors use tool) could be done
with internationalised domain names (could be the same tool that does
the percent-encoding), but crucially there is no ambiguity there,
because an ascii domain name with &quot;xn--&quot; is unrepresentable in punycode
and disallowed (I think). On the other hand, allowing anything
whatsoever in the domain name and nothing in the path would be strange
and a bit inconsistent.

Assuming we don't do IRI paths in gemtext link lines, I don't really
have an clear opinion regarding IDNs, the choice is between:
* all clients need to convert to punycode when following a link, authors
can easily link to IDNs without a tool (though they're already using a
tool for unicode paths), somewhat inconsistent/strange
* fancy clients will convert from punycode when displaying a link,
authors need a tool to be able to easily make links to IDNs (though
they're already using a tool for unicode paths)
