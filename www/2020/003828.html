I disagree with makeworld on this.

The idea of expiration comes from the Certificate Authority scheme of
certificate validation. A certificate authority will not lend their
trust to someone indefinitely, because that would eventually lead to a
horrible mess of billions of rejected certificates. Instead they put a
time limit on their certificates to say that &quot;if we haven't vouched
for this person/organisation in the last X months, just assume we no
longer do&quot;.

With a self-signed certificate the date is just a setting that the
certificate issuer can set arbitrarily, which means a middle-man
attacker can too. A valid date range doesn't in any way affect the
security of the certificate. The *only* valid question is &quot;Do I trust
this?&quot; which is somewhat of a catch 22. This is where TOFU comes in:
we assume that the certificate is correct the first time it's
presented to us, and subsequent checks are just a matter of &quot;is this
the same certificate already presented to me for this host?&quot;

Incidentally I wrote a gemlog post on the subject last night (after
the original mail in this thread was sent, but before I'd seen it --
my post had been in the brewing for a few days). Tell me if there's
anything that can be clarified in that post:
