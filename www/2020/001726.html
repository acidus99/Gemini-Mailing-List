<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Pete D. once stated:
&gt;<i> And so now, seeing all this wiki talk, I'm excited again by the idea of a 
</I>&gt;<i> wiki protocol, but at the same time, I feel like it really should be a 
</I>&gt;<i> different project. It's not what gemini is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we are turning this into a wiki protocol, why don't we have inline 
</I>&gt;<i> links and all the cool markup available to make nice documents (TOCs, 
</I>&gt;<i> etc), and versioning and all that?
</I>
  Sadly, that *is* HTTP.  HTTP/1.0 added the methods PUT and DELETE which
make adding/updating/removing resources from a webserver possible with just
a web client.  The methods map to:

	GET	Retrieve a resource, should be no side-effects on the server
	POST	Submit data to an existing resource
	PUT	Add a new resource (a file for example) to the server
	DELETE	Remove a resource (a file for example file) from the server

  The major difference between POST and PUT is that with POST, the resource
receiving the data isn't modified (it's a fixed endpoint) whereas with PUT,
the resource given is created or modified by the data.

  Of the complaints I've read online about Gemini, the question of &quot;why not
use HTTP&quot; comes up, and in a sense, I can see the reason for the
question---HTTP does *not* inherenetly imply spying and tracking but that
there are external forces that force that in the HTTP world.

  I still like the idea, but the trick is to tame (or limit) the damage that
can be done.
