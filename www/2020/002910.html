The two ideas I have for this are making them like footnotes or just putting them the line after.

Hi Nico

I think both are fine - there is no single established convention on 
this. Perhaps from gopher, the square bracket or unicode superscript 
footnote convention is reasonably well established, but simply emitting 
them after the relevant paragraph is OK too. Personally I prefer there 
to be a citation marker, as it makes it easier to see where the citation 
is made. Others prefer to just list the links without citation 
placemarkers, perhaps not even numbered.

I have a utility html2gmi which has to solve the same problem - it 
provides a number of options, including whether to number the citation 
placeholders, to number the footnote links, and the frequency of 
emitting the links within the document.

So horses for courses you might say.
