<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Ecmel Berk Canl&#305;er once stated:
&gt;<i> Hello all!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been checking out the mailing list and reading about Gemini every
</I>&gt;<i> now and then, and decided to try and host a Gemini server for my blog.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One question I had is: Which server software is the most mature one?
</I>
  What do you mean by &quot;most mature&quot;?  By age, it's GLV-1.12556 (disclaimer:
I wrote it).  By feature set, it's a toss-up between GLV-1.12556:

		* support for any type of documents (from multiple directories)
		* CGI (both Gemini and HTTP specific, RFC-3875 compliant)
		* user directories
		* client certificate support
		* easy to extend with custom modules (if you know Lua)

and Gemserv:

		* support for any type of document
		* CGI (Gemini only, not quite RFC-3875 compliant)
		* user directories
		* reverse proxy
		* virtual hosts

Both have recent updates. By popularity, last time I checked, it was
JetForce (which also has had recent updates).  Of the three mentioned,
JetForce is in Python, Gemserv in Rust, and GLV-1.12556 in Lua.  The lack of
virtual hosting in GLV-1.12556 is because I lack experience in dealing with
server certificates with multple hosts, and because of that, I can't exactly
test that feature.

&gt;<i> On the software list [1], there is no description about the state and
</I>&gt;<i> feature set of any of the listed server software.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [1]: <A HREF="gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/software/">gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/software/</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I only need to serve static files, as everything else happens on a
</I>&gt;<i> static site generator before being uploaded.
</I>
  If that's the case, then most of the servers would probably work, it then
comes down to which language do you have available for compiling/running the
server.
