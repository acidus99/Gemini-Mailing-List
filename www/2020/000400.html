<PRE>Just a quick response for now: nice post, thanks, there's a lot in here
that I agree with (and I had been starting to think similar things about
quotes), but can I ask you to elaborate on:

In particular, what do you mean by &quot;parsing lists semantically&quot;?

At no point in these discussions have I been envisaging anything to do
with lists which requires clients to recognise or keep track of whether
or not they are &quot;inside&quot; a list or not, or sticking lists in buffers.
I have imagined list items standing alone and &quot;lists&quot; being an emergent
property of a document that clients have no awareness of - in exactly
the same way that &quot;paragraphs&quot; are an emergenty property of lines (if
some of those lines happen to be blank).

Well, that's true for unordered lists, at least.  Ordered lists are
another story 

Cheers,
Solderpunk
