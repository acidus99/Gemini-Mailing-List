I often see quoted syntax (e.g. links, lists) on StackOverflow. However,
I haven't seen quoted syntax in phlogs. Plus, supported mixing nested
syntax could be a PITA to implement.

Also seen in the wild:
* nested lists of links (nice to have, but not sad if unsupported)
* hyperlink headers (this sounds like a mess regarding `=&gt; #` vs `# =&gt;`)

Either way, I'd still specify what nesting is/isn't allowed.

&gt;<i> I guess this is harmless.  It feels a bit to me like we're adding it

</I>
I see horizontal rules used in gopherspace all the time:

&gt;<i> It feels very strange to me for a syntax specification to explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> list stuff from a different syntax specification which isn't allowed.
</I>
You make a good point here. Maybe, we instead specify that clients MUST NOT
support non-specified syntax, in order to discourage pages with un-specified
syntax from being published in the first place.

&gt;<i> I don't want to explicitly ban hard-wrapped text, I don't see the need
</I>&gt;<i> to.  I think this syntax actually degrades pretty gracefully when fed
</I>&gt;<i> hard-wrapped text that is shorter than the viewport, and that's nice.
</I>
That makes sense. However, would it be unreasonable to state that users
&quot;SHOULD NOT&quot; hard-wrap, since doing so degrades quite poorly on mobile?

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are we really limited to a max depth of three? Even if we allow unlimited
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; depth of headers and lists, clients would only need to read the first two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chars of a line to determine its type (unless we add horizontal rules,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in which case we'd need to read three characters).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good catch, technically speaking once a line is detected, on the basis
</I>&gt;<i> of the first three or fewer chars, as a header or list, it can be passed
</I>&gt;<i> to a function than handles a header line or a list line, and that
</I>&gt;<i> function has access to the whole line.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That said, maybe we should add a limit anyway.  Otherwise clients have
</I>&gt;<i> to write totally generalised code to handle arbitrarily many levels,
</I>&gt;<i> which could get tricky.
</I>
Hmmm. If max depth is one, that makes sense. Same if max depth is two. But
once max depth is three, it sounds like clients would be using generalized
code anyway. Plus, a shallow max depth might be very confusing for authors
using text/gemini.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, worst case scenario, if someone really badly wants comment threads,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maybe they could use nested quote blocks (assuming we figure that out).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, it seems like the &gt; syntax generalises in exactly the same way as
</I>&gt;<i> the heading and list syntaxes.
</I>
But for quotes, I beg that a space character is allowed between the
greater-than symbols in nested quotes, so that we don't have to abandon
the way quotes are used in emails. In fact, I think the spec should say
that a single space after a `&gt;` symbol should always be stripped.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking of these...what happens when a client encounters this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ** Foo
</I>&gt;<i> ** Bar
</I>&gt;<i> ** Baz
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. a bunch of allegedly nested list items which are not emedded in a
</I>&gt;<i> higher-level list?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For a simple text-based client which only uses the nestedness level to
</I>&gt;<i> determine how many spaces to stick in front of the line, this shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> post major problems.  But fancy clients planning on doing graphical
</I>&gt;<i> things (I'm actually thinking more about quotes here than list items)
</I>&gt;<i> might choke if not carefully written.  Should we explicitly require
</I>&gt;<i> correct nesting?  Or explicitly say clients must be resilient against
</I>&gt;<i> weird nesting?
</I>
I personally think resilients is a bad idea. It's partially to blame for so
many web browser quirks nowadays. I think that if fancy clients refuse to
render invalid syntax, that could be a good deterrant. OTOH, it's sometimes
tough to contact gopher/gemini users, so maybe nobody would be able to tell
them something's wrong. Unless we write scripts to verify that text is valid
text/gemini, and/or integrate this functionality into servers?

Cheers!
