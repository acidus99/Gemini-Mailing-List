I honestly don't see the problem with this.  As has been pointed out, CAPCOM and Spacewalk, and as has been said, this format, all have &quot;problems&quot; with ordering replies before the original post.  I've never not been able to figure out which actually comes first.

Now that I'm thinking about it, the same problem comes up with Twitter and other social medias.  People are smart.  One thing I like about Gemini is it's a protocol that assumes people are smart.  We can figure things out.

Let's not over-engineer something because we think people *might* be confused for 1/2 of a second.
