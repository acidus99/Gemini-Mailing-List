I like the idea of severely limiting the available block-type options.

How about this for block syntax, with the understanding that the alt
text is highly recommended for accessibility. Specifying the block
type and the programming language or written language (as appropriate)
would be strictly optional: those that wanted to make use of them
could, those who did not want to make use of them would not have to.

For the purposes of this proposal, there would be *no space* between
the backticks and the optional content-type field, which field may not
contain spaces. There must be at least one space on the line before
the (recommended) alt text. That way, the client doesn't need to try
and figure out where one ends and one begins: the instant the client
sees a space, we're into alt-text territory for the rest of the line.

```[art | code[:programming language] | text[:written language]] [alt text]
...
```

So, e.g.,

```code:c The Laziest Hello World
#include &quot;real_hello_world.h&quot;
```

```text:fr_FR Antoine de Saint-Exup&#233;ry on perfection
	Il semble que la perfection soit atteinte non quand il n'y a
	plus rien &#224; ajouter, mais quand il n'y a plus rien &#224;
	retrancher.
		-- Terre des Hommes, 1939
```

``` This is a block with just alt text.
You know, I think the alt text is better than the content this time.
```

What the client does with the alt text and the block type, if
anything, is up to the author.

I think this way, it would be both nicely readable to a human reading
the source text/gemini, without sacrificing ease of parsing. Just
throwing an idea at the wall to see whether it sticks.

Cheers,
Ivy Foster
