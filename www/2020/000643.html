  Does Go actually check the permissions of a file before calling exec() on
it?  And refuse to run it if it's setuid?  That sounds strange to me.  Or do
you mean something like?

	child = fork()
	if (child == 0) /* child process */
	{
	  setuid(CGIowner);
	  exec(CGIprogram);
	}

  And because I feel compelled to state this:  setuid() only works for root.

  And it is possible to chroot programs, but it's not generally done in
these days of dynamically linked programs because you need to copy in all
the shared objects into the chroot with the program.  Hmmm ... I wonder if
you can't do a chroot with some LD_PRELOAD trickery ... might have to play
around with that.

&gt;<i> I'm frankly baffled that a language with Ken Thompson and Rob Pike as
</I>&gt;<i> designers, created specifically to help Google engineers write server
</I>&gt;<i> software, could turn out to be so terrible for...writing servers on
</I>&gt;<i> unix.
</I>
  Rob Pike doesn't trust programmers.  Direct quote from him:

	The key point here is our programmers are Googlers, they're not
	researchers.  They're typically, fairly young, fresh out of school,
	probably learned Java, maybe learned C or C++, probably learned
	Python. They're not capable of understanding a brilliant language
	but we want to use them to build good software. So, the language
	that we give them has to be easy for them to understand and easy to
	adopt.

&gt;<i> This was the reason that I pondered a few months back on this list some
</I>&gt;<i> kind of FastCGI-esque system for a Gemini server to communicate with a
</I>&gt;<i> process it didn't spawn itself over a domain socket or similar.  But
</I>&gt;<i> maybe I should just give up on Go for servers (this exact same issue
</I>&gt;<i> affects Shizaru, too.).
</I>
  FastCGI could be a way of doing it.  I might just look into that for
GLV-1.12556 ...
