<PRE>It was thus said that the Great <A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini">easeout at tilde.team</A> once stated:
&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> language specifiers.

  And back in the mid-90s, there *were* plenty of web clients.  Easily a
dozen that were easily available and that was back in time when it was easy
enough to parse HTML, there was no CSS and no Javascript, and it was
conceivable that someone could write a simple web browser in a weekend [1].

  Then Sandra Snan sent the following link:

	<A HREF="https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html">https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html</A>

Wherein it's mentioned that the current &quot;state of the web&quot; is described by
114,000,000 words spread across 1,217 standards documents.  You get here by
incremental changes, all of which are &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;it would be so nice.&quot;

  Also, don't forget that Gemini can *easily* serve up HTML documents.  And
Markdown documents.  And PDF.  And a host of other documentation formats
that all do what you want to do.  And then some.

  But hey, I can play this game.  I added the following non-standard
document:

	<A HREF="gemini://gemini.conman.org/test/preformat.gemini">gemini://gemini.conman.org/test/preformat.gemini</A>

that contains &quot;machine readable text&quot; at the opening preformatted marker,
and a &quot;human readable text&quot; on the ending preformatted marker, just to give
an indication of what it might look like and what might be done with it. 
Enough talk, *someone* has to do an implementation to scare the bejeezus out
of everyone (not that it's particularly scary in what I did).

  -spc (HTML people.  Seriously, HTML.  You want your format, you have it
	already ... )
