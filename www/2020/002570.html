<PRE>This is the first actual release of my line-based terminal haskell 
client diohsc.

It's developed somewhat since my initial announcement here a few months 
ago. It now aims to be a &quot;maximal-minimal&quot; client: it has many features, 
but each is implemented in a simple way. It also aims to play nicely as 
part of the commandline ecosystem: it outputs no terminal escape codes 
which could interfere with the terminal's scrollback, can be scripted 
(using -f), behaves well in a pipeline, and offers many ways to call and 
pipe data to shell commands. It is quite configurable.

=&gt; <A HREF="https://mbays.sdf.org/diohsc/">https://mbays.sdf.org/diohsc/</A>

The package now exists on hackage, which means you can install it once 
you have the cabal-install package with
```
cabal update &amp;&amp; cabal install diohsc
```
Please let me know if that doesn't work for you.

I put together a little &quot;asciicast&quot; tutorial to demonstrate basic 
features, which you can find at the above links.

For Windows users: It is reportedly possible to compile and run diohsc 
on Windows, but Windows support is an afterthought and probably doesn't 
work very well.

For MetaARPA sdf users: It's installed as /meta/sdf/bin/diohsc on mab 
(there's an unresolved ghc bug which stops it working on the cluster for 
now).

Comments and suggestions welcome!
