No doubt, but that does nothing to fix the fact that something is
clearly wrong wrong somewhere.

Gemini requests are URLs, with hostnames in them.  It's possible in
principle to connect to the foo.com host and send it a request for
<A HREF="gemini://bar.net,">gemini://bar.net,</A> and its possible in principle for foo.com to respond
to this by sending the request on to bar.net and then relaying the
response to the original client.  This is what is meant by &quot;proxying&quot; in
Gemini.

It is rarely used, and with good reason, as Gemini servers used as
proxies are also &quot;men in the middle&quot;.  There are legitimate uses,
though: my Agena software will accept Gemini requests for <A HREF="gopher://">gopher://</A>
URLs, fetch them and the translate Gopher menus into gemtext.  I run it
on localhost so it's just &quot;me spying on me&quot;.  It lets me use AV-98
(which can be configured to forward <A HREF="gopher://">gopher://</A> requests to such a proxy)
as both a Gemini client and Gopher client seamlessly, without having to
actually put any Gopher code into AV-98.  Any other client could easily
add support for this too.

Anyway, Molly Brown offers no support for any of this.  If it receives a
request for a URL with a hostname that doesn't match its configured
hostname, it will respond with a &quot;no proxying allowed&quot; error, and that's
the end of that.  The actual server system's hostname is not consulted.
If you're seeing these errors, it can only mean that your client is
sending a URL with the wrong hostname (or there's a bug in Molly Brown,
in which case we should try to identify and fix it, not just comment it
out).

Are you perhaps connecting to the server by typing its IP address into
your client, and not the hostname?  That's something I can think of
which would cause this (and perhaps shouldn't).

If that's not the case, look in your Molly Brown access log.  You'll be
able to see the URL your client is sending.  That will probably let us
know what's going on.

Cheers,
Solderpunk

It is on a different network segment than my desktop (client, trying out Kristall and elpher). When I try to connect to the server, I get a message &#8220;you tried to request a resource from one host that is actually located on another host.... No proxying to other hosts or ports.&#8221; The message is similar from the various clients and in the server&#8217;s log file.
