Well, this is awkward...how do you want these projects listed at the
software page?

&gt;<i> Now I know what solderpunk means when he talks about our software

I mean, it's not necessarily a bad thing, just terribly surprising and
kind of strange.  But I'm mostly taking it as a sign of success - it's
clearly possible for people to build their own Gemini tools quickly and
easily which was part of the whole idea.

My big concern is that during this period of high interest after
appearing on popular news sites, lots of people will write software in
their initial excitement then get bored and moved on, we'll make some
spec changes which require updates to thta software but it won't happen,
and we'll end up with a lot of slightly broken software around.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
