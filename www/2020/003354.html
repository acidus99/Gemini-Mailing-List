<PRE>&gt;<i> So, I want to make an app to view and edit gemini content. My
</I>&gt;<i> objective
</I>&gt;<i> is to create a blogging platform alternative to medium.com, with
</I>&gt;<i> gemini.
</I>
I was also thinking about this. I think, if I were to do this, I would
probably settle on one of the already established standards, probably
SFTP or E-Mail. For E-Mail, you could prepare something to your liking
in the App and then use a mailto:-Link to send it over to the server,
for SFTP you could use an already available library and put an ED25519
pubkey on the server using Gemini input. This is especially cool,
because it might work with already existing servers.

Thinking about it, if you are going to build an App around a
centralized service anyways, you could also just build a REST API and
use that one, this is also what HTTP was built for
