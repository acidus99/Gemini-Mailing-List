<PRE>On Tue, Nov 10, 2020 at 05:59:29PM +0100, Philip Linde said unto me:
&gt;<i> Does the client itself really need to do this? Allow the configuration
</I>&gt;<i> of MIME type handlers that delegate the task to other applications and
</I>&gt;<i> it's no longer strictly necessary, but would the user experience suffer?
</I>
I'd say it's perfectly reasonable to leave the implementation details up
to the client.  I'd be perfectly happy if a terminal client went and supported
mailcap(5) for example.

&gt;<i> Those formats would both be a hard no for me. If the goal of Gemini is
</I>&gt;<i> to be a protocol that makes the implementation of a client and server
</I>&gt;<i> simple, I don't think that recommending the inclusion of full
</I>&gt;<i> typesetting systems is reasonable. A full distribution of LaTeX in
</I>&gt;<i> particular can easily eat hundreds of megabytes, even gigabytes.
</I>
The implementation details ultimatly are up to the client author, as I say
above if they want to just shell out to a command that's fine.  The point is
that it seems like the desire to extend text/gemini keeps coming up, so to
avoid continuing to kick the can in a circle an alternate path may be to
provide guidance to client authors so we can also provide guidance to textual
authors that desire/require the extra expression.
