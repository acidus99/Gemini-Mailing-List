For the time being, it'd be a good step forward just to have a tool in
*any* language which reliably answered the question whether a file/string
were conformant with the spec. It'd be nice to be able to say 
sendfile(readfile()) and know that one's not breaking the strict reading
of the spec.

For this, it suffices to have a gemini-check tool rather than a gemini-fmt 
tool, which presumably would be able to output a new, conformant file.
