There are multiple solutions, each with different sets of flaws. An 
observatory's flaws don't necessarily signify that it's a bad idea; they 
could also signify that it shouldn't be out *only* idea.

An idea related to an observatory: I think that it would be awesome if 
crawlers like GUS saved certs and allowed people to search through them 
in a variety of ways or over a variety of protocols: Tor, i2p, 
downloading limited dump over bittorrent...I'm spitballing 
MITM-resistant protocols. I don't know the &quot;best&quot; ways to go about this 
while avoiding the negative privacy-related consequences of opening up 
the index, but offering cert-checking over multiple other MITM-resistent 
protocols could help vulnerable users who'd like to be extra careful 
during the first connection.

Hmm...Gemini-over-i2p actually sounds *awesome*, especially since the 
tiny footprint of Gemini pages could pair well with its speed loss.
