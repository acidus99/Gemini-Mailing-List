I don't think this is a good idea.  No email client is going to
recognise text/gemini (famous last words!) which means for most people
(okay, I don't have hard data, but I'm *assuming* most people aren't
reading the list on a mobile device) this will just result in a much
reduced user experience.

Once rawtext.club is back up you should at least be able to follow the
discussion (read-only) via text/gemini!

&gt;<i> P.S. I've been subscribed for a while, but I can't find the answer by searching the mailing list messages I've received: what happened to block quote syntax in text/gemini?
</I> 
I think the person/people who was/were really pushing hard for this were
really invested in a relatively complicated form of it which was
infinitely nestable, so it could be used to represent e.g. deep comment
threads, and I wasn't super keen on that idea.

As a purely optional line-type with no special semantics, acting just as
a styling hint, the way unordered item lists are currently implemented,
I think I'm actually fairly unopposed to adding this.

Of course it would, like everything else, be strictly line-based, so
quoting multi-paragraph content might not format the way people
expect...

Cheers,
