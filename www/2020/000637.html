Noted. Moving on : )

I did notice this.

&gt;<i> &gt; My only real criticism for Gemini is that it relies on TLS. I personally believe that all communications should be encrypted by default. Gemini insisting on encryption is good but going with TLS is bad when there are much better choices such as CurveCP.

</I>
I surely will. I'm curious about your thinking.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; Why shouldn't Gemini avoid relying on centralized solutions such as TLS and the CA system?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's true that not everybody (including myself) has properly implemented
</I>&gt;<i> it yet, but Gemini *does* deliberately and explicitly try to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> relying on the CA system by permitting clients to use a TOFU security
</I>&gt;<i> model.  Surely you read that in the spec?
</I>
Oops, I deleted some largely irrelevant parts of my reply that included me saying, &quot;I get it that Gemini allows for self-signed certs but if you're going with TOFU as a primary requirement then why not Noise? CurveCP does have some TOFU limintations around knowing public keys ahead of time and through secure independent distribution.&quot;

Looking forward to your gemlog. I wish we were using the term &quot;mission log&quot; instead, but meh, I'm indifferent.

Cheers!
Dave
