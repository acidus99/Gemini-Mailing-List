(At the risk of wading into this thread - I should know better)

Yes that is a sensible client design IMO, since you cannot know how long 
to wait. In my client GemiNaut (Windows only atm sorry folks), there are 
two options:

  - abandon download after X Mb or after Y seconds

The gemget client/utility also implements this approach, which is what 
GemiNaut uses under the hood.

The values are tunable according to the desires of the user. Mostly I 
have mine set to 5mb or 10 seconds. If something times out beyond that I 
make a judgement whether I really want to up the threshold temporarily 
to let it through. Or maybe go look elsewhere ;)

By and large tex/gemini content is very small and fast which is one of 
its great selling points. Other binary files are more &quot;meh&quot;.
