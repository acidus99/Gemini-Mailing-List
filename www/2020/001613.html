I'm not sure this makes sense: if you expect me to believe that you will
keep your private key secure from compromise for N days/months/years,
then why not just send me a certificate which doesn't expire for N
days/months/years?

But I could be jumping the gun on that.  I haven't had any coffee yet
and there are a host of other reasons that certificates expire beyond
concerns about key compromise.  Some of them don't really transfer from
CA-land to self-signed TOFU land.  But some may...in which case some
kind of &quot;long keys, short certs&quot; model might indeed make sense.
