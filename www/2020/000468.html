Wow, I had no idea that's how Veronica worked - no wonder I've had
trouble (re)finding some things with it in the past!

In addition to this thread, I've had a couple other conversations and
votes for content-based indexing over network-based indexing. So, I
think I'll keep it that way for now, and focus on improving the
tokenization/indexing quality.

I also just added search suggestions in the case of no results found,
which could be helpful in the case the searcher makes a query typo. It
also helps in the case of legitimately no results, which isn't too
far-fetched given the small amount of content we currently have :P

If anyone has other thoughts about desired features or undesired
anti-features please let me know. I want to make something useful, but
I also want to make sure the project is kind and respectful to Gemini
content creators :)
