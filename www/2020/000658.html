<PRE>After being a long-time subscriber to this list while having no idea 
what Gemini (or even Gopher) is, I've gotten to the point of running my 
own server. You should be able to access it at <A HREF="gemini://kwiecien.us/">gemini://kwiecien.us/</A>

It's a dummy page for now before I figure out what to do with it, but I 
intend to keep Gemini running on this host for good.

My first attempt was to use geminid (written in C) because I figure it'd 
compile most easily on my system, which runs FreeBSD. It did compile 
easy, but I haven't gotten it to work just yet likely because of not 
configuring it right.

Next try was with Jetforce because I already had Python3 on the system, 
which has very limited storage so this seemed better than tinkering with 
the environment and installing stuff that I won't use for anything else.

Jetforce seems to be working nicely enough, but if you find you can't 
access it let me know so I can figure out what's wrong.

I'm having an issue with elpher where it asks me to approve the site's 
SSL cert because it says something like the issuer not being 
recognized... well that can't be right, so either I set up Jetforce a 
little bit wrong (specified the wrong files?), or this is some issue 
with elpher, which I noticed complains about the certs of most Gemini 
sites. My issuer is LetsEncrypt, which should be fine.
