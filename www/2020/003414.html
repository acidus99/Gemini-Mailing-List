&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am developing a generator and a parser for the
</I>&gt;<i> frequently-discussed-but-never-agreed-on feeds in Gemini format.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to share my code, see your similar code and later discuss
</I>&gt;<i> (over IRC?) what format could work best for our use cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My code:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gemlog generator: <A HREF="gemini://tilde.team/~emilis/Makefile">gemini://tilde.team/~emilis/Makefile</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Aggregator: <A HREF="https://tildegit.org/emilis/gmi-feed-aggregator">https://tildegit.org/emilis/gmi-feed-aggregator</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The motivation (taken from this post:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="gemini://tilde.team/~emilis/2020/11/19-on-feeds-in-gemini-format.gmi">gemini://tilde.team/~emilis/2020/11/19-on-feeds-in-gemini-format.gmi</A>
</I>&gt;<i> ):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I looked through the discussions on Gemini list, read the posts by
</I>&gt;<i> ~ew0k and Drew DeVault.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wholeheartedly disagree with the opinion that Atom/RSS (or JSON
</I>&gt;<i> feeds) should be enough for everybody.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The point is - some of us are not thinking about running feed
</I>&gt;<i> generators, parsers and aggregators on developer laptops,
</I>&gt;<i> workstations, modern servers we own, etc..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are thinking about running these programs on computers where we
</I>&gt;<i> have limited permissions, OpenWRT routers, experimental SBCs, old
</I>&gt;<i> netbooks and rooted phones that cannot be updated to any recent
</I>&gt;<i> distros, etc..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In these situations even Python (widespread as it is) may not be
</I>&gt;<i> available, may be too resource-hungry or may not have the option to be
</I>&gt;<i> updated or extended with libraries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What we need is the ability to process feeds with a bare minimum of
</I>&gt;<i> tools (e.g. a POSIX shell, BusyBox, etc.). Parsing XML and JSON is not
</I>&gt;<i> feasible in these situations.
</I>
With all the due respect, this is a bullshit.  Leaving aside that gemini
requires TLS by the spec, even if you don&#8217;t have root privileges on a
machine, there is a C compiler on it (how you&#8217;re gonna build a shell
without one?), and with that you can build a parser.  (I once wrote a
parser with a friend: a couple of hours of fun pair programming and we
had a JSON parser that was able to parse json objects over a socket,
without blocking etc, and was like ~200-300 lines of c code? &#8212; ok, it
wasn&#8217;t 100% complete and spec compliant, but you get the idea).

anyway&#8230;

&gt;<i> Therefore we want a plain Gemini feed format. Seeing how easy it is to
</I>&gt;<i> generate and parse Gemini files with just plain shell script, makes us
</I>&gt;<i> want it badly. We also have hopes it would have more uses than just
</I>&gt;<i> gemlogging.
</I>
I really like the idea!  A plain (but structured) text/gemini file would
be better IMHO.  It fits the goal of the protocol well: it&#8217;s simple,
effective, usable &#8220;as it is&#8221; without special client support, easy to
generate (and consume) by humans etc&#8230;

&gt;<i> ## What should we do about it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should start by just building the tools for ourselves and
</I>&gt;<i> sharing them (probably on the Gemini list). After we have a few
</I>&gt;<i> implementations, we can discuss on the formal spec between the developers.
</I>
I&#8217;ve just adapted my static site generator to generate a gemini feed.
The commit for it was just &#8220;3 files changed, 26 insertions, 5
deletions&#8221;, as git says.  It&#8217;s hosted here

=&gt; <A HREF="gemini://gemini.omarpolo.com/rss.gmi">gemini://gemini.omarpolo.com/rss.gmi</A>

&gt;<i> The main criteria should probably be the amount of effort and
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge needed to implement a parser.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I found in the discussions is that this may be the lowest common
</I>&gt;<i> denominator at the moment:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ```
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; URL ISO-TIMESTAMP TITLE-MAYBE-WITH-AUTHOR
</I>&gt;<i> ```
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can start from this and agree that our parsers will rely on just
</I>&gt;<i> these lines and ignore the rest for the moment. It could be done by
</I>&gt;<i> this command:
</I>
ignoring anything besides the links can be a good idea.  For instance,
in my feed I&#8217;ve included a title and a quote before the list of feeds:
this can improve the human consumption, but can also let advance clients
to improve the UI: for instance, they could (optionally) extract the
title of the page (the first &#8216;#&#8217; title) and use it as a prefix for the
titles, or improve the search, or &#8230;

&gt;<i> ```
</I>&gt;<i> grep -E '^=&gt;\s*<A HREF="gemini://[^">gemini://[^</A> ]+
</I>&gt;<i> [0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}(T[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}(Z|\+[0-9]{1,2}:[0-9]{2}))?\s+.*$'
</I>&gt;<i> ```
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looking forward to seeing your implementations. Please share them!
</I></PRE>
