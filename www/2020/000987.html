<PRE>Howdy,

It's time to start thinking hard about client certificates.

A super quick introduction for the unaware: everyone is (hopefully!)
familiar with the idea that when you make a TLS connection to a server,
the server provides a certificate (basically a public key plus some
metadata, signed - directly or via a chain - by a trusted third party).
This is supposed to convince you that you've connected to who you think
you have.  What some may not know is that TLS allows clients to send a
certificate to the server as well.  This never (or almost never) happens
on the web, where clients typically authenticate using a username and
password inside a cookie-powered session.

I first learned about client certificates in the murky, distant past
when the &quot;semantic web&quot; was a hot topic, in the context of the
decentralised &quot;Friend Of a Friend&quot; social network idea.  You can read
about FOAF+SSL at <A HREF="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Foaf+ssl.">https://www.w3.org/wiki/Foaf+ssl.</A>

Gemini specs a lot of use for client certificates - partially because
they're a nice tool for the job, partially because the design goal of
maximising power-to-weight ratio means once you accept the weight of
using TLS you'd better implement everything you can using TLS rather
than adding yet another pile of concepts.

The current rough spec fairly clearly outlines two usage scenarios for
client certificates.

One is where you want to restrict access to some Gemini resource to a
limited set of clients, e.g. you want to be able to check a webcam at
your home via Gemini from your office while at work, or via your phone,
but you don't want to open up access to the whole world.  So, you
generate a self-signed certificate on your office computer or your
phone, and manually add its fingerprint to a whitelist on your home
server, and nobody else is allowed in.  This is entirely analogous to
the way many of you are probably familiar with of logging into a server
over ssh using a private key.  It works the same way and has the same
pros/cons (e.g. can't be brute forced, is limited to devices with the
right keys installed).

This is pretty explicitly supported in Gemini via status code 62 to
request such a certificate and 63 to reject one not on the whitelist.
It is actually implemented at <A HREF="gemini://gemini.conman.org/,">gemini://gemini.conman.org/,</A> if you want
to play around with this.

I'm not sure there's much more to consider for this scenario.  Because
in a whitelisting scenario the server and client are typically both
under some degree of control by the same person, people can handle
expiry/renewal however they want and the spec should stay silent on
this.

The second scenario involves transient client certificates.  These are
basically an alternative to cookie-powered sessions in HTTP(S).  A
client generates a self-signed certificate and uses it for some
requests so that the server can recognise consecutive requests as coming
from the same location, and use the certificate fingerprint as a key in
a database to maintain state between requests.  This allows, e.g. using
a long series of status code 10 responses to basically &quot;fill out a
form&quot;, e.g. in signing a guest book there could be separate prompts for
a name, email address or URL, plus guest book comment.  You could
actually build fairly extensive command-line applications using this
paradigm (they'd suck in a graphical browser that kept popping up input
windows, but in something like AV-98 the experience would be a lot
smoother).

Anyway, the appeal of using client certificates for sessions is that:

* They have to be generated by the client and sent to the server,
  instead of the other way around, so they are fundamentally opt-in
* If the client deletes them the server cannot possibly recreate the
  session after recognising the client based on IP address or anything
  else because the private key is gone, so the client can always
  unilaterally opt-out whenever they want
* They are very hard to hi-jack because the private key never travels
  over the network

Compared to cookies they are more secure and put the client in control.

Gemini allows for transient sessions using the 61 and 21 status codes.
61 requests the start of a session, which clients can always refuse to
do.  21 allows servers to signal the termination of a session and
clients should immediately and permanently delete the corresponding
keypair upon receiving it.

Until very recently, I don't think any of this was implemented anywhere.
AV-98 now recognises these codes and reacts appropriately.  I tested it
with a purpose-built dummy server which does nothing but send these
codes.  I am hoping we can soon start to explore this mechanism more,
but there are some things to discuss:

* Some TLS libraries have default values for the various conventional
  fields that go in the &quot;Subject&quot; metadata of the cert - company names,
  countries, states, etc.  These leak information about which TLS
  library the client is using and in this way facilitate a weaker
  version of the dreaded &quot;browser fingerprint&quot;.  Since transient
  certificates are by design supposed to be short lived and in no way
  tied to any permanent notion of identity, it follows that they should
  not have any meaningful metadata associated with them, and therefore
  we should spec something to ensure this.  Right now, AV-98 fills the
  &quot;Subject&quot; of transient certs with random unique values from Python's
  `uuid` module, because I seemed to encounter errors sending totally
  empty certificates to conman.org.  I don't know if the X509 spec
  allows empty certs, and even if it does I don't know whether all
  popular TLS libraries accept them without choking.
* We should specify a fixed validity time for the certificate, again
  because if we don't different clients will do different things and
  certs will become weakly fingerprintable.  AV-98 uses 24 hours, which
  seems reasonable to me.

There is a third scenario, which the spec does not explicitly discuss at
all, but which is actually the most widely used scenario in Geminispace
so far, which is the main reason that I want to kick off a discussion
about this and change the spec if required.  It's the idea of persistent
identity (basically, a &quot;user account&quot;) at a server which is not under
the client's control.  The persistent part differentiates this scenario
from the clearly defined transient certificates, and the lack of
combined control differentiates it from the previously discussed
ssh-style whitelist scenario.  This is exactly the scenario which holds
with the astrobotany.mozz.us application.

Astrobotany currently requires users to generate a CSR for their
certificate, which is submitted to mozz.us over HTTPS, which signs
whatever it sees.  This is cumbersome for the user, and doesn't actually
achieve anything because the signing is done unconditionally.  Everybody
involved agrees this should be done differently.  The reason it turned
out like it has is because of the extreme lack of detail in the cert on
anything to do with client certificates, but with this particular
scenario in particular.

Right now, the spec describes status code 62 (originally intended for
whitelisting scenarios) with &quot;This resource is protected and a client
certificate which the server accepts as valid must be used - a
disposable key/cert generated on the fly in response to this status is
not appropriate as the server will do something like compare the
certificate fingerprint against a white-list of allowed certificates&quot;.
This *could* be relaxed a bit to make it clear that the client *can* try
generating a cert in response to the status, but that the server may not
accept it.  This would allow e.g. astrobotany to send a 62 to a new
user, for the user to generate a non-disposable self-signed cert and
send it back, and for astrobotany to immediatley accept the cert and
connect its fingerprint to a user ID in its database.  This is basically
the smallest possible change to the spec which permits a much more
streamlined version of the way astrobotany currently works.  AV-98 is
ready right now to work with applications using this paradigm.

But, I don't know if it makes more sense to introduce new 6x codes to
explicitly separate this scenario from the whitelisted cert scenario.
If we don't do this, clients may waste time prompting their users to
generate a cert to send to a server which is never going to accept it,
which may confused users.

We could change 62 to specify that the META should be a plain-language
message to users, which could disambiguate the scenario.  Something
else to consider here is that astrobotany uses the Common Name part of
the certificate for the username.  I like this idea a lot, but
different applications may want different or additional user
information, and using META to convey this information could work well.

There is also the open question of how to handle renewal of this kind of
certificate, which people might have need of for years and years.
Applications which a user authenticates to this way could request the
user to provide an email address (which could be validated in the usual
webbish way of sending a <A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> URL with a unique token in it).
Then, once the initial sign-up cert is due to expire soon, the app could
email the user a URL with a unique token in it which they should access
using a new cert, whereupon the new cert's fingerprint should be tied to
the account.  But I'm wary of blindly copying ideas from the web.  This
approach doesn't allow a long term account without associating an email
address, and that sucks from a privacy perspective.

A similar workflow could happen inside the app if somebody &quot;signs in&quot;
close to the expiry date of their cert, which would not require an email
address.  But this doesn't work if you happen not to log in for several
months on either side of the expiry date.

Users could sign their new certificate with their old certificate to
prove continuity, but to some extent this defeats the purpose of
expiring certs in the first place, which is to limit the impact of
private key compromise.

Of course, for very low-stakes applications like Astrobotany - and,
realistically, *all* Gemini applications are likely to be very
low-stakes for the foreseeable future - users could also just &quot;sign up&quot;
with very long-lived certificates.  The CA/Browser Forum disallows certs
that live longer than two years currently, and will apparently soon drop
the limit to one year, but there's no reason we need to listen to them,
especially not in the context of client certificates.

There are probably plenty of relevant things I have not mentioned yet.
Feel free to mention them!

For anybody thinking &quot;Holy heck, this sounds complicated, why are we
putting this in Gemini?&quot; and/or &quot;I sure don't want to write all the code
to do this in my client&quot;:  Client certificates weren't dreamed up for
Gemini, they are a pre-existing part of TLS.  Even if the Gemini spec
didn't say a word about them, people could build applications using them
for authentication without violating the Gemini spec in anyway.  Because
they're very handy things, their eventual use in conjunction with Gemini
is likely inevitable.  Thus, my thinking is that we might as well
standardise on how to use them with Gemini to provide for easier
interoperability and streamlined user experiences.  Also, they are
totally unnecessary for public content like gemlogs, and a client which
does not implement them at all (which is currently the vast majority of
clients) is likely to remain extremely usable for the majority of people
and the majority of purposes.  In fact, to some extent the existence of
popular clients which *don't* handle client certificates would provide a
useful protective measure against people hiding content behind certs
(which, I realise, also facilitate nasty things like &quot;pay walls&quot;)
without a good reason.
