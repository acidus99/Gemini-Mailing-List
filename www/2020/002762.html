<PRE>Hi, all.  Pardon me if this is a little off-topic, it was suggested I
share this here.  I got annoyed at Matrix's complexity and IRC's
idiosyncracies, and said &quot;I wish there were something like Gemini for
chat protocols&quot;.  So I decided to take a weekend and try to make
something like that, and after going over my time budget by a factor of
eight or so I ended up with something I call Scalar: 
<A HREF="https://sr.ht/~icefox/scalar/">https://sr.ht/~icefox/scalar/</A>

It's very WIP still, but there's a minimum viable product specification
and implementation, with much more emphasis on &quot;minimum&quot; than &quot;viable&quot;.
However, it's proof that the idea works, and carrying on the design of
the protocol is pretty straightforward. I can't *quite* bring myself to
design something as hardcore minimalist as Gemini, but I still hope it
meets Gemini's design criteria.  No idea if I will keep working on it
in the immediate future, but maybe it will inspire interesting
discussion.

Thanks a lot,
Simon
