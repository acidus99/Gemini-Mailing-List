Yes, I proposed precisely this along time ago.  It never gained much
traction, but then it's only very useful on top of a client certificate
and *they* are only just now starting to see use, so maybe it's not too
surprising.

I think I will add this to the spec.  It's very little effort for
clients to handle, and it degrades well enough in a client that
treats 11 as 10.  People will probably do the usename/password thing
anyway even without it, so we may as well make it possible to protect
against shoulder surfing.

Cheers,
