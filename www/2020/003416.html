I see no harm in using Atom as a machine readable format, but from my 
point of view the main downside is expecting end users to author it, or 
have the skills to run some command line application to generate it. 
Probably fine for early adopters, but not so good for &quot;normal&quot; users.

Anyway a while back, I wrote a CGI script that emits Atom by parsing 
plain gmi feed listing. Details are here:

<A HREF="gemini://gemini.marmaladefoo.com/blog/2-Jul-2020_GMI_based_feed_generator.gmi">gemini://gemini.marmaladefoo.com/blog/2-Jul-2020_GMI_based_feed_generator.gmi</A>

The parser is in Rebol, but parsing GMI is easy enough in most languages.

If we use raw GMI for feeds, one difficulty perhaps will be how the 
feeds can be discovered, particularly if they have to match some 
specification. But from an end user point of view, GMI is much nicer 
than XML for all the reasons we understand, so I think it is better way 
for authors to express their feed and can be used to generate the XML 
for automated feed clients that need it.
