You can't always give everyone what they want, but this might be an exception. Use date-only on the original post. Use T and time - minute granularity, author is responsible for converting to UTC, no TZ indicator needed or allowed (in the spirit of 'we use this spec, but not all of it') - when referencing a reply. Original posts will always sort ahead of replies, while replies generally sort in order and can be easily removed from a feed
