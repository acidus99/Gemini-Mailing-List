I would think Postels rule should pragmatically apply to line endings in 
the response body, but the spec should definitely be very specific about 
line endings in any headers (as is http). But those are generated by the 
server anyway.

If we force one line ending kind on authors, it will be a deterrent to 
them forging ahead with writing user content if they have to use some 
tool just to be able to get the content onto the server. Look at XHTML, 
it was a resounding failure and rejected by authors even though there 
were some good (and ill conceived) intentions of the spec writers.

Best Wishes
