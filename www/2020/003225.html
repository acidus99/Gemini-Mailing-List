&gt;<i> It's *possible* to serve large files over Gemini. I can make a script that generates a large image (or I can just have a large image to serve). Therefore, you should be able to use Gemini to serve large files. The main draw I can see for a Content-Length header is being able to see if the whole file comes across the wire. The ability to resume an interrupted download need not exist; just retry the request if all of the content doesn't get across.

</I>&gt;<i> That being said, I am wary of making it even a SHOULD. If the file needs it (i.e; it's a big file that probably could get interrupted mid-download), then go ahead, but those of us who don't care about Content-Length or Cache duration shouldn't feel &quot;pressured&quot; to do it.

I'm far from a TLS expert, so I might be completely wrong here, but
can't the client rely on the server's TLS close_notify signal to decide if
the download was interrupted? As far as I can tell, the entire point of
close_notify is to guard against data truncation...?
