</I>
The further discussion of this point has seemed to assume a need to
implement all of troff (and then spun off into LaTeX). I'd like to
propose an alternative: the tiniest subset of it. Specifically:

.I &quot;italic text&quot; optional-suffix optional-prefix

E.g., this contrived example with a poor use of parentheses:

----
&quot;I think we should represent italics
.I &quot;somehow&quot; !&quot;
she said.
.I &quot;After all, this is a medium designed for writing.&quot; ) (
----

would yield (where *this* is italicized):

----
&quot;I think we should represent italics *somehow*!&quot; she said.
(*After all, this is a medium designed for writing.*)
----

As with troff, .I would *not* add line breaks. Unlike troff, this
should *only* have the line-based option, and not the option to make
it apply to all further text until the next line beginning with &quot;.R&quot;.
That does make writing a whole italicized paragraph or page more
cumbersome, but that's a pretty unusual use case.

Incidentally, troff is a topic likely to interest those into gemini:
it's a far more lightweight typesetting system than LaTeX, though it
has its limitations, and like text/gemini it is very much line-based.
It also follows the rule that (almost) any formatting command should
be short and at the start of the line.

Also, I do recognize that this idea is going to get shot down as
paving the way for more extensibility, though we already have things
like verbatim blocks and what have you (which are more esoteric than
italic, so I don't buy the &quot;we shouldn't support every use case&quot;
argument. It's far more common to emphasize words, to write titles of
works, and so forth, than it is to do ASCII art (not that there's
anything wrong with ASCII art; it's great) or present code blocks (the
current demographics of the medium notwithstanding)).

As to using CAPS LOCK as a substitute for italics, that is just not
feasible for anything longer than a word or two.

OBSERVE, AS YOU READ THIS PARAGRAPH, THAT IT IS LESS COMFORTABLE TO
READ THAN ONE WRITTEN WITH STANDARD TYPOGRAPHY. EVEN THE ROMANS
FINALLY GAVE IN AND INVENTED MINISCULE LETTERS FOR THEIR ALPHABET, AND
THAT'S AFTER RESISTING FOR CENTURIES THE IDEA OF EVEN USING SPACES
OR CLAUDIAN DOTS BETWEEN WORDS, SO LITTLE DID THEY CARE ABOUT
READABILITY.

Using *emphasis* is a pretty acceptable solution most of the time, I
think, but it does fall apart a bit with longer passages or titles:
*Doctor Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the
Bomb*, for instance.

Finally, before anybody asks, I would argue that we *don't* need bold
text or bold italic. Bold is rarely used in serious writing; it's used
far more often in graphic design and advertising, neither of which
fields is going to have much fun with gemini, I'm glad to say. If they
were to try, they'd basically just need to serve whole pictures,
anyway.

Just some thoughts on the matter.

Cheers,
Ivy Foster
