<PRE>&gt;<i> Be sure to check out <A HREF="gemini://booksin.space.">gemini://booksin.space.</A> They're working on a more
</I>&gt;<i> curated approach, I think similar to Standard Ebooks, but they'd
</I>&gt;<i> probably appreciate work on tooling.
</I>
I initiated the project a while back, but I've been too busy to actually
work on it. I've been waiting for things to settle down around here, but
I don't know if they are going to haha

Anyone who wants to contribute is more than welcome. I had considered
doing a PG mirror in the past and actually downloaded their archives to
see what it would entail. I think that will be a fun project for John
and for Geminispace in general.

I think Jason is right that booksin.space is/will be more curated, at
least in that its shelves will be populated with books people directly
contribute. Also, I plan to include non-public domain works as well--
things like preprints of academic articles, sheet music, or whatever
other works whose copyright owners allow me to publish them.

If a PG mirror existed in Geminispace, then contributing your favorite
books to booksin.space would as simple as sending me a link :b

Looking forward to seeing more things like this grow in Geminispace (and
also looking forward to having some more time to play here myself!)
