<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Natalie Pendragon once stated:
&gt;<i> For the GUS crawl at least, the crawler doesn't identify itself _to_
</I>&gt;<i> crawled sites, but it does obey blocks of rules in robots.txt files
</I>&gt;<i> according to user-agent. So it works without needing a user-agent
</I>&gt;<i> header.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It obeys user-agent of `*`, `indexer`, and `gus` in order of
</I>&gt;<i> increasing importance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's been some talk of the generic sorts of user-agents in the
</I>&gt;<i> past, which I think is a really nice idea. If `indexer` is a
</I>&gt;<i> user-agent that both sites and crawlers had some sort of informal
</I>&gt;<i> consensus on, then sites wouldn't need to worry about keeping up with
</I>&gt;<i> any new indexers popping up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some other generic user-agent ideas, iirc, were `archiver` and
</I>&gt;<i> `proxy`.
</I>
  That's a decent idea, but that still doesn't help when I want to block a
particular bot for &quot;misbehaving&quot; (in some nebulous way).  For example,
there's this one bot, &quot;The Knowledge AI&quot; which sends requests like

	/%22http:/wesiseli.com/magician/%22 [1]

(and yes, that's an actual example, pulled straight off the log file).  It's
not quite yet annoying enough to block [2] but at least I have some chance
of blocking it via robots.txt (which it does request).  

  -spc

[1]	I can't quite figure out why it includes the quotes as part of the
	link.  *All* the links on my websites look like:

		&lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</A>&quot;&gt;

	and for the most part, it can parse those links correctly.  And
	that's not limited to just *one* bot, but several of them have that
	behavior.

[2]	Although it's nearly impossible to find anything out about it as the
	user-agent string is literally &quot;The Knowledge AI&quot;, so it might be
	worth blocking it just out of spite.
