<PRE>Howdy,

Seek help! :p

Just kidding, welcome to Gemini!
 
&gt;<i> My question is really about how we can support cognitive aspects of user

I understand entirely where you are coming from.  An idea I've had for
a while now (I don't remember if I've mentioned it here before) is that
it would be nice if a graphical Gemini browser used a different
foreground and background colour (and perhaps even a different font?)
for different domains (subdomains)?  This would be something the client
would do itself, with no possibility of control or influence from the
server - it would just use the domain as the seed to a PRNG which chose
a new scheme.  This would then give different sites their own subtly
distinct look and feel, which a user could learn to recognise in time.
I have no idea how feasible this is: programmatically generating
genuinely pleasant colour schemes is certainly not straightforward.
 
&gt;<i> Is there a simple and gemini-friendly way for us to (optionally!) convey
</I>&gt;<i> this sense of place. For example, to set a simple global favicon or
</I>&gt;<i> background colour for pages on a certain site. It could help with user's
</I>&gt;<i> task of navigation and understanding exactly where they are. I know there
</I>&gt;<i> are lots of CLI junkies around here, so maybe this hasn't been a priority so
</I>&gt;<i> far.
</I>
The idea of favicons has been mentioned before in a gemlog post:

<A HREF="gemini://mozz.us/journal/2020-04-17.gmi">gemini://mozz.us/journal/2020-04-17.gmi</A>

I have a couple of big concerns here:

One is that right now Gemini is strictly one-request-per-resource and a
lot of people, myself included, consider that a really desirable
property.  Anything like favicons or CSS would remove that property, no
matter how light weight they were.  It's true that at least the second
request would go to the same server as the first so this doesn't
actually destroy predictability or control of which servers your client
connects to, which is one of the arguments in favour of the one request
thing.

Another is that, philosophically, I kind of feel like styling *should*
be under the control of the client and not the server.  Some people have
strong preferences for light text on dark backgrounds, for example,
because they have problems with eye strain the other way around.  Right
now on the web this is really only possible if the author deigns to
provide the option (as Stack Overflow recently did, to much fanfare).  I
think that's totally backwards.  Give the power over styling to the
people who actually have to read the content, let them read your stuff
in the way that works best for their eyesight and that *they* find
aesthetically pleasing.  I realise this reduces some of the scope for
self-expression on the part of Gemini content authors, but there's more
than enough scope for that in the actual *content* they produce (if not,
there are bigger problems...).

(of course, this is kind of a weak argument against CSS-light in Gemini,
because actually honouring the settings would be optional and clients 
could ignore them and use the user's preferences instead)

The biggest concern is (no surprises to regular readers here!) is that
it's really hard to do this in a way that's not extensible.  With the
best of intentions we'll specify a strictly optional CSS-ultralight
thing which can only choose background and foreground colours from a
small fixed pallette...and then some client will implement one extra
optional feature, and it'll be popular, so then other clients will copy
it, and the whole thing snowballs until people start to think of these
unofficial extensions as a real part of Gemini, and strictly
spec-adherent clients which don't support them as &quot;broken&quot;.  This exact
story happened many times over with the web and I'm terrified of the
same things happening to Gemini.  It's why I've tried at every turn in
this project to avoid adding in anything that feels like it will be
really easy to extend in new directions.

I'm not opposed to hearing ideas, but I have a hard time imagining much
can be done in the way of ultralight optional styling which doesn't
violate the non-extensibility principle.

I'd be much more interested in us exploring innovative possibilities
which are strictly under the control of the client, like keying the
styling to the domain as I mentioned earlier.  I'm not saying that exact
approach necessarily is the best way to do it, or even a good way.  But
it's *a* way to do it which doesn't run afoul of any of the issues above
and that kind of out-of-the-box thinking is a good direction to take,
IMHO.

Hope you're not too disappointed by this response, feel free to
(politely, constuctively!) argue back against any of this.  Thanks for
your interest and welcome to Gemini!

Cheers,
Solderpunk
