<PRE>Hi all,

many thanks for the kind words! :)

</I>
Yes, a Windows installer will be used in a future build, most likely using CMake's CPack module as that it relatively painless and I've done it before in another project.

I'll check the proxy address lookup, I believe it should work with domain names as well.

</I>&gt;<i> It is a beautiful client - congratulations! I especially like how you use a different colour scheme for each domain, and make it clear in the links where you&#8217;re going. The only issue I had was it hangs when I try to navigate to gus.guru (I&#8217;m on a Mac, if that helps).
</I>
I'm mostly developing this on a Mac myself. There is certainly some kind of weirdness with gus.guru, while it works most of the time for me sometimes I have to reload the page manually. Not exactly sure what's going on, will have to investigate. Seems pretty random.

</I>
Yeah, I suppose OpenGL issues can be rather common, especially under VMs. I will add an option to force software rendering in a future build. (See below how to do it manually.)

I have been considering adding a user preference for the enlarged first paragraph, along with other page style customization settings. Could you point me to / share an example page where it looks jarring? Perhaps I can still tweak things a little to detect when not to apply the effect.

Also curious about the block quote appearance, what would you consider a more distinctive appearance?

Hmm, at least it found the resources file, so that's good. My first guess is always that there is some problem with OpenGL. I'll add the software rendering option, but maybe in the meantime you could try going to src/ui/window.c:480 and uncomment &quot;#define ENABLE_SWRENDER&quot;.

Hopefully that helps, but if not, we could try a debug build and run it under gdb to get a stack trace?

It appears `ASN1_TIME_to_tm`  was added to OpenSSL 1.1.1, so I'll document that as a required dependency. If anyone wants to provide a workaround for older OpenSSL releases, I'll gladly accept a patch. :)
