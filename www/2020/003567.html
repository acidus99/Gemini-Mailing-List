<PRE>My emails, afaik, should already be in plaintext. Not sure if something got messed up with a previous email, but anyways.... It shows Plain Text as being selected, so yeah.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Krixano,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A few thoughts. First of all, please use plaintext email in future
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (<A HREF="https://useplaintext.email/#protonmail,">https://useplaintext.email/#protonmail,</A> as your signature clearly indicated you use protonmail I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can give you the direct link). It's easier for a lot of us to access.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regarding your first email:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I want to point out that making the assumption that a lack of robots.txt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is because servers don't mind they're content being archived is a leap in logic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that doesn't actually follow/make sense. A server/user could have just forgotten
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to put a robots.txt, or they could have just not known about it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; A personal example: I didn't have a robots.txt on my capsule file until today, but I don't want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to be included in archives for various reasons. Presuming consent from the lack of a robots.txt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; file would have incorrectly guessed my preference, and harmed my privacy. Who else in that 90% is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; like me? We don't know.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Exactly! When I first got my server up, I didn't have a robots.txt for the longest time. Some of my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; content was actually not supposed to be archived because it was dynamic stuff. And other stuff I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; didn't necessarily want archived.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It may be a leap of logic, sure, but it's the same leap of logic that has been all but codified as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; law (see court cases like Field v. Google, where judges have determined that not including a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; robots.txt or no-archive tag grants an implied license to archive). As stated in the case summary of Field v. Google:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Author granted operator of Internet search engine implied license to display &quot;cached&quot; links to web pages containing his copyrighted works when author consciously chose not to include no-archive meta-tag on pages of his website, despite knowing that including meta-tag would have informed operator not to display &quot;cached&quot; links to his pages and that absence of meta-tag would be interpreted by operator as permission to allow access to his web pages via &quot;cached&quot; links.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Google's &quot;cached&quot; pages system is essentially an archive under a different name. Is it truly a leap of logic if even a court of law comes to the same decision?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'm not sure why Internet Archive matters here. Just because they do something doesn't mean
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it's the right thing to do. Seems like an appeal to authority to me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is an appeal to authority, but not a fallacious one. The Internet Archive is (as far as I know)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the biggest archiving group on the Internet. If they do something, it's not entirely beyond reason
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to assume other people do the same. A wide variety of people who do archiving that I've spoken to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have the same attitude: they'll still archive it, but they won't make the archive available to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; public if they aren't supposed to.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; One more thing I want to point out... copyright law isn't opt-in. It's opt-out.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If you don't have a copyright statement or any other licensing information,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; then &quot;all rights reserved&quot; is automatically assumed, afaik. You can't just copy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; something just because the author didn't explicitly disallow you from doing that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, see above; the law is on the side of the person assuming robots.txt is a system for opting out of indexing/archiving/etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just my two cents,
