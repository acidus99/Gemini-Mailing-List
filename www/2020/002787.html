Of course it's somewhat breaking away from a paradigm, but I strongly feel

In practice, given the existence of doi.org and similar systems, as well as
URL shorteners (I often use them to generate de facto URNs), and the fact
that HTTP and Gemini both allow protocol-level redirection, I think what we
have is as good as it's going to get.  DNS is the most successful and
widespread federated database system in the world, and attempting to
replace it is likely to be a pipe dream.  Link rot is a thing, but so is
database rot and protocol rot.  As the French proverb has it, &quot;tout passe,
tout lasse, tout casse et tout se remplace&quot; (Everything passes, everything
grows weary, everything breaks, and everything gets replaced).

And I say this as a person who has dealt with SGML/XML public ids and URNs,
and even wrote RFC 3305 to define a mapping from the former to the latter.
It's a dead end.  Of course, I'm certainly open to the idea that my
conclusions were premature, but the burden of persuasion is on you.  I know
the merits of stable names, you needn't convince me of that.  You need at
least a sketch of a system that is clearly superior to URLs as we know them
today.
