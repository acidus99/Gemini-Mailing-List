I'm suggesting only a bare bones, dead simple, worse-is-better,
get-what-you-can-with-what's-on-hand version of syndication. I would
just collect all links on the page and not devise an intelligent way to
filter them, as if we were scraping web pages for only the good stuff. I
agree that would lead to divergent behavior among clients.

So let it be just the simplest possible implementation. The upgrade path
to a nicer experience would be for the author to publish RSS or Atom in
order to select just the right links for readers.

&gt;<i> It is a great idea, but I think we could instead write a script or a

</I>&gt;<i> Or we could just use gemfeed to generate Atom for us.
</I>
Generating Atom et al is the kind of thing many Gemini authors are
already doing (like me!), and those folks certainly don't need to worry
about this idea. When a feed is offered, I think users will prefer to
use it.

But if this takes off, new authors who haven't taken the step of
generating a feed will be more tied into the conversation already. For
instance, I was not going to get any blog replies or readership until I
did the work to publish Atom so I could then submit to CAPCOM. An 80%
solution would have helped me get engaged as a newcomer. It would also
help future users as Gemini's audience slowly broadens to include a less
technical crowd.

One more benefit for us early adopters: If we lower the barrier to entry
for others, it will mean more content for us to read and engage with.
