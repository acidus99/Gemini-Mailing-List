Thanks for sharing your project!

Somewhat like I said in my earlier post responding to the announcement
of Geddit, it will be really interesting to see whether or not this kind
of thing takes root in Geminispace, where it's comparatively difficult
(compared to the web) to control spam without making the user jump
through hoops (nobody is going to want to generate a client certificate
for each gemlog they might want to comment on).

Commenting is very rare in Gopherspace, although it is possible and you
occassionally see it.  By convention people respond either by just
emailing the author or by writing a response post of their own.  I have
read many people say that they really like this, because it encourages a
more carefully thought out and long form response than a comment.  Of
course, this second option (writing a response) only really works
because Gopherspace is small enough that there is a high likelihood of
the original poster finding your response.  It works well within small
communities, but does not scale.  Since Gemini does a very good job of
addressing just about all of the small irritations that people tend to
notice in Gopher, I am kind of hoping that it grows to be larger than
Gopherspace, and as such this cherished norm might break down.

In my experience the email thing works well, and lends Gopherspace a
very personal feel, which I enjoy.  That, too, might break down if email
address harvesting robots penetrate Geminispace in the future and people
don't want to put their address on their &quot;about&quot; page.

Who knows how things will pan out here.  I'd be kind of sad to see the
rise of a third-party Disqus-style solution here in Geminispace, but of
course I'm powerless to stop it.

Sorry if I sound down on all these cool new commenting and link-sharing
projects, I don't mean to me!  I'm really happy to see people pouring
energy and into Geminispace projects.  I'm just really curious to see
how all of this pans out in the longer term.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
