Thanks for the reminder!  The SNI issue was addressed and this is now
mentioned in the spec.  The status codes related to client certificates
were also simplified and &quot;transient certificates&quot; are no longer a
first-class concept in the spec.  I *think* those were the major issues
that a little real-world experience revealed, and that they are both now
resolved.

Hmm.  While I agree that neither servers nor clients really need
permission to implement basic functionality like timeouts, this
particular case *does* raise some questions.  Currently it seems
implicit in the spec that servers may not say anything until the client
has finished sending a request.  In principle, there are circumstances
where a server might know what it wants to do before that point - an
invalid URL (triggering a status code 59 response) might be detected
before it is complete, and the n-th request within m seconds (triggering
a status code 44 response) can be detected before *anything* is
received.  And, as you point out, reasonable defensive timeouts can
occur before a request is complete.  Is a server obligated to wait for a
complete response before saying anything?

Thanks for bringing this up, I'll think about it.  Thoughts are welcome.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
