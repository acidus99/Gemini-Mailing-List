</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Bh&#237; teip ann an cl&#225;r a chur i bhfeidhm
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would you even know what language to translate from?
</I>

If a client would receive such a status it would reply to the user:
&quot;server error: invalid protocol&quot;.  Why?  Because I'm not advocating
for &quot;any sequence of ASCII characters&quot;, but a predefined (thus limited
and known) list of tokens that are accepted.


More clearly, there are two separate issues:
* the syntax -- one digit, vs two digits, vs any number of digits, vs
ASCII tokens, etc. -- i.e. the serialization of an error condition;
* the semantic -- be it `2`, `200`, `success` -- i.e. how many
different &quot;response&quot; classes do we want to specify;




&gt;<i> &gt; * `2` not found / gone;  (i.e. the server is working fine, but what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you are searching for does not exist at the moment;  perhaps it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; existed in the past, perhaps later it will exist;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   There is a distinction between &quot;gone&quot; and &quot;not found&quot;.  &quot;Gone&quot; means &quot;it
</I>&gt;<i> was once here, but has since been removed, please stop referencing this
</I>&gt;<i> resource&quot; (i.e. &quot;remove it from your bookmarks file&quot;), while &quot;not found&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> means just that---it's not here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I mentioned to solderpunk that I wish gopher had a &quot;gone&quot; message (along
</I>&gt;<i> with redirect, which I'll get to below), since there is a good reason to
</I>&gt;<i> mark something as &quot;gone&quot; and not just &quot;not found&quot;.
</I>

I understand the &quot;philosophical&quot; distinction between &quot;gone&quot; and &quot;not
found&quot;;  but how often have you encountered a web server that properly
responds with &quot;gone&quot;?  Or, given that many `<A HREF="gemini://`">gemini://`</A> servers will be
static servers using the file-system, how would one &quot;know&quot; if a
selector refers to a &quot;gone&quot; file?




&gt;<i> &gt; * `3` redirect;  neither temporary nor permanent; (because in fact
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there isn't a clear definition and usage of temporary vs permanent;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   A valid reason for a temorary redirect might be to redirect users to the
</I>&gt;<i> most current resource available, say, a specification.  A base link like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One can always link directly to a specific version, but the current will
</I>&gt;<i> *always* be found at a known location.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   The actions are the same, but the semantics are different.
</I>

I think that if one would apply a case-by-case analysis, one could
find better solutions.

For example in your documentation case, how about instead of
redirecting we present an `text/gemini` resource that provides a short
summary, a link to the current version, and a list of links to
previous versions.

I would say it makes more sense because:
* the user isn't surprised anymore by the redirect, and is aware that
there are multiple versions;
* in order for older versions to be indexed by a crawler, we always
need such a &quot;links page&quot;, thus why not make proper use of it;

Ciprian.
