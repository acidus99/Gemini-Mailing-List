There's no reason they *should*, but they can.  And some of them will.
And then people will think of this as normal and expect it and design
their documents around it, and the snowball will roll...

I tried *so* hard to avoid this, but you just can't.  This <A HREF="data://">data://</A> URL
thing is a monster.  No RFC puts a limit on the allowed length of a URL.
And the <A HREF="data://">data://</A> scheme includes MIME types.  So they are a vehicle for
arbitrary content of arbitrary size.  Turns out this entire time Gemini
- and even it's hypothetical deliberately stripped-back cousin Mercury -
has allowed embedding of inline images, audio and videos.  It's just
impossible to avoid this stuff unless you throw out URLs entirely and
start with something else, in which case the effort to learn the spec
and implement it skyrockets because you can't leverage existing
knowledge and code.  I was naive to think the internet was made out of
little do-one-thing-and-do-it-well components you could compose in novel
ways to build things of deliberately limited scope.  Turns out it's made
of a few massively overpowered blobs and it's impossible to build
anything small.

Yes, alright, to some extent abuse of this loophole will be limited by
the fact that all this content has to be downloaded in a single file in
a single transaction before any of it can be displayed, so the user
experience will be miserable if there is more than just a little bit of
embedded content.  We won't quite end up as bad as the web.  But still!
This is just unspeakably frustrating.

Cheers,
