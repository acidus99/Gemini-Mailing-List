<PRE>It's funny, when I first looked at gemini, it sparked my interest as an 
idea of a wiki scheme, just implementing the initial dream of interwiki 
as a protocol, so every page is a wiki page, with some sort of native 
markup, connected to other pages, which would all be wikis.

I was disabused of that notion when I realized, after reading a bunch of 
email digests, that the final spec for links was not in-line at all, and 
the idea was to make gopher that was less annoying (ok, it's annoying to 
me, I quit after initial phlogging because of gophermaps). But man, I 
love a simple wiki mark-up (# * ```, =&gt;)!

So, I got caught up in this mini-reprise of the initial days of the www, 
though, it is so cool that most of the gemini content can't be gotten 
unless you have a gemini browser!  So I let go of the wiki dream, and got 
into this new world of simple text.

In this www-reprise model, lots of extra stuff is being proposed, it seems 
to me, and at some point, one has to ask, why not use http if you are 
going to decorate with all the http things? One answer is, of course, is 
that old, unfancy http seems lame and dated (looks at SDF tutorial pages), 
which is valid. That stuff is not exciting.

And so now, seeing all this wiki talk, I'm excited again by the idea of a 
wiki protocol, but at the same time, I feel like it really should be a 
different project. It's not what gemini is.

If we are turning this into a wiki protocol, why don't we have inline 
links and all the cool markup available to make nice documents (TOCs, 
etc), and versioning and all that?
