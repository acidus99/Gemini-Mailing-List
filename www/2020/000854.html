I don't think it's viable for interactive user clients (especially light
and simple ones) to attempt this, but in the context of, say, a search
engine which really wants to categorise everything (which is not to say
that GUS necessarily has to shoulder this burden!), even distinguishing
languages with the same alphabet is possible by looking at bigram and
trigram frequencies if there's enough text.  German text will have many
more occurences of &quot;lich&quot; and &quot;heit&quot; than French or Spanish, etc.
 
&gt;<i>   Nice idea, but there are some tough issues to address.

Yeah, this language proposal may have been poorly categorised as &quot;quick
and easy&quot; compared to the others.

Cheers,
