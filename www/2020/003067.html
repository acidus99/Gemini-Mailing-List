I will check myself, but I don't think most clients would throw up when
faced with input like this.  I thought it's a common way to present
multi-line input prompts.  If it's not, that's also fine, but I don't
see this being so big of an issue that the spec needs to be changed.

Most 'proper' clients (i.e. not shell scripts) should have absolutely no
problem dealing with this.  Shell scripts will certainly have to be wary
with assuming it's a single line, but even then, no biggie.  Perhaps we
can provide this as a Gemini torture test (if it isn't already one), as
I know many clients do check against that.
