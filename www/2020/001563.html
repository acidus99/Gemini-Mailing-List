  Yes.

</I>
  To answer that last question, no.

  To explain, let me explain my setup.  GLV-1.12556 allows one to use
multiple directories per virtual host for content.  I have the following
set up on my development box:

      {
        path      = &quot;^(/cgi%-bin/)(.*)&quot;, -- [5]
        module    = &quot;GLV-1.handlers.filesystem&quot;,
        directory = &quot;/home/spc/projects/gemini/non-checkin/cgi-bin&quot;,
        -- ... there are some other directives, not important right now
      },

      {
        path      = &quot;.*&quot;, -- [5]
        module    = &quot;GLV-1.handlers.filesystem&quot;,
        directory = &quot;/home/spc/projects/gemini/non-checkin/lucy.roswell.area51&quot;,
        -- ... more directives ...
      }

Note that depending upon how things are configured, CGI [1] can be in any
directory or restricted to a single directory [2].  With GLV-1.12556, any
file with the 'execute' bit will be treated as a CGI script [3][4].  I just
added a CGI to my main Gemini server:

	<A HREF="gemini://gemini.conman.org/test/a-script/foobar?one=1&amp;two=2">gemini://gemini.conman.org/test/a-script/foobar?one=1&amp;two=2</A>

the URL is broken up:

	location =
	{
	  host = &quot;gemini.conman.org&quot;,
	  port = 1965.000000,
	  path = &quot;/test/a-script/foobar&quot;,
	  scheme = &quot;gemini&quot;,
	  query = &quot;one=1&amp;two=2&quot;,
	}

the path is matched against each handler's path (in order, first match wins)
and the matching one is handed the request.  Per the configuration, this
match result will be:

	match =
	{
	  &quot;/&quot;,
	  &quot;test/a-script/foobar&quot;,
	}

  The filesystem handler will breakdown the second match element (the first
is considered the &quot;URL filesystem space&quot;---remember, GLV-1.12556 supports
multiple directories per vhost) and check each segment (for permissions, CGI
script or SCGI script).  So the first check is for:

	&lt;directory&gt; .. &quot;test&quot;

  This is a directory, so it continues, walking down the path.   Next it
tries:

	&lt;directory&gt; .. &quot;test/&quot; .. &quot;a-script&quot;

  This is a file with the execute bit set, so it's run.  The rest of the
match is used to construct the PATH_INFO

	PATH_INFO=&quot;/foobar&quot;

and PATH_TRANSLATED

	PATH_TRANSLATED=&lt;directory&gt; .. &quot;/foobar&quot;

This does not imply that such a directory exists.  If there is no more to
the path (say, the request was to &quot;/test/a-script&quot;) then the PATH_INFO and
PATH_TRASLATED would not be set.

  A Gemini server doesn't have to do what I do.  It is certainly in line
with Apache to require CGI scripts to have a particular extension, look for
said extension and handle things that way without having to walk down the
filesystem checking each component.  So hypothetically speaking, a request
like:

	<A HREF="gemini://example.net/foo/bar.cgi">gemini://example.net/foo/bar.cgi</A>

the server can scan for &quot;.cgi&quot;, find it, know it's going to execute a CGI
script, but there is nothing more of the URL path, so not set PATH_INFO and
PATH_TRANSLATE.  But for this:

	<A HREF="gemini://example.net/foo/bar.cgi/baz">gemini://example.net/foo/bar.cgi/baz</A>

find the .cgi extension, extract the path up through the extension
(&quot;/foo/bar.cgi&quot;) and because there's more, set up PATH_INFO and
PATH_TRANSLATE.  There's another message on this list where I give a real
life example where I use PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED here:

	<A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/001485.html">https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/001485.html</A>

&gt;<i> Semi-related: when the server forks off the CGI process, is it
</I>&gt;<i> conventional to set that process' working directory to the CGI bin?
</I>
  It would be conventional to set the working directory to the main
directory for the host.  In my case, given that a host can have multiple
directories, I set the working directory to the handler's directory setting. 
That value is also set in GEMINI_DOCUMENT_ROOT.

  -spc

[1]	And SCGI, I support this as well.

[2]	That's why I have 'cgi-bin'---to test that configuration.

[3]	I didn't bother with extensions for this.  I felt that checking for
	the 'execute' bit was more elegant than just an extension.  Also, if
	CGI has been disabled (server wide, host or directory---the
	configuration is very fine grained) then I return an error to the
	client.

[4]	There's another method for SCGI.

[5]	This is a Lua style regex.  The patterns in () are groupings and the
	filesystem handler wants two groups---the first is the leading
	portion in URL space that doesn't map to a file system, the second
	is the portion that does map to a filesystem.  The original syntax
	for this only required one match and I kept that---in that case, the
	match is redone slightly so that the leading '/' from the URL
	portion is the first match, then the rest.  So the '.*' pattern
	(which is basically &quot;match all&quot;) becomes the pattern &quot;^(/)(.*)&quot;. 
	This is an implementation detail of GLV-1.12556, but I thought I
	should mention it.
