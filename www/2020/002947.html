<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Kevin Sangeelee once stated:
&gt;<i> It was consequently queried by the Kind and Honourable Sean Conner:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  How?  Given that a redirection loop can exist across servers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The link '/test/redirhell/' generates some unique hex for each new redirect
</I>&gt;<i> path, which could alternatively have the hex preserved across redirects,
</I>&gt;<i> but with a counter that's incremented instead. If the counter exceeds, say
</I>&gt;<i> 11428, then return a '50 YOU ARE DRIVING ME NUTS' response code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I understand it, the redirhell test redirects back to itself, not across
</I>&gt;<i> servers - my reply was more in sympathy with your server than with the
</I>&gt;<i> unrelenting client. 
</I>
  It wasn't &quot;driving me nuts&quot; as in &quot;oh my God!  My server is melting under
the load!&quot; but more of a &quot;oh, it looks like someone wrote an automated
client and didn't limit redirections.&quot;  Yes, I'll see clients being tested
and get caught in the Redirection Hell test, but those tend to make perhaps
a few dozen requests before stopping.  It was clear to me that the author of
the particular client didn't test for infinite redirections, and the only
way I can bring the issue up is on the mailing list.

&gt;<i> I'm grateful for your implement of torture, it's been very useful!
</I>
  You're welcome.  If you can think of any other tests that might be
helpful, please don't hesitate to let me know.
