</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think it would be helpful to quote the spec here:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Use of alt text is at the client's discretion, and simple clients may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ignore it. Alt text is recommended for ASCII art or similar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; non-textual content which, for example, cannot be meaningfully
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; understood when rendered through a screen reader or usefully indexed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; by a search engine. Alt text may also be used for computer source code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to identify the programming language which advanced clients may use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for syntax highlighting.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Alt text is recommended for, and I think named after, the role of alt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; text in HTML&lt;img&gt;. That is, to be an alternative representation of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; content, like &quot;Photograph of a woman on a horse&quot;. In that sense it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; meant to be text that users see! Just not every user in all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; circumstances. HTML&lt;img&gt;  alt text is meant in part for users that use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; screen readers, but users nonetheless. So I would prefer we not go
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; adding extensions to alt text that prevent it from being always
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; human-readable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Refer to the alt attribute as documented here:)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Img">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Img</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The advanced use case cited in the spec matches the way in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GitHub-flavored Markdown you can write ```typescript to get TypeScript
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; syntax highlighting. While not an alternative content representation,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that is at least human-readable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whilst a reference to the HTML spec is interesting, we are defining Gemini
</I>&gt;<i> here, so the Gemini spec isn't beholden to HTML.
</I>
To be clear, I'm not saying we are beholden to HTML. But it is the basis
for the spec's vocabulary: In this case &quot;alt text&quot; is a term from HTML.
I'm pointing to HTML's &lt;img&gt; alt attribute because that's what I believe
Solderpunk was talking about when the spec mentioned &quot;alt text&quot;. I think
that, and the text of the spec (&quot;Alt text is recommended for&#8230;&quot;), support
the notion that human-readable alternative content representation is the
primary point of the field.

&gt;<i> The spec mentions both applications of the tail of the &quot;mode switch line&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (to avoid a normative gloss), both as an alt text and to identify the
</I>&gt;<i> programming language. So this duality is already envisaged in the spec.
</I>
It does, but my next point was that this two-uses-for-one-field
situation creates conflict between the uses with negative consequences
for users. It would be better regarded as a mistake in the spec worth
amending.

&gt;<i> &gt; Really, I think what we have here is a field with two possible uses that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are at cross purposes, one for people and one for machines. Syntatically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's based on something in Markdown that's for machine use, but it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recommended for the human use. But the whole idea of it being for human
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use is spoiled by the fact that it will grate on humans in cases when it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is not for their use.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would rather the spec either make a call and pick one purpose, or omit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the field entirely, rather than leaving this conflict unresolved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I prefer that the spec allows for multiple uses. Primarily it is a label for
</I>&gt;<i> human benefit, but that is not to say it cannot be comprehended by a
</I>&gt;<i> machine.
</I>
I hear you, but I don't see how that addresses the problem create for
users by having the field work two ways.

&gt;<i> This sort of relates to the other thread on the ML right now - about whether
</I>&gt;<i> there could be a feed format based on gemtext - it would be based on certain
</I>&gt;<i> conventions in the use of the format, without breaking gemtext at all.
</I>
As I understand it, a feed format based on Gemtext would be usable as a
plain Gemtext page by a plain browser, which is great. And for a feed
aggregator to use it as a subscription mechanism, you'd have to
formalize some piece of it. All of that sounds OK for that purpose.

But in this thread, I think we're talking interpreting Gemtext alt text
differently, not for a special kind of client, but in regular
user-facing interactive browsers. And not on special documents like
feeds, but in general purpose Gemtext pages.

I think that difference makes these two cases not comparable. Adding
Gemtext-compatible formality for feed pages has no effect on other
Gemtext pages. Adding accessibility-incompatible formality for all
Gemtext pages could have a negative effect on particular users across
Gemini as a whole.

&gt;<i> I don't see how the spec can mandate the content that is in an informative
</I>&gt;<i> part of the content -i.e. a label on an element.
</I>
I think what the spec can do is make a clearer recommendation. Maybe
we'd have two fields and they wouldn't have to step on each other's
toes.
