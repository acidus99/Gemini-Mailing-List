I'm aware that this is a very contentious point, but just to throw a
wrench into things...there actually is [an RFC precedent][rfc1341] for
including size as a parameter to a MIME type, even though MIME type is
generally intended to be a classification. Granted, it's intended
specifically for external message bodies, so the user can decide
whether it's worth their while to download...but isn't an external
message body ultimately what any arbitrary file you fetch is anyway?

[rfc1341]: <A HREF="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1341">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1341</A>

I totally get it if the answer's still no to a size parameter; the
&quot;where does it end?&quot; argument is a strong one. However, a precedent
for including a very useful piece of information as a MIME type
parameter is still something to consider.

Cheers,
Ivy
