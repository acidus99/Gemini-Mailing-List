<PRE>In the CR, LF , and CRLF debate I find myself in favor of 
not worrying about the relic that is CR only. No modern systems use this
and as a new protocol I dont see a compelling reason to support ancient systems.
Particularly given that even among ancient systems just a CR as a line ending
was a rarity.

(The below quote has been edited to provide the character that was actually
meant, per solderpunk's later post):
&gt;<i> Bombadillo and Castor (an old build of Castor I had lying around,
</I>&gt;<i> admittedly) both handled LF and CRLF fine, but did not split CR lines at
</I>&gt;<i> all.  
</I>
Bombadillo should be able to handle two of the three. For dealing with lines
I split on newline and remove trailing whitespace from all lines when rendering.
Bombadillo will also never render a `\r` character (the line wrapping parses them
out of the render for display purposes). I imagine Castor and Asuka are doing 
something vaguely similar.


&gt;<i> Some quick experimentation with Python revealed that str.splitlines()
</I>&gt;<i> is, indeed, smart enough to handle CRLF, CR and LF as linebreaks.
</I>
That _is_ pretty cool that the python method was able to detect \r line endings
and split them though. Points to python on that one.
