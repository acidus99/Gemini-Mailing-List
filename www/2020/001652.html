You're probably right.

&gt;<i> 1. Open servers are *attacked* at an alarming rate. At home, I run an
</I>&gt;<i> sshd instance tha is open to the Internet [2].  I am currently
</I>&gt;<i> blocking 2,520 hosts that have attempted to log in via ssh.  That
</I>&gt;<i> count is only over the past 30 days (technically, 30 days, 10 hours,
</I>&gt;<i> 30 minutes, as that's the average month length over the year).  Not
</I>&gt;<i> doing so means my machine will be constantly under login attempts.
</I>
I'm finding this out the hard way. Fortunately I thought to disable
root logins in /etc/ssh/sshd_config when I first set up my VPS, but I'm
also reading up on fail2ban. Thinking of using this HOWTO since it
emphasizes not tampering with distributed config files.

<A HREF="https://phrye.com/tools/fail2ban-on-freebsd/">https://phrye.com/tools/fail2ban-on-freebsd/</A>

&gt;<i> And then there's the *wierd* (and quite stressful) situations
</I>&gt;<i> involving black-hat hackers [5].
</I>
You know what? I think I recognize your email because I've read about
your experience with the black-hat.

I'm reading this email and thinking, &quot;Dear creeping gods, what have I
gotten myself into?&quot;

&gt;<i> 2. If people could run a business server on their home connection,
</I>&gt;<i> they would. ... Never mind the power is out, why did my
</I>&gt;<i> server loose connection?
</I>
I've been this clueless. Fortunate my phone wasn't working so I
couldn't inflict it on some poor tech support worker.

&gt;<i>   Or in self defense, the ISP cuts the connection because the home
</I>&gt;<i> server is running a port scanner, participating in a botnet, or
</I>&gt;<i> sending out spam emails because of an unpatched exploit in some
</I>&gt;<i> server being run at home.
</I>

You're right, this is legit.
 
&gt;<i> 3. Do people realize they'll need to basically firewall off their
</I>&gt;<i> Windows boxes?
</I>
I firewalled the hell out of my wife's Windows machine just to block
the damn telemetry. It's insane.

&gt;<i> 4. It was email that poisoned home-run servers intially.
</I>
I remember this now. I know there was a reason I was reluctant to even
try setting up external email on tanelorn.city. I thought I was just
being irrational.

&gt;<i> That is true too, but I suspect even *if* you could easily run a
</I>&gt;<i> server at home, 99% would not even bother (or know what it is).
</I>
Fair point.
 
&gt;<i> Never underestimate the lack of giving a damn the general
</I>&gt;<i> population have. I'm sure there are aspects of your life that you
</I>&gt;<i> lack a damn about that other people think you should give more than a
</I>&gt;<i> damn.
</I>
You're right. It's just that I see barriers and had forgotten that some
of the barriers exist for a reason.

&gt;<i> I think it's a conversation worth having, as it relates to how
</I>&gt;<i> Gemini expands with new content.
</I>
Thanks for taking the time to reply. There's a lot here that I either
didn't know or had forgotten.
