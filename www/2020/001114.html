Hey Ben, wonderful to hear this!  The broad support for Gemini coming
out of the tilde/pubnix scene makes me really happy.

&gt;<i> - registration on tildegit is whitelisted to tilde email addresses (namely

</I>
Aaah, is *that* what's happened?  I've heard a few people mention not
being able to register an account, but couldn't see why not with a quick
check.  Was it always like this (I guess I wouldn't have noticed, using
an @sdf.org address), or was this done in response to abuse problems?

I get that tildegit is intended to serve the tildeverse so in some ways
this restriction makes perfect sense.  It's kind of a shame, though, for
&quot;outsiders&quot; to not be able to open issues, make pull requests, etc. :(

Cheers,
Solderpunk
