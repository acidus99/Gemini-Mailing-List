<PRE>&gt;<i> I also set up a mailing list on Sourcehut (like, just now) to leave
</I>&gt;<i> comments.  I've linked the mailing list at the bottom of my weblog
</I>&gt;<i> entries,
</I>
Thinking about it, I should do that too.

&gt;<i> One last question: Gemininauts (please oh please let that be a word)
</I>&gt;<i> with twinlogs, how do you decide what to cross-post and what to keep
</I>&gt;<i> {WWW,gemini,gopher}-exclusive? I'm leaning towards keeping my weblog
</I>&gt;<i> more &quot;professional&quot; and my gemlog less filtered, [...] I'm curious
</I>&gt;<i> to know how you all handle this.
</I>
I separate my posts into three (for now, at least) categories, being
&quot;experiments&quot;, &quot;posts&quot; and &quot;micro logs&quot;.

Experiments are where I mess around with Gemini/Gemtext, so it only
makes sense for them to be Gemini-exclusive.

&quot;Micro Logs&quot; are stuff I post every now and then that contain
(sometimes multiple) short posts that I feel are too short for normal
posts. These are also Gemini-exclusive.

&quot;Posts&quot;, are the (somewhat) more polished stuff I write. They are
accessible via HTTP &quot;by default&quot;, but for some stuff I will intentionally
make them Gemini-exclusive, depending on their content.

(I also have &quot;reply&quot; posts (just one for now). They are also
Gemini-exclusive by nature)

&quot;Posts&quot; are actually special, in that they will always have HTML versions
available, even if not listed. This was originally a bug until I decided
it could be great for sharing and turned it into a feature.

Everything I talked about also gets uploaded into a public Git repo and
both versions of the site get built from the same sources, with HTML
being the &quot;afterthought&quot; (All posts are written in Gemtext)

&gt;<i> leaving the shortest bits for the Fediverse.
</I>
I have a CGI script to show the most recent (20 i think) fediverse
messages I posted as Gemtext. It might be useful for you too, assuming
you can run Python CGI scripts in your server:

<A HREF="https://git.ebc.li/admicos/blog/src/branch/main/cgi/thoughts.py">https://git.ebc.li/admicos/blog/src/branch/main/cgi/thoughts.py</A>

It should work on any reasonably modern version of Python assuming
`requests` is installed.
