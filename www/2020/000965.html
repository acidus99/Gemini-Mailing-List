&gt;<i> Isn't CRLF a DOS/Windows thing? Why use it at all?
</I>
It's not often I'll say anything that might be perceived as &quot;sticking up
for Microsoft&quot; in the context of storing text (I mean, really, Office
*still* doesn't use UTF-8 by default, and Excel uses different
delimiters in .csv files depending on the OS locale, making cross-locale
file exchange a pain), but we really shouldn't demonise them for using
CRLF (this is mostly in response, just to be clear, to a HN comment
calling CRLF something like &quot;a Microsoft abomination&quot;.

It's true Windows is the only place using CRLF these days, but it's not
like the rest of the world has always use plain old LF and MS decided to
be different just for the sake of different.  DOS inherited CRLF from
CP/M, and Windows is just the &quot;last man standing&quot; from a long CRLF
tradition dating back to the days of physical teletypes, and which
included systems with a lot more geek street cred, like DEC's TOPS-10
and RT-11.

IETF's decision to use CRLF as the canonical form (which was apparently
mostly driven by Postel, according to
<A HREF="https://www.rfc-editor.org/old/EOLstory.txt">https://www.rfc-editor.org/old/EOLstory.txt</A>) was a perfectly sensible
one at the time, when plain CR was also in use (on Macs, LISP machines
and many 8-bit home microcomputers), as it guaranteed lines would always
get split.

Anyway, I've made a deicision on this which, I'll post shortly.

Cheers,
