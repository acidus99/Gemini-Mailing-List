Whilst I think it is nice to support a practice of source code language 
labelling (to assist syntax highlighting), I think it would be 
insufficient to cover current usage practice.

In particular, I'm thinking of ANSI markup that some authors sprinkle in 
their content.

ANSI codes are effectively platform-specific formatting instructions 
(for example foreground, background colours) that are unique to a 
terminal type client.

If authors wish to use these in preformatted regions, they really should 
be hinting this to the client so that the client can take appropriate 
steps to render (or ignore) the terminal ANSI codes. The interpretation 
of these terminal escape codes is not treating the content as plain 
text, but rather to take a particular content interpretation, to drive 
the visual UI. Similar to embedded &lt;font&gt; tags, you might say.

So this in itself suggests the need to be able to hint at content-type 
in the preformatted region.

e.g.

```text/x-ansi
(ANSI marked up content in color etc)
``

(or perhaps ```content-type: text/x-ansi to label it correctly)

Or are we going to say these implementation terminal escape codes are 
left as an ad-hoc convention? That seems to have its own risks as 
discussed on this thread and elsewhere.

Best Wishes
