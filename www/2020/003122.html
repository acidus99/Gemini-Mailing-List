<PRE>Does anyone have any concerns about amending the spec to state that a TLS
close_notify message should be sent before closing the TCP connection?
While TLS guarantees the integrity of the data from the server, it does
not guarantee completeness until a close_notify is received by the client.
Interested and able clients could then determine that they received a
complete response.

The sending of close_notify is discussed in section 6.1 of RFC 8446 [1].

This approach was previously discussed on the list by Michael Lazar and
solderpunk [2] [3] and kooda [4].

I have been testing various software and configurations to find out the
feasibility of this approach. The ability to send close_notify is part of
the TLS 1.2 and 1.3 specs, and is widely available for server authors to
use. The OpenSSL C library provides the SSL_shutdown function which sends
close_notify. The LibreSSL C library has had the same function since its
first release. The libtls library included with LibreSSL provides this
functionality in the tls_close function. I've verified the effectiveness of
Python's SSLSocket.unwrap method. Ruby seems to handle this with
SSLObject.sysclose and Go with the Close method in crypto/tls/conn.go.

Every TLS 1.2 or 1.3 client I've seen will automatically handle TLS
close_notify messages. Non-blocking clients will make a poll/select/etc
call and wait for data from the server. When the close_notify message is
received by the TLS library used by the client software, it will indicate
that data is ready to be read/received. So whether the client is blocking
or non-blocking, it will eventually perform a read/receive call since it
cannot yet know that there is no more data from the server. The
close_notify message from the server will causes the TLS library to return
0 bytes from the read/receive call. Some libraries will also return an
error message or status code indicating that a close_notify was received.
In any case, the connection with the server is automatically closed
(completely in TLS 1.2, and at a minimum from further reads in TLS 1.3).

So, why can't we just use a read/receive of 0 bytes to always know that a
close_notify was received? Because if the TCP connection is closed before a
close_notify, the read/receive call will also return 0 bytes. Some clients
do not have a way to distinguish between TCP disconnect and close_notify.

But should a client author wish to use this feature, those written in C and
using OpenSSL/LibreSSL can use the SSL_read and SSL_get_error functions to
obtain the SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN value. Those written in C and using libtls
can use the tls_read and tls_get_error functions. Python clients can use
the demonstrated method [6]. And while there is no assured way to do this
in Ruby or Go currently, patching Ruby's SSLSocket.sysread or Go's
crypto/tls/conn.go readRecord to use the information already available in
those source files might be possible.

You can inspect the TLS messages received from any server, including
the close_notify message, with the included Python script [6].

130 out of 208 servers listed on GUS [5] send the close_notify
message before disconnecting.
