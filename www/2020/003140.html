I'm not 100% sure if it requires caching or not, but what I would want from a client with a back button is to take me back to where I was in the document's scroll position before I clicked. Some clients are already handling this use case (hooray!). This may be a greater concern for graphical clients than text ones, unless the client is handling paging itself. Losing your place can be frustrating when moving through a series of inter-linked documents. Imagine going through older CAPCOM articles, for instance. Every time you click back needing to scroll back down to wherever you were becomes obnoxious and a reason to just stop. 

Again, I'm not sure if caching is involved in it or not, but that's the best thing I could come up with as an answer to your question.
