</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;because that's how all Internet protocols do it&quot;.
</I>

There are a couple of reasons I like big endian for protocols:

* (although not a strong argument, like in the case of CRLF, and as
you've observed in [2]) most other protocols are big endian, thus
there is a lot of tooling for this;  (for example Erlang even has
built-in functions for this;)

* it is logical;  for example although all integers are stored in
little endian on x86, when we write numbers in code we use &quot;big
endian&quot;;

* (and most importantly) when dumping a protocol capture there are no
&quot;surprises&quot;, I read the number left to right, and if I just take the
bytes in hex and concatenate them I can get the constant, i.e. `[01 02
03 04]` is just `0x01020304`;




&gt;<i> 2) As I feared, this requires a more complicated implementation.  solderpunk
</I>&gt;<i> wanted a protocol that could be implemented quickly and while TLS might be a
</I>&gt;<i> bad protocol, it at least has the feature of being widely available and
</I>&gt;<i> largly transparent if done correctly (like libtls, part of LibreSSL, does).
</I>

The current proof-of-concept in Python I've presented is &quot;feature
complete&quot; in terms of what the current `<A HREF="gemini://`">gemini://`</A> specification
requires;  except perhaps the certificate validation, but the specs
says it should be handled SSH-like.

My take on this is:  if we have a clear specification about what we
require from the transport layer, then we can come-up with a design
and implementation that provides it, nothing more.  At the moment the
`<A HREF="gemini://`">gemini://`</A> specification requires nothing more than what I've
implemented.




&gt;<i> It handles not only the crypo portion, but the framing of data (invisibly to
</I>&gt;<i> the rest of the application).  To tell the truth, I don't know the actual
</I>&gt;<i> bytes of the TLS portion of the protcol as that is handled for me.
</I>

Here I want to argue that you are wrong on the following accounts:

* TLS natively implements a &quot;message stream protocol&quot; (as opposed to
&quot;byte streams&quot;) which it calls TLS records;  (though these
unfortunately are limited to 16 KiB);

* unfortunately libraries (like OpenSSL) doesn't explicitly expose
this to the applications, although it warns the user in the man-page;
however if one calls `SSL_read` with a large enough buffer, at most
one record will be read at one time:

~~~~
<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man3/SSL_read.html">https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man3/SSL_read.html</A>

SSL_read() works based on the SSL/TLS records. The data are received
in records (with a maximum record size of 16kB for SSLv3/TLSv1). Only
when a record has been completely received, it can be processed
(decryption and check of integrity). Therefore data that was not
retrieved at the last call of SSL_read() can still be buffered inside
the SSL layer and will be retrieved on the next call to SSL_read(). If
num is higher than the number of bytes buffered, SSL_read() will
return with the bytes buffered. If no more bytes are in the buffer,
SSL_read() will trigger the processing of the next record. Only when
the record has been received and processed completely, SSL_read() will
return reporting success. At most the contents of the record will be
returned. As the size of an SSL/TLS record may exceed the maximum
packet size of the underlying transport (e.g. TCP), it may be
necessary to read several packets from the transport layer before the
record is complete and SSL_read() can succeed.
~~~~

Thus the TLS framing is not &quot;invisible&quot; to the application, it just
can be safely ignored.

Thus most applications will build yet-another-framing-mechanism on-top
of TLS.  (Just because `<A HREF="gemini://`">gemini://`</A> and other protocols use lines ended
by `CRLF` doesn't mean these aren't &quot;frames&quot;, i.e. one frame is a
sequence of one or multiple bytes followed by exactly one `CRLF` or
perhaps `LF` or perhaps `CR` or perhaps `LFCR`.)


That is why in my protocol proposal we don't need the `CRLF` framing
any more, because we rely on the transport layer to both apply the
framing and do the crypto.




&gt;<i>   In fact, that's part of why HTTPS was so successful---it doesn't change
</I>&gt;<i> the HTTP protocol at all.  It just slips in between TCP and HTTP and is
</I>&gt;<i> transparent to both.
</I>

OK, just because HTTPS was &quot;so successful&quot; doesn't mean we need to
copy it one-to-one.  In case of HTTPS the TLS layer &quot;just slips in
between HTTP and TCP&quot; because it was an afterthought, and everybody
wanted a quick solution, either in terms of TLS offloading / proxy and
other &quot;hacks&quot;.

On the other side a lot of HTTPS security issues stemmed from this
ignorance of TLS, like for example cookie leaks due to TLS
compression, etc.

Thus my position is that a secure protocol can't be designed by
ignoring the actual layer providing the &quot;security&quot;...




&gt;<i>   [ snip ]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hope I haven't made too many mistakes, and I hope this is useful as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a proof-of-concept that one could replace TLS for such simpler
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocols,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I know that given the self-sign certificate nature of Gemini decreases
</I>&gt;<i> security a bit (TOFU and all that), not *all* Gemini servers are using
</I>&gt;<i> self-signed certificates.  There's at least two that I know of that use
</I>&gt;<i> actual signed certificates (from Let's Encrypt), and for my own server, I
</I>&gt;<i> use a signed certificate from my own CA (technically, the certificate isn't
</I>&gt;<i> self-signed, but the CA is self-certificed).  With a signed certificate, you
</I>&gt;<i> get *some* assurance that the server you are talking to is the server you
</I>&gt;<i> expect to be talking to, but it's still, technically, subject to a MITM
</I>&gt;<i> attack (either at the corporate level, or at the state level---it's way less
</I>&gt;<i> likely to come from some random hacker).
</I>

Strictly regarding TLS certificates, my &quot;security&quot; of and &quot;trust&quot; in a
site protected with a proper TLS certificate is proportional to the
amount of effort that is required to:
* break in into the server and steal the private key;
* (in case of non LetsEncrypt certificates) at some point in time in
the last year or two, one is able to social engineer someone at the
company to validate the issuance of a certificate;
* (in case of LetsEncrypt certificates) at some point in time in the
last three months, one was able to hijack or spoof either the DNS,
either the IP behind the domain I'm accessing, and thus validate the
issuance of a certificate;

Thus, personally I don't put a lot of weight in these certificates for
important stuff, instead I put faith in the various &quot;extra checks&quot; the
web and browsers community have implemented, from HTTPS certificate
pinning, to hard-coded certificates in browsers (for Google domains
for example), etc.


So in the end I think the `<A HREF="gemini://`">gemini://`</A> design team should take a decision:
* do we use only self-signed certificates, authenticating them
SSH-like;  (and keep things simple;)
* do we we implement a web-of-trust, like PGP allows;  (as HTTPS has
done with various certificate related verifications outside the X.509
standard;)
* do we rely strictly on TLS certificates;

So if `<A HREF="gemini://`">gemini://`</A> wants to be simple and secure, I would say a mix of
the first two.




&gt;<i>   What's still missing from your proof-of-concept though, is support for
</I>&gt;<i> client certificates.  Yes, you have the &quot;transient&quot; stuff working, but for
</I>&gt;<i> my Gemini server, I have a second that is unavailable unless you have a
</I>&gt;<i> signed certificate from me.  Send in a certificate request, I generate the
</I>&gt;<i> certificate and send that back, and you can access the sooperseecret portion
</I>&gt;<i> of my site [3] (no one has done that yet; then again, I haven't exactly
</I>&gt;<i> advertised that I would do that either).
</I>

On the contrary, the my current protocol does have support for
&quot;permanent&quot; client certificates, as they are just a special case of
&quot;transient&quot; ones;  just:
* create off-line a private / secret key;
* instead of sending a X.509 CSR (which in fact is nothing more than a
self-signed document proving that you have access to the secret key
bound to that public key, and perhaps additional information), send
the public key;
* on the server just whitelist that public key, like we do with
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`;

Sure, now you'll say that with a proper TLS client certificate you
don't need to store it on your server, because you can just verify
that it has a proper signature from your own CA.  However how do you
revoke such a certificate?  You create a CRL which you store in a
file.

Thus in case of TLS you still need to maintain a &quot;blacklist&quot;, while in
my simpler proposal you need to maintain a &quot;whitelist&quot;.  :)




My take on the whole &quot;certificates&quot; would be this:  given that
`<A HREF="gemini://`">gemini://`</A> wants to be simple, let's also keep the crypto stuff
simple;  i.e. no &quot;certificates&quot;, just like in case of SSH public /
private keys.




&gt;<i> [...]  Yes, that complicated *my* end,
</I>&gt;<i> and may complicate a client that wants to support that, but it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> complicate the *protocol* at all---TLS provides all the machinery for that.
</I>

Because `<A HREF="gemini://`">gemini://`</A> mandates the usage of TLS, I think it's unfair to
treat TLS as &quot;not part of the protocol&quot;;  you can ignore that it
exists, but that is counter-productive I think.




&gt;<i>   I'm still going over your code, but I'm not sure I can run it.  For one, I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know which version of Python (I know there are major differences
</I>&gt;<i> between 2 and 3 and I think I only have 2.something---I don't program in
</I>&gt;<i> Python) and I don't have libsodium install (but I do have NaCL).  But again,
</I>&gt;<i> I thank you for doing this work and giving us something tangible to look at
</I>&gt;<i> and run.
</I>
You need Python 2.7 and I would suggest creating a virtualenv.  The
only dependency I used is `pysodium` which requires `libsodium`.  (All
the commands I run are written in the `z-run` file, which I think is
self-explanatory.)
