Yes, this is exactly what I was trying to say. There's no need to join
subsequent lines together. That's just reflowing, as far as I can tell.
But you don't need to reflow in that specific way unless your content
is inconveniently hard-wrapped when you want it to be resizable. This
sort of reflowing leads to loss of information if the single
line-breaks were intended and meaningful, so it makes more sense to me
to not add those line-breaks into the content, but into their rendering
on the client-side.

This is the happiest I've been to see an email in a while honestly lol
