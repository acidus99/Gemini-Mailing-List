<PRE>I normally would not do an announcement on here for a new version (and do not generally plan to
in the future). However, there was a lot of gemini related stuff updated in Bombadillo this time
around and I thought gemini folks using it would want to know about the updates:

Changelog:

* Adds quick navigation to the first 10 links on a page (using the number keys 1 - 0, where 0 represents 10)
* Fixes a bug where on some platforms terminal line wrapping was not properly turned back on when Bombadillo exits
* Adds certificate expiration timestamps to the ini, next to the cert hash
* Uses the newly stored certificate expiration datetimes to autorenew certificates, resulting in far fewer certificate issues for users to deal with manually
* Fixes a bug in which two concurrent bits were trying to both read from stdin, resulting in a read being very buggy
* Adds 'h' and 'l' as hot key aliases for back and forward, bringing things further in line with vi style keybindings and keeping fingers on the home row
* Adds automatic requesting of new certificates on expiration (when the site is next visited)
* Adds support for alt text in gemini preformatted blocks
* Fixes a parsing error when parsing gemini preformatted blocks
* Adds config value 'geminiblocks' to control how alt text displays
* Improved handling of relative URLs for gemini
* Updates the gemini redirect policy to auto-redirect if, and only if, the only change to the requested URL would be the addition of a terminal '/' character
* Fixes issue where querystring values would chain instead of replace
* Removes a dependency on external program 'stty' in favor of a pure Go solution via syscalls
* Updates the man page with the relevant changes

As you may have seen here on the mailing list there is an issue with escaping query strings that is
currently present in all builds. I will be working out a fix after some thinking on the subject, so there
will likely be a patch later in the week.

Thanks to @dancek and @asdf for their contributions to this version and to @makeworld for
helping us sort through the issues and giving good input/guidance

If you build from source (by far the recommended route) you can just pull master and `sudo make install`.

If you use precompiled binaries they are available here:
<A HREF="http://bombadillo.colorfield.space/releases/binaries.html">http://bombadillo.colorfield.space/releases/binaries.html</A>


As an added note: 

If you are a BSD user we are looking for some help making the Makefile function
under BSD (it runs fine for most Linux and OSX systems). At present it does not work under 
FreeBSD 12-Release. 

Additionally, if anyone is interested in getting involved as a maintainer for a package repo
we would be very interested in that (currently the Arch AUR has a git build version, but not
other repos currently have bombadillo).


Thanks everyone! I have been loving the influx of clients, servers, tools, and especially content!!
