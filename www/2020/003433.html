I agree, I'm not saying to dump the whole idea. I just think that if there's
a solution to be found to this, let's find it. If not, well that's too bad,
and we can use this but also encourage people to support Atom where possible.

Maybe a solution to have an *optional* line that reads: &quot;Timezone: EST&quot; or
something similar? Maybe &quot;Timezone: America/Toronto&quot; instead?

That way authors can specify it, but existing pages will work fine and just
be interpreted as UTC.
