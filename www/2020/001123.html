I think this will be important that there are clients out there for 
everyone.

&gt;<i> I am very excited to see that people are starting to explore the
</I>&gt;<i> possibilities for client-driven styling of Geminispace.  Slight
</I>&gt;<i> differences in appearance for different domains, and also for links
</I>&gt;<i> into/out of Geminispace are both excellent ideas.  I'm curious about the
</I>&gt;<i> blue and white geomeric icon shown in your screenshot for the &quot;fabric&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> theme.  Is that randomly generated based on the hostname?  Is it the
</I>&gt;<i> result of a failed favicon request, or is it always there in that theme?
</I>This is a site-specific &quot;placemarker&quot; automatically generated for that 
site. It is the equivalent of a site logo, or something like that. 
Perhaps I might implement putting any favicon there if it exists. Each 
site has a different background &quot;fabric&quot; and placemarker. Together these 
elements help dramatically in my experience in finding your way around. 
You can click a link and recognise you have arrived at a familiar place.

The site placemarker is an active element. It will take you to the the 
home page for the site or user.

My concept of a site is that it is either the domain itself, or if there 
is a user specified in the path, then it is the user home.

<A HREF="gemini://domain1.tld/mypath.gmi">gemini://domain1.tld/mypath.gmi</A> -&gt; site is domain1.tld for that page

<A HREF="gemini://domain2.tld/users/foo/bar/baz.gmi">gemini://domain2.tld/users/foo/bar/baz.gmi</A> -&gt; site is domain/users/foo 
for that page

This gives a nice overall approach that each user gets a singular theme 
applied to all their content, but there can be many users on a domain.

&gt;<i> Something no client has done yet, as far as I know, which I think would
</I>&gt;<i> be great is to make use of the different levels of heading which are
</I>&gt;<i> possible in text/gemini to automatically generate a &quot;table of contents&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> for a long document which could be displayed in a side-panel, and allow
</I>&gt;<i> immediate jumping to a particular location.  A lot of PDF viewers have
</I>&gt;<i> something like this.  This was just as big a motivation for my decision
</I>&gt;<i> to include those headers in the spec as that they look nice.  My hope is
</I>&gt;<i> that with good clients it ends up being extremely easy to make
</I>&gt;<i> geminisites which are very quick and easy to navigate or, at the very
</I>&gt;<i> least, requires a concerted effort to make one which is hard to
</I>&gt;<i> navigate.
</I>Ah yes - it was already on my todo list, and I knew it wasnt going to be 
hard. I'm assuming you mean something like this :-)

I just now uploaded a new 0.8.3 version that has this implemented:

   <A HREF="https://www.marmaladefoo.com/pages/geminaut">https://www.marmaladefoo.com/pages/geminaut</A>

&gt;<i> I would also like to see - and this is just my personal preference,
</I>&gt;<i> which I hope people agree with but which I can't force anybody to share
</I>&gt;<i> - better support in clients for bookmarking and for handling Atom/RSS
</I>&gt;<i> feeds.  The mainstream web experience has tended towards people having
</I>&gt;<i> their browsing directed for them, by things popping up on feeds hosted
</I>&gt;<i> by (a small number of) other people.  There's obviously some value in
</I>&gt;<i> this for content discovery and discussion, but I think it would also be
</I>&gt;<i> nice if, along with the technical changes at a protocol level to
</I>&gt;<i> discourage tracking, reduce software and hardware requirements, and
</I>&gt;<i> generally remove bloat and clutter, Gemini could also be a vehicle for
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;cultural change&quot; toward (among other things!) more self-directed and
</I>&gt;<i> self-paced reading.
</I>
I agree there are a set of cultural practices and expectations that we 
can try to shape with Gemini as a way of using the Internet. Finding the 
sweet spot is always a challenge, but I think there is good evidence of 
the general direction of our collective travel.

&gt;<i> But we'll see how that goes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, this looks like a great project with really interesting plans.
</I>&gt;<i> Please keep us informed!
</I>
Thanks!
