hello all, starlit here with a humble announcement about a Gemini server 
written in ruby. i have no experience with mailing lists so please bear 
with me.

all the code can be found on source hut 
(<A HREF="https://git.sr.ht/~starlit/gemini-ruby-server">https://git.sr.ht/~starlit/gemini-ruby-server</A>). [insert lots of caveats 
here about how it's WIP and how ruby purists will hate it, etc. etc. etc.]

it started as a ruby port of Satellite, but i am trying to take it in 
the direction of a library that you can extend, so you can provide 
custom responses. kind of like a CGI hook, but directly inside of ruby. 
the server does all the validation and handles responses, but gives you 
the request to respond to as you like. (the current version just serves 
files from a directory.)

why did i make this? well,

1. i love ruby for 0 rational reasons (basically still running off of 
the excitement that _why stirred up back in the day), and i have vague 
ideas for what i would do with it (some kind of Weird art project or 
something), and it would be cool to have that in ruby
2. i think it will appeal to cryptids like myself (_ghostly apparitions 
begin snaking into the network_)
3. maybe it will enrich the toolset and breadth of where Gemini and 
related technology can be found
4. &quot;look ma, i'm useful!&quot; it would be cool if i could give something 
back to the amorphous concept of &quot;open software&quot;

i'm really excited and thankful to be doing something &quot;creative&quot; 
especially during these extremely difficult times. i hope this is 
interesting to someone. i'm open to any and all feedback, but please be 
gentle because as the prophet PeePee once said, &quot;i Amn just........... a 
litle creacher. Thatse It . I Canot change this.&quot;
