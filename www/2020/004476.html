<PRE>&gt;<i> Previous contributors to this mailing list highlighted the problem
</I>&gt;<i> that Wikipedia's policies militate against Gemini as it isn't
</I>&gt;<i> trivially discoverable via the sources that Wikipedia privileges.
</I>
&quot;militate&quot; is a strong word... Wikipedia can't let everything in, so
it restricts articles to topics for which there exist sources that
cover it in relative detail, are independent and 'generally reliable'.
&lt;1&gt; To be honest, I'm not sure the two articles would currently
survive a deletion discussion: the sources they cite are stuff like
announcements by gemini-related projects - not independent - and blog
posts - not considered 'generally reliable'.

So really, the existence of a Gemini article is not guaranteed until
it is covered by a publication, preferably multiple publications,
that meet(s) that standard. 'General reliability' mostly has to do
with having a &quot;reputation for fact-checking and accuracy&quot;.&lt;2&gt;

Obviously, we think Wikipedia should have an article on Gemini, but
equally obviously, we are biased. Unfortunately for us, the Wikipedia
bureaucracy can be quite unforgiving :).

&gt;<i> We'll see if this persists as an issue; the mitigation would be to
</I>&gt;<i> do some marketing, but that's probably not something we want just
</I>&gt;<i> yet.
</I>
My instinctive response is to end that sentence with &quot;ever&quot; instead. I
associate the term marketing with empty publicity for commercial
products. Gemini will naturally become gradually more relevant as
people keep putting effort into it, and consequently more well-known.
