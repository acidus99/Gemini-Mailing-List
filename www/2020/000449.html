&gt;<i>   Why is a numeric status code so bad?  Yes, the rest of the protocol is

Why did people use `/etc/hosts` files before DNS was invented?  Why do
we have `/etc/services`?  Why do we have `O_READ`?  Why do we have
`chmod +x`?

Because numbers are hard to remember, and say nothing to a person that
doesn't know the spec by heart.  (For example although I do a lot of
HTTP related work with regard to routing and such, I always don't
remember which of the 4-5 HTTP redirect codes says &quot;temporary redirect
but keep the same method&quot; as &quot;opposed to temporary redirect but switch
to `GET`&quot;.)




&gt;<i> &gt; As minor issues:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * why `CRLF`?  it's easier (both in terms of availability of functions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and efficiency) to split lines by a single character `\n` than by a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; string;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   That was discussed earlier on the list:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         <A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2019/000116.html">https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2019/000116.html</A>
</I>

OK, reading that email the answer seems to be &quot;because other protocols
have it&quot;...  And even you admit that in your own code you also handle
just `LF`.

So then why bother?  Why not simplify the protocol?




&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; On a second thought, why TLS?  Why not something based on NaCL /
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; `libsodium` constructs, or even the &quot;Noise Protocol&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; (<A HREF="http://www.noiseprotocol.org/">http://www.noiseprotocol.org/</A>)?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;         1) Never, *NEVER* implement crypto yourself.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was never proposing to implement crypto ourselves.  `libsodium` /
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; NaCL provides very useful high-level constructs, tailored for specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use-cases (like for example message encryption and signing), that are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proven to be safe, and exports them with a very simple API that can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easily understood and used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   TLS was choosen because the COMMUNICATIONS LINK is encrypted, not just the
</I>&gt;<i> payload.  All Eve (the evesdropper) can see is what IP address you are
</I>&gt;<i> connecting to, not what content you are reading, nor (depending upon the TLS
</I>&gt;<i> version) what virtual server you might be talking to.
</I>

Although I do agree that encryption at the &quot;transport&quot; level to hide
the entire traffic is a good idea, if you take into account that
`<A HREF="gemini://`">gemini://`</A> requires one request and one reply per TCP connection
(thus TLS connection), there is no actual &quot;communications link here&quot;.

Basically you are using TLS to encrypt only one payload.  Moreover
also because there is exactly one request / one reply one can just
look at the traffic pattern and deduce what the user is doing just by
analyzing the length of the stream (in both ways) and the time the
server takes to respond (which says static or dynamically generated).
(Granted TLS records are padded, however even so, having the size as
multiple of some fixed value, still gives an insight into what was
requested.)

For example say lives in a country where certain books (perhaps about
cryptography) are forbidden;  now imagine there is a library out there
that serves these books through `<A HREF="gemini://`;">gemini://`;</A>  now imagine the country
wants to see what books are read by its own citizens;  all it has to
do is record each session and deduce a response size range, then crawl
that library and see which books fit into that range.

Therefore I would say (I'm no cryptographer) TLS doesn't help at all,
einter does PGP, either `libsodium` / NaCL...




Another related topic regarding TLS that just struck me:  given that
`<A HREF="gemini://`">gemini://`</A> supports out-of-the-box virtual hosts, do you couple that
with TLS SNI?

If not basically TLS is just an &quot;obfuscation&quot; than actual end-to-end
encryption.  Why I say that:  because the spec says one should use
SSH-style &quot;do you trust this server&quot; questions and keep that
certificate in mind.  But how about when the certificate expires, or
is revoked?  (SSH server public keys never expire...)  How does the
user know that the certificate was rightfully replaced or he is a
victim of an MITM attack?




&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Why not just re-use PGP to sign / encrypt requests and replies?  With
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; regard to PGP,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   There are issues with using PGP:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;         <A HREF="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are issues with any technology, TLS included.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However I would say it's easier to integrate GnuPG (even through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; subprocesses) in order to encrypt / decrypt payloads (especially given
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how low in count they are for Gemini's ecosystem) than implementing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TLS.  Moreover it offers out-of-the-box the whole client side
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certificate management, which adding to a TLS-based client would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much more involved, more on this bellow...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   As I have mentioned, that only protects the payload, not the
</I>&gt;<i> communications channel.
</I>

But as said, you don't have an actual communications channel because
you use TLS for a single request / reply payload pair...  :)




&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   The hardest problem with crypto is key management.  If anything, key
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; management with PGP seems more problematic than with OpenSSL and the CA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; infrastructure (as bad as the CA infrastructure is).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One of the `<A HREF="gemini://`">gemini://`</A> specifications explicitly states that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server certificate authentication model is similar to SSH's first use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accept and cache afterward.  However say you'll go with the actual CA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; model, now you need to juggle Let's Encrypt (each 3 months) (or add
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support for ACME in your server), then juggle PEM files, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regardless, either way one will have to implement all this certificate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; management from scratch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Or self-signed certificates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Okay, we use NaCL.  Now what?  What's needed to secure the communication
</I>&gt;<i> channel?  A key exchange.  Again, rule 1---never implement crypto.
</I>

Given that one has the public key of the server (more on that later),
one could use the following on client / server sides:

    <A HREF="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/sealed_boxes">https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/sealed_boxes</A>

```
The crypto_box_seal() function encrypts a message m of length mlen for
a recipient whose public key is pk. It puts the ciphertext whose
length is crypto_box_SEALBYTES + mlen into c.

The function creates a new key pair for each message, and attaches the
public key to the ciphertext. The secret key is overwritten and is not
accessible after this function returns.

The crypto_box_seal_open() function decrypts the ciphertext c whose
length is clen, using the key pair (pk, sk), and puts the decrypted
message into m (clen - crypto_box_SEALBYTES bytes).
```

How does one get the public key of the server?  One could change the
protocol so that the server speaks first and sends its own public key.


My take on this:  given a set of clear requirements for the
`<A HREF="gemini://`">gemini://`</A> protocol (which I've seen there are) one can come up with
better solutions than TLS, ones that better fit the use-case.

(Again, just to be clear, I'm not saying &quot;lets invent our own crypto&quot;,
but instead &quot;let's look at other tested&quot; alternatives.  As a
side-note, NaCL, on which `libsodium` is based, was created by `Daniel
J. Bernstein`...)




&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding an up-to-date Gopher map alternative, I think this is an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; important piece of the Gopher ecosystem that is missing from today's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; world:  a machine-parsable standard format of indexing documents.  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; very fondly remember &quot;directory&quot; sites of yesteryear (like DMOZ or the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; countless other clones) that strives to categorize the internet not by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;machine learning&quot; but by human curation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   Could you provide an example of what you mean by this?  I'm not sure why a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; map alternative is needed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One problem with today's web is that the actual &quot;web structure&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; embedded in unstructured documents as links.  What I liked about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Gopher maps is that it gave a machine-readable, but still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user-friendly, way to map and categorize the &quot;web contents&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   One problem with that---incentives.  What's my incentive to make all this
</I>&gt;<i> information more easily machine readable?  On the web, you do that, and what
</I>&gt;<i> happens?  Google comes along, munches on all that sweet machine readable
</I>&gt;<i> data and serves it up directly to users, meaning the user just has to go to
</I>&gt;<i> Google for the information, not your server.  Given those incentives, I have
</I>&gt;<i> no reason to make my data easily machine readable when it means less
</I>&gt;<i> traffic.
</I>

The incentive is a clear one:  for the end-user.  Given that we can
standardize on such an &quot;index&quot;, then we can create better
&quot;user-agents&quot; that are more useful to our actual users.  (And I'm not
even touching on the persons that have various disabilities that
hamper their interaction with computers.)

For example say I'm exposing a API documentation via `<A HREF="gemini://`.">gemini://`.</A>  How
do I handle the &quot;all functions index page&quot;?  Do I create a large
`text/gemini` file, or a large HTML file?  How does the user interact
with that?  With search?  Wouldn't he be better served by a searchable
interface which filters the options as he types, like `dmenu` / `rofi`
/ `fzf` (or the countless other clones) do?  (Currently each
programming language from Rust to Scheme tries to do something similar
with JavaScript and the result is horrible...)

Or, to take another approach, why do people use Google to search
things?  Because our web pages are so poor when it comes to
structuring information, that most often than not, when I want to find
something on a site I just Google: `site:example.com the topic i'm
interested in`.




&gt;<i>   I recall the large push for RDF (Resource Description Framework) back
</I>&gt;<i> around 2004 or so ... embed machine parsable relations and metadata and it
</I>&gt;<i> would be oh so wonderful.  Some people even bothered to to all that work.
</I>&gt;<i> And for what?  It was a pain to maintain, the tooling was poor, and Google
</I>&gt;<i> would just suck it up and serve it to users directly, no reason for anyone
</I>&gt;<i> to actually visit your site.
</I>
I'm not advocating for RDF (it was quite convoluted) or semantic web,
or GraphQL, etc.  I'm just advocating something better than the Gopher
map.




&gt;<i>   As a user, that's great!  As a web site operator, not so much.
</I>

OK...  Now here is something I don't understand:  aren't you building
Gemini sites for &quot;users&quot;?  You are building it for &quot;operators&quot;?

Because if the operator is what you optimize for, then why not just
SSH into the operator's server where he provides you with his
&quot;favourite&quot; BBS clone.




&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; * and perhaps add support for content-based addressing (as opposed to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; server-based addressing) (i.e. persistent URL's);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   There already exist such protocols---I'm not sure what a new one based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; around Gemini would buy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree that `<A HREF="gemini://`">gemini://`</A> is first and foremost a &quot;transfer&quot; protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However one can include a document's identity as a first class citizen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example say each document is identified by its SHA;  then when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; replying with a document also send that SHA in form of a permanent URL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like say `gemini-object:?sha={SHA}&amp;location=<A HREF="gemini://first-server/...&amp;location=gemini://second-server/...`;">gemini://first-server/...&amp;location=gemini://second-server/...`;</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  then a client (that perhaps has bookmarked that particular version of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that document) could send that URL to a server (of his choosing via
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; configuration, to the first one specified in `location`, etc.) and if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that server has that document just reply with that, else use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; `location`, else return 404.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Hey, go ahead and implement that.  I'd like to see that ...
</I>

There is already FreeNet and IPFS that implement content-based
addressing.  I just wanted something in between that is still
&quot;location&quot; driven, but is &quot;content identity&quot; aware.

Ciprian.
