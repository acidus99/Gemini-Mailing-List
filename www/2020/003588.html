<PRE>Hi

&gt;<i> I don't see it as Gemini's role to attempt to set a cultural/legal privacy
</I>&gt;<i> framework for servers who are choosing to publish on Gemini. We cannot
</I>&gt;<i> imagine we can break new ground in this respect.
</I>
That seems ... rather defeatist. 

Alasdair Gray provides an inspirational quote for a situation like this:

  &quot;Work as if you live in the early days of a better nation&quot;

(apparently later he wanted to say world, but nation had stuck...)

Gemini is still a young project, where a different culture
and nicer norms could be established...

Long ago, before the web, when the internet was young
somebody grabbed the jokes from rec.humor.funny (I think, might
have been another newsgroup) and published them in book form. Some
posters were outraged at the copyright violation, others
flattered. 

Had the individual posters just had a way of telling us
how their material could have been re-used, there would
have been no controversy, and maybe this would have
laid the groundwork for a different way of aggregating
online material, with internet editors neatly assembling
&quot;best-ofs&quot; or &quot;my conversations-with-...&quot; and people
optimising their comments for quotability or adding
footnotes and expansions to posts they were keen to
improve... instead of just feeble likes.

TLDR: I can imagine it. 

regards

marc
