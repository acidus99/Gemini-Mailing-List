<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; The most difficult part of what you outlined is the Unicode normalization,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which maybe not all languages have libraries for, and would also require
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; updating every so often. But it wouldn't be a requirement for clients at all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just something nice to have.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If a client has an unnormalized IRI, it needs to normalize it before sending
</I>&gt;<i> it to the server.
</I>
Could you justify this? It's a good thing to have, but it feels like a big ask,
as Unicode support and especially things like normalization are not straightforward
in all languages. I don't see why it can't just be recommended and not required.

&gt;<i> &gt; I assume you mean NFC normalization?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.&#160; When I speak of normalization, I mean NFC normalization exclusively.
</I>
Sounds good!

&gt;<i> &gt; What if the user named a domain/file/folder in a non-NFC way? Now does the server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to support NFC as well, and apply it to vhost recognition or local file paths
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to correctly match requests? That seems wrong. But so does the user entering
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something visually identical to what the sysadmin typed, and things not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; working.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm okay with that just failing, as file names are not really part of text/gemini
</I>&gt;<i> content.&#160; The difference will be obvious to the admin by checking the requested
</I>&gt;<i> URIs from the server log against the %-encoded names of the folders.
</I>
The issue is that admins are not the only ones who create folders and files.
Non-technical people will as well, and a bug like this will be very confusing.
Everything will look right, but it just won't work. However, I doubt this will
occur very often, and it's an acceptable tradeoff to supporting Unicode.
