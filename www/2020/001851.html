<PRE>&gt;<i> * is the concept still &quot;alive&quot;?  is the document still &quot;open for
</I>comments&quot;?

I have been in discussions with solderpunk about this and there has
been debate whether to move forward. I have a server built and have
integrated mercury support into a branch of my client. However,
that support differs from the original posting of mercury as a concept
(it simplifies status codes, but there have been talks about removing
the status codes altogether). I was definitely using a different port than
the suggested 1963 (I think I used 1961, the year of the first crewed
flight). My implementation uses text/gemini but only recognizes link
lines and all other lines are treated as plain text rendered literally.

In any case I would consider waiting to implement until solderpunk is
back on the mailing list as I know he had thoughts about this (I believe
he was hoping to deliver a finished and complete spec and not really
hash out the concept much beyond that). Otherwise I think we run the
risk of fragmented implementation and drawn out discussions to patch
up that fragmentation whenr eally this should be a simple thing that all
can just build from an already established spec.
