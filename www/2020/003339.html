To clarify, I was referring to being reserved for the use in a
standardized protocol specific function.

&gt;<i> The word &quot;reserved&quot; in the spec only ever refers to characters that

</I>
The word &quot;reserved&quot; refers to characters that must be escaped in RFC
3986, not in the Gemini spec, I was specifically referring to the case
where the query portion of the URI in 1X requests is reserved
specifically for user input therefore it can't be used for other
purpose in that specific case.

I was pointing out the fact that the Gemini spec referred to the query
portion of URI as &quot;allowed and have no special meanings beyond those
defined by the generic syntax&quot;, this is confusing because A) the query
portion does have meaning in the context of user input responses, and in
that case it is actually reserved and can not be used for other purpose
B) &quot;the generic syntax&quot; is vague term.

What were you referring to by &quot;the spec&quot;, did you mean RFC 3986 or the
Gemini spec?
