Please do!  It would be great to have AV-98 work on as many platforms as
possible.  I think this should be very possible, I've probably just been
lazy about path manipulations somewhere or something like that.

Hmm, well, it will, by default, try calling out to programs like `cat`
and `less` which it may not find (although I understand there's a lot
more support for unix-like userspace in modern Windows?).  That should
all be fixable with some calls to `handler` (which you can then stick in
an rc file to make persistent).  Let me know if you have problems with
any of this.

Cheers,
