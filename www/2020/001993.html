<PRE>Dear list,

I would like to play around with Gemini and build a personal site. I'd
love to be able to host it on my main domain at <A HREF="gemini://evertpot.com/">gemini://evertpot.com/</A>

However, that domain is currently pointing to Github Pages, something I
would like to not change.

It occurred to me that it would be nice if I could use DNS SRV records
to point <A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> clients to a different host. However, after reading
the spec it doesn't seem like there is support for this.

I would love support for this, but or that to be realistically useful,
it would have to be in the spec and required. I know a lot of HTTP folks
wish they had that from the start too, as it's a pain to adopt later.

I couldn't find in the archives if this has been asked before.

Great project, and I hope I can make a positive contribution to the
ecosystem.

Evert
