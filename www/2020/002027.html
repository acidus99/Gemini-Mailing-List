It's funny that we've reached the point where rocketry-related names for gemini projects
are beginning to collide. That would seem to say something about both the number of
projects in gemini and the lack of rocketry-related names. I myself used the name
titan coincidentally also for the name of a java gemini client in like March as the final
project for a CS course, although I named it that not only for the rocket but also to
bully Java for being big and bad and eating its children and deserving of getting
banished to Tartarus (using Java was required in the final project so I was semi-salty).

My actual question (to the list, not just you) is this: has any known site implemented
Titan support besides CommunityWiki, and has any client implemented titan support
besides Alex Schroeder's titan bash function? Last thing I knew, Titan was being
discussed on this list but no one had formalized anything about it yet, and even the name
was just someone's thrown-in idea that solderpunk said was better than gemini+submit and
you had said you'd keep in mind. After that if my memory can be trusted the thread flowed
into streaming discussion. Is there somewhere else (an IRC channel, another mailing list,
etc) where Titan development has been discussed?

Thanks,
</PRE>
