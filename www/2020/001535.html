</I>&gt;<i> Very true. They are all equivalent:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="gemini://cookie@mozz.us/beer/">gemini://cookie@mozz.us/beer/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="gemini://mozz.us/beer/?cookie">gemini://mozz.us/beer/?cookie</A>

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="gemini://mozz.us/beer/cookie">gemini://mozz.us/beer/cookie</A>
</I>
But the userinfo case seems to be clearly the worst.  If a server uses a
redeirect to attach a &quot;cookie&quot; token to the client's URL using a query
or a fragment, that won't get carried across when relative links are
absolutised, so the scope is limited to that one document, unless the
client somehow plays along by recognising the cookie and propagating it
itself (which no sane client will do).  The path option *will* survive
absolutisation, (well, if you  <A HREF="gemini://mozz.us/beer/cookie/,">gemini://mozz.us/beer/cookie/,</A> with a 
trailing slash) but to give every visitor a unique cookie and track them
across the site this way (and, yes, I've always known this is
unavoidable, it's mentioned in some of the very earliest Gemini
writings, from before the project even had a name) requires all content
at the site to be dynamically generated.  Which is possible, of course,
but it's a barrier of sorts, at least. 

The userinfo approach both survives absolutisation *and* works with a
perfectly static text/gemini file using relative links.  It's an
extremely easy and lightweight way to unambiguously track users within
one server, and unlike guessing based off IP (which is also of course
unavoidable) it is robust against multiple users sharing an IP at once.
Of the four approaches outlined above, userinfo clearly has a much
higher &quot;damage inflicted to effort required&quot; ratio than the others.

I don't yet have a clear idea of to what extent URI schemes are
permitted to &quot;pick and choose&quot; from the components of the generic URI
scheme as presented in RFC3986.  It is clear that the &quot;authority&quot;
component (what normal people think of as the hostname and port) is not
required, but if a scheme does require an authority does it also *need*
to permit the userinfo?  The gopher URI scheme (RFC4266) a defintion
clearly does not allow one, but URIs for gopher are a tacked on
after-thought and I don't know how carefully that scheme was designed.
But if it's legitimate for me to declare that the <A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> URI scheme
does not support userinfo, I'll do it in a flash.  This cookie redirect
thought experiment proves that it's far too dangerous, it's just barely
better than an actual HTTP cookie (in that it's not easily sent to third
parties).

Of course, just saying it's unsupported isn't enough, because servers
can try to do it anyway, so every client now needs to explicitly check
for this and either error out or remove the userinfo.

&quot;URIs were a mistake&quot;, as the kids say.  Gopher's menu item format might
be a total PITA for users, but you know exactly what the valid scope of
each component is and there are no &quot;side channels&quot;.

&gt;<i> &gt; At the end of the day all you can do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is call out dodgy behaviour, and if site owners tried it anyway,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attempt to make this sort of thing visible to client users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure. 
</I>
Ultimately, yes, but one can try to reduce the number of places
dodginess is possible to be as few as possible to reduce the burden of
playing this whack-a-mole game.

&gt;<i> Same as 6x (CLIENT CERTIFICATE REQUIRED), but less ceremonial.
</I>
And also less consensual.  The ceremony is there for a reason.  Gemini
is supposed to be as close to anonymous by default as the limitations of
running it over TCP/IP allow.  Turning that off, to partake of an
application which maintains state, is *supposed* to be a song and dance.
It should be impossible to not realise you're doing it.  I don't even
mind if doing it is slightly inconvenient, because it should always be a
conscious and considered choice.  It should also be extremely easy to
write a client which is obviously totally incapable of doing it.

Yes, this rules out the notion of &quot;lightweight content-negotiation&quot;.  So
what?  Has anybody ever once missed that concept in Gopherspace, or in
nascent Geminispace?  How much value does that idea have for a network
where the majority of content is very minimally formatted plaintext?
Could it ever possibly be worth the risk of introducing something which
can be twisted to act as a cookie?

Sometimes taking a strong stand against very clearly very bad things
(pervasive and uncontrollable tracking) means choosing to live without
some nice things that seem harmless on the surface.  It's a shame, but
that's the way it is.  Thankfully it turns out most nice things are
actually pretty easy to do without once you get rid of it.

&gt;<i> I.e. automated cookie tagging is the equivalent of server driven 61 TRANSIENT CERTIFICATE REQUESTED.
</I>
Characterising 6x status codes as &quot;server driven&quot; is extremely
misleading.  The server can only issue *requests* for a certificate.
There is no mechanism for the server to just ram one down the client's
throat.  The client has to opt in, and they can at any point opt-out.
If I delete the private key matching a certificate, that's the end of
that identity.  I'd call that &quot;client driven&quot;.  If I delete one of your
userinfo cookies, the server can recognise my IP and feed me the same
value again, resurrecting it.  Yes, there's a risk they'll get it wrong
if that IP is a pubnix or VPN address, but probabilistic persistent
tracking is better than no tracking at all, so they'll try it, and will
be right some of the time.

&gt;<i> Minus the yak shaving.
</I>
I guess some yaks are our friends.
