The specification is still a very rough draft.

&gt;<i> Second, TLS libraries come with the cryptographic primitives required,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> yes, there is negotiation that happens, but that's because as
</I>&gt;<i> cryptographic
</I>&gt;<i> primitives are broken, new ones can be slotted in and used. Here, if
</I>&gt;<i> (and

</I>&gt;<i> primitive is removed.
</I>
If Ed25519 is broken, then it would be considered insecure, and a new
KeyShare message could be added in a backwards-compatible way.

&gt;<i> Even so, anyone attempting to implement Ed25519 is a fool for the
</I>&gt;<i> pitfalls
</I>&gt;<i> are subtle and *will* be exploited; I'm guessing you are assuming the
</I>&gt;<i> use of
</I>&gt;<i> libsodium (or God help you, libnacl) with this protocol, right?
</I>
Yes, I assume that you would not implement the cryptography yourself.

&gt;<i> I'm no crytographic expert, but I don't see how this protocol prevents
</I>&gt;<i> MITM attacks; the details in the key share (section 2.2.1) don't go into
</I>&gt;<i> enough detail for my liking. How do I know I'm talking to the server in
</I>&gt;<i> question, and not being invisibly proxied by Eve or Mal?
</I>
MITM protection is covered in section 2.2.4. Essentially, the server
signs the key share messages with its certificate private key, and the
client verifies this signature.

&gt;<i> And how does each
</I>&gt;<i> side determine an insecure key share? What exactly goes over the wire?
</I>
A key share would be insecure if it is later &quot;broken&quot; as you said.

I don't expect anyone to use this instead of TLS, it is mostly just for
educational purposes and to gather ideas of what a simpler TLS could
look like.
