</I>
Good!  The way stuff is done in AV-98 current is *not* supposed to be
normative.  It's supposed to give us the ability to experiment with
different client certificate work flows so we can see what works and
does not.
 
&gt;<i> ## User interface
</I>&gt;<i> * The technical terminology &quot;client certificate&quot;, which describes an
</I>&gt;<i> implementation detail rather than the underlying concept, is mostly hidden
</I>&gt;<i> from the user. Instead, the client talks about &quot;identities&quot;. An identity is
</I>&gt;<i> just a client certificate along with an optional name.
</I>&gt;<i> * In diohsc, there are two kinds of identity -- temporary anonymous
</I>&gt;<i> identities and long-term named identities. The latter are saved to disc, the
</I>&gt;<i> former are held only in memory.
</I>&gt;<i> * There is no way to name and save an anonymous identity. Allowing it would
</I>&gt;<i> complicate the UI and the conceptual distinction between the two kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> identity.
</I>
This all sounds pretty sensible.

&gt;<i> ### Creating identities
</I>&gt;<i> * When 61 is received, the user is asked if they want to create an anonymous
</I>&gt;<i> identity.
</I>&gt;<i> * On any other 6* error code, the user may select an existing named identity
</I>&gt;<i> or create a new named or anonymous identity, and then retry the request.
</I>&gt;<i> * When creating a named identity, the user is prompted to set a Common Name
</I>&gt;<i> (which can be empty). This is the only choice required of the user. It would
</I>&gt;<i> make for a neater UI to automatically set the Common Name to be the name of
</I>&gt;<i> the identity, and in some ways it would make sense. But the user may well
</I>&gt;<i> want to use the same Common Name (e.g. &quot;anon&quot; or &quot;&quot;) on multiple servers
</I>&gt;<i> without a common identity.
</I>
For what it's worth, I am thinking pretty heavily about deprecating the
current status code 61 (and 21).  They totally violate the idea that all
status codes should degrade gracefully in super simple clients which
ignore the second digit.  If 61 is interpreted as 60, there is no
guarantee that the resulting certificate will be transient as intended,
and if 21 is interpreted as 20 the active certificate may not be deleted
as soon as the server is done with it.

I am increasingly thinking that having a single code for on-demand
certificates and encouraging clients to implement the
transient/persistent distinction themselves, like you are doing with any
other 6* code.

&gt;<i> ### Using identities
</I>&gt;<i> * An identity can be set to be used on a given server at and below a given
</I>&gt;<i> URI path. So you can have one identity in use for
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="gemini://foo.bar/~quux/...,">gemini://foo.bar/~quux/...,</A> and another for <A HREF="gemini://foo.bar/~xuuq/...">gemini://foo.bar/~xuuq/...</A>
</I>&gt;<i> * Whenever an URI is shown to the user, it is annotated with the identity,
</I>&gt;<i> if any, which would be used if it were requested; e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;<A HREF="gemini://foo.bar/~xuuq/hello.gmi[clarkKent">gemini://foo.bar/~xuuq/hello.gmi[clarkKent</A>]&quot;. This includes relative URIs
</I>&gt;<i> in links. So the user knows when they're going to use what identity.
</I>&gt;<i> * Colouring is used to visually separate the annotation from the URI (but
</I>&gt;<i> '[' and ']' are reserved characters in URIs, so this isn't actually
</I>&gt;<i> necessary).
</I>&gt;<i> * Anonymous identities are denoted as &quot;[]&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> * If the user requests an URI which would use an identity which hasn't been
</I>&gt;<i> used in 30m, they are asked to confirm whether they want to still use it. If
</I>&gt;<i> they don't want to, the identity is disabled for this path.
</I>
This also all sounds really good!  How does a certificate come to be
restricted to a given URL path and subpaths?  Is it just up to the user
to take an educated guess at the required scope for a cert and manually
specify the path?  I have been thinking that perhaps the &lt;META&gt; line for
status coedes 6x could be used for the server to specify precisely this
information.

&gt;<i> ### Controlling identities
</I>&gt;<i> * There is a single new command added to deal with identities: &quot;identify
</I>&gt;<i> [URI]&quot;. If URI is missing, it defaults to the current URI (if any).
</I>&gt;<i> * If there is an identity in use at the URI, after confirmation it is
</I>&gt;<i> removed.
</I>&gt;<i> * Otherwise the user is prompted to select an existing identity or create a
</I>&gt;<i> new one, as if 60 had been received.
</I>
Aah, so this is how certs get associated with a path.

&gt;<i> ## Certificates
</I>&gt;<i> * To minimise information leakage to the server, all certificates, for both
</I>&gt;<i> anonymous and named identities, are created the same way apart from the
</I>&gt;<i> Common Name.
</I>&gt;<i> * The expiration date is set to 2 years in the future. I'm not sure if this
</I>&gt;<i> is the best compromise.
</I>&gt;<i> * The &quot;valid from&quot; date is set to 1 year in the past. Why not set it to the
</I>&gt;<i> current time? It's a known problem that users &quot;in the wild&quot; often don't have
</I>&gt;<i> correctly set clocks -- they don't set the right time zone, then set the
</I>&gt;<i> clock to make the time &quot;look right&quot;. Since gemini servers are meant to be
</I>&gt;<i> widely deployed, we shouldn't expect either client or server to have the
</I>&gt;<i> right time. So we should backdate certificates by at least a couple of days,
</I>&gt;<i> and then a year seems a nice round safe choice.
</I>&gt;<i> * The serial number is set to 0, no extensions are set, and the
</I>&gt;<i> distinguished name consists only of the Common Name.
</I>&gt;<i> * The key is 2048 bit RSA with public exponent e=65537, and with hash
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm SHA256. I would have liked to use Ed25519, which is more efficient
</I>&gt;<i> in size and processing, but not all servers accept it.
</I>
I have also been wondering about putting something in the best practices
about certificate key types and sizes (based on discussions with 80h
about performance on their ESP8266 implementation).  And about
ciphersuites generally, with a view toward minimising TLS overhead and
improving performance on low-power machines like Raspbery Pis.

&gt;<i> ### Fingerprinting
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, these choices identify diohsc uniquely. Hopefully a future
</I>&gt;<i> version of the spec will suggest defaults to prevent such fingerprinting,
</I>&gt;<i> and I think these would be reasonable choices. But it could be worth
</I>&gt;<i> considering mandating Ed25519, even if this means only TLS1.3 servers can
</I>&gt;<i> use client certificates. This can be considered an &quot;advanced&quot; feature for a
</I>&gt;<i> server, so it isn't so much of a problem if some servers aren't capable of
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
This is definitely worth giving consideration and the spec *should*
eventually say stuff about this.

Cheers,
