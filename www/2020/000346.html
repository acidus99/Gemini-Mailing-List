I don't think it's too high. I just wrote up an awful implementation in 
the most naive way possible and it came out ~30 lines, with a good deal of
that being the edge case of words longer than the viewport width (i 
handled this by splitting these words with hyphens at the viewport width;
i don't know if there are other edge-cases that need to be handled but i 
can't think of any).

I'm attaching it. You can execute it with:

```
python3 wrap.py [length] [text]
```

Or import it and call wrap with first parameter being the text and the
second being the viewport width.

I can't stress enough how &quot;not perfect&quot; this is (I wrote it up on my
phone, of all things, in about 5 minutes, so very little thought was put
into making it good) but at the very least it's doable. I know you mention
that python can do this natively, but I didn't use any dynamic-typing, and
all that's required for this sort of implementation is a method to split 
by newline and space, so really something like this could be done pretty 
universally.

But it's still not good.
