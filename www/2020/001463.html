<PRE>My two cents: I don&#8217;t understand why server gets to decide if user&#8217;s
certificate is transient or not. I as a user should make that decision. If
they want to lose access to their Astro plant, that&#8217;s their decision. In my
opinion there should just be one 6X status code, to request that user
retries with a certificate. If user didn&#8217;t use one, meta field should
explain why it is needed. If user used one - meta should explain why it was
declined (expiry, invalid, etc)

Using this logic, I would say status code 21 is similarly unnecessary. User
should be able to decide if they want to stop using client certificate.
AV-98 for instance allows user to do that (so does my iOS client). It seems
to me that status 21 tries to implement a logout functionality from the
web, where users have a jarfull of cookies and might not be able to delete
the right one. In Gemini on the other hand, it can be a simple toggle
switch.
