I set up the whitelist to combat a large number of automated accounts 
being created. It was several dozen automated spam accounts per week, 
which was a pain to deal with!

I've added @sdf.org to the whitelist and I'm happy to create accounts 
for people as needed as I mentioned above.

&gt;<i> I get that tildegit is intended to serve the tildeverse so in some ways
</I>&gt;<i> this restriction makes perfect sense.  It's kind of a shame, though, for
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;outsiders&quot; to not be able to open issues, make pull requests, etc. :(
