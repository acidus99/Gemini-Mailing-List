<PRE>Hi, Gemini peoples!

I have two main proposals for getting information like content-size
(which, as has been discussed previously, would be very useful for even
slightly big responses).

1. Define specific additional MIME type parameters.  For example, one
   could return '20 application/gzip; content-size=42069420' as the
   response line.  This could also be used for giving the client a hash
   of the data (parameter name e.g. 'content-hash-sha256'), useful for
   verification and for checking against local caches of the same page.

   To just check the MIME type (now possibly with size and hash), as
   jmcbray had mentioned on a previous thread on the topic, the best
   solution is to just request the page and terminate the connection
   after the request line.  Perhaps it should be specified in the spec
   that clients may do this, and servers may want to be prepared for
   this outcome.

   A possible issue is that the hash will not fit within the META line,
   given the 1024 byte limitation (this is especially problematic for
   things like SHA 512 hashes).  We could work around this either by
   increasing the mandated maximum META line size (probably not
   possible), or by providing this information using the second proposal
   but still using this proposal (or both) for content-size.

   A potential drawback is that we open ourselves up to further
   extension this way, but I would argue that this avenue has always
   been around.  If the spec defined only these two fields, and mandated
   that aside from them only parameters defined by the MIME spec may be
   included, then it _should_ be fine.

2. Define an additional endpoint for retrieving meta info.

   On ~chat, bjorn.warmedal layed out the possibility of using the
   '/.content' URL to return a content hash.  This would function like a
   normal URL, one which accepts as input the URL of the page to
   retrieve content information about.

   I propose that the response from a '/.content?/&lt;path&gt;' request
   returns the MIME type of the URL '/&lt;path&gt;', optionally including
   content-size and content-hash-* parameters (this works because there
   are no size restrictions for the content, unlike the META line).  Its
   MIME type can be bikeshed if this proposal is agreed upon.  The
   response format may be exactly an MIME type (i.e. no CR LF or
   anything).

   Unfortunately, extension becomes possible simply by using a different
   MIME type.  I don't know how to prevent this.

I think that proposal #1 is definitely doable, but I understand that #2
can be more problematic for some.  I suppose #2 would be beneficial if
we determine that content-hash is really necessary, but further
extensibility is unwanted and should be prevented somehow.
