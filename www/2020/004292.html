It is at the clients discretion by my reading; it's not brought up at
all in the spec. In general it's probably best for the client to avoid
caching, at least by default. According to Stephane's statistics page&#185;,
most documents are typically rather small anyway (but perhaps some of
the larger ones are more popular...)

The main cost is establishing a connection and the TLS handshake,
where the client and server have to do some back-and-forths and will
spend a lot of time just waiting for responses. For this reason I
personally prefer to use caching liberally, at least for the duration
of my session. There are some applications that will break as a result,
but I don't tend to use them myself.

I think that no-caching-by-default should be suggested as a best
practice in the best practices document.
