<PRE>Hi - me again

&gt;<i> &gt; A final line in any .gmi file of the form
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   &quot;-- CC-BY-SA: Your Name&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would have the added benefit that it would survive being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; copied around, and stay in place even if the original site
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disappears.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.  But it's advisable to have an actual copyright notice using either
</I>&gt;<i> ?? or the English word &quot;Copyright&quot; and the current year.  If you make it a
</I>&gt;<i> link line, you can also link to the exact license you are using.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that there is no reason to update the copyright date when you make a
</I>&gt;<i> change, much less to make a change *just* to update the date.  Doing so
</I>&gt;<i> will not extend your copyright, and most companies don't have any reason to
</I>&gt;<i> care about the status of their IP in 2210.
</I>
So I was under the impression that a creative work
is covered by copyright as soon as it is fixed in
a tangible medium... no special &quot;copyright&quot; word
required. Statues and paintings don't have 
a (c) sign on them, yet they are still covered.

Then again, I might have been misinformed - and
I am not lawyer either...

But my motivation for suggesting a format for
a license notice at the end of a .gmi file
is a bit different. It is not there to 
make prosecution of &quot;pirates&quot; easier, but to
facilitate reuse.

The corporate world likes to hold on to all
its rights (&quot;all rights reserved&quot;) but
we don't have to - things like BSD, GPL and
CC-* are people saying that they are happy
to contribute to something shared, on certain terms. 
And if these statements are embedded in .gmi files,
tools can be built which parse this. 

Imagine a &quot;greatest quotes in gemini-space&quot;
site/capsule. Or &quot;my favourite sites, long
lost&quot;. Or &quot;a temporary mirror of a slow capsule
about to be slashdotted by me linking to it&quot;.

All these things could be done if the copyright
holders are fine with it... they just need to 
tell us.

regards

marc
