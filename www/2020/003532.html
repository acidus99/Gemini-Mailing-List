This has actually long been a bit of a contentious point in the
Gopherverse, and we have inherited a bit of the controversy, if I
remember much earlier discussions accurately.  There are some people
(a vocal minority?  I'm not sure), who feel that public web proxies
exposing their Gopherhole/capsule to the entire browser-using world are
negating the agency they exercised in very deliberately putting some
content up only on Gopher/Gemini and not the web.  Web proxies force
them to be visible in (and linkable from) a space that they are actively
trying not to participate in.

While I am aware of the ultimate futility of trying to control where
publically served online content ends up, I have some sympathy for this
perspective (perhaps even more so now that we have very nice tools like
your own Kineto by which people who *do* want their content to be
accessible from a browser can achieve this easily).  When the first web
portals for Gemini turned up, some people expressed interest in being
able to opt out, to keep their Gemini-only content truly Gemini-only,
and at least one of those early web portals (portal.mozz.us) agreed to
respect those wishes.  The webproxy user agent I put into the first
robots.txt draft is actually just codifying what portal.mozz.us has
already been doing for many months.  I did not expect its inclusion to
be so controversial.  I *did* try to word it carefully so that personal
webproxies which, e.g. run on a user's local machine and are not
publically accessible need not abide by robots.txt, as those are really
just roundabout Gemini clients.

Cheers,
