<PRE>
  To begin with, I'm going with the titan: scheme, to ensure that this isn't
mixed up with the gemini: scheme itself.

  This proposal is mostly based upon a new URL scheme, and I've spent the
day diving deep into RFC-7595 (URI Scheme Guidelines June 2015, current
standard).  First, the good news---gemini fits the spec for a &quot;Permanent
Status&quot; with the IETF.  Next, these bits from the RFC:

Section 1:

	The URI syntax provides a federated and extensible naming system,
	where each scheme's specification can further restrict the syntax
	and define the semantics of identifiers using that scheme.

Section 3.4:

	Note: It is perfectly valid to say that &quot;no operation apart from GET
	is defined for this URI.&quot;

  Both are quite good for the current definition of the gemini: scheme. 

  It's some other bits from section 3.4 that bodes somewhat well for the
current proposal (with a new scheme) under consideration:

	It is also valid to say that &quot;there's only one operation defined for
	this URI, and it's not very GET-like.&quot; The important point is that
	what is defined on this scheme is described ... The default
	invocation, or dereferencing, of a URI SHOULD be &quot;safe&quot; in the sense
	described by Section 3.4 of [W3CWebArch]; i.e., performing such an
	invocation should not incur any additional obligations by doing so.

[W3CWebArch]	<A HREF="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#safe-interaction">https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#safe-interaction</A>

  So doing a non-GET method based on a scheme is okay.  That's the one thing
I was worried about, as I looked over all the currently registered schemes
[1] appear to *only* specify a location, not an action and a location.  So
the following are &quot;okay&quot; (ish) per the spec:

	titan+put:
	titan+post:
	titan+del:

  Further more, from RFC-6335 (Service Name and Port Number Procedures
August 2011), section 5:

	There may be more than one service name associated with a particular
	transport protocol and port.  There are three ways that such port
	number overloading can occur:

	o  Overloading occurs when one service is an extension of another
	   service, and an in-band mechanism exists for determining if the
	   extension is present or not.

  So I'm still &quot;okay&quot; (ish) with the new URL schemes.  

  I rejected the following URL:

	<A HREF="titan://put@example.com/path/to/new/item">titan://put@example.com/path/to/new/item</A>

  While it's cute, and syntatically correct, semantically it's quite a
stretch---it's not a &quot;user&quot;, it's a &quot;command&quot;, which doesn't semantically
follow as a user nor a location.  It's too much of an abuse for my liking.

  Semantically, I would probably treat these three new schemes differently. 
The first, titan+post: (or titan-post: which is easier to type) would be:

	titan+<A HREF="post://example.com/post-handler/endpoint?size=1234&amp;mime=text/plain">post://example.com/post-handler/endpoint?size=1234&amp;mime=text/plain</A>

  The size and MIME types are part of the query string, as the data being
uploaded is *NOT* a replacement of a resource on the server, must data for a
service to consume, so semantically, it makes sense as a query string.

	titan+<A HREF="put://example.com/path/to/new/resource;size=1234&amp;mime=text/plain">put://example.com/path/to/new/resource;size=1234&amp;mime=text/plain</A>

  Here request is being replaced---there's no &quot;endpoint&quot; per se to receive
the data, so query data doesn't make semantic sense.  The size and MIME type
are inherent properties of the resource being uploaded, so by using the ';'
as a sub-delimeter in the path, it semantically relates to the resource. 
That semantic relationship doesn't exist with a query string.

	tital+<A HREF="del://example.com/path/to/remove">del://example.com/path/to/remove</A>

  Nothing more to say, other than the resource is removed.

  Upon reflection, given the semantic meanings involved, I can cut the
number of new schemes down to just one: &quot;titan:&quot;.  Here are the three
examples again:

	<A HREF="titan://example.com/post-handler/endpoint?size=1234&amp;mime=text/plain">titan://example.com/post-handler/endpoint?size=1234&amp;mime=text/plain</A>
	<A HREF="titan://example.com/path/to/new/resource;size=1234&amp;mime=text/plain">titan://example.com/path/to/new/resource;size=1234&amp;mime=text/plain</A>
	<A HREF="titan://example.com/path/to/remove;size=0">titan://example.com/path/to/remove;size=0</A>

  The logic goes something like this [2]:

	if the request has a query, it's an upload of data---accept data.
	if the request has no query, and the path parameter (marked by ';')
		doesn't exist---error.
	if the request has no query, and the path parameter exists:
		if size==0, delete the resource
		if size&gt;0, accept data and make the resource available.

  So that's my current thinking (other than having a way of Gemini to
reverse the flow).
