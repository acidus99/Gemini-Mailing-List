<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Drew DeVault once stated:
&gt;<i> Unpopular opinion time: Gemini should not have mandatory TLS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - TLS is not conveinent for local development
</I>&gt;<i> - TLS is inherently dependent on a centralized oligarchy of CAs
</I>&gt;<i> - Baking TLS into the protocol is going to be a bad look when The Next
</I>&gt;<i>   TLS comes out
</I>&gt;<i> - Some alternative modes of internet access have built-in encryption
</I>&gt;<i>   guarantees: yggdrasil, cjdns, Tor; and for these adding TLS is
</I>&gt;<i>   redundant (and arguably worse)
</I>
  I won't argue that TLS is a bad choice, but before throwing out
alternatives like yggdrasil, cjdns or noise, instead *just implement the
damn thing* [1][2]---write both a Gemini server and client (for bonus
points---implement ALL THE ENCRYPTIONS!) so the rest of us can see how easy
it is, and *then* we can have an actual discussion about transitioning away
from TLS (or including other mechanisms).

  This has already been done once:

	<A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/000457.html">https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/archives/gemini/2020/000457.html</A>

and the follow-up:

&gt;<i> ####  About my previous proposal
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll have to think harder about it (within my limited cryptographic
</I>&gt;<i> expertise), and perhaps submit it to a cryptographers community for
</I>&gt;<i> feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment I can see only a minor privacy flaw in it:  the client
</I>&gt;<i> discloses its identity (and proof of identity) to any server;  instead
</I>&gt;<i> it should first wait for the server to disclose its identity (and
</I>&gt;<i> proof of identity) before proceeding.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This issue stems from the fact that the ransport_prepare function
</I>&gt;<i> is &quot;symmetrical&quot; and tries to reduce network round-trips;  instead the
</I>&gt;<i> client could first wait for the server verifier and then send its own
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. just a minor change to that function).
</I>

  -spc (Note:  not much from Ciprian since then ... )

[1]	I disagreed with solderpunk about the status codes when he first
	proposed Gemini.  In stead of hashing it out over months, I just
	went ahead and wrote a Gemini server with the status codes I thought
	it should have.  We then spent a few months hashing it out, but at
	least there was an implementation (or two by the time the discussion
	came to an end) backing up the argument(s).

[2]	This applies to anyone, not just Drew.
