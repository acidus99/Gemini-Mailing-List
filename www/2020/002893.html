<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Ali Fardan once stated:
&gt;<i> Greetings follows, I just found out about gemini recently and I got
</I>&gt;<i> interested in the project and wanted to be involved, In the process of
</I>&gt;<i> setting up my gempod (that's how you call them?), I wanted to be able
</I>&gt;<i> to have an HTML/HTTP mirror for my gempod and I haven't found a gemtext
</I>&gt;<i> to HTML converter 
</I>
  Given how easy it is, I'm surprised there aren't more.  But by searching
the mailing list, I did fine reference to two Gemini-text-to-HTML
converters:

	<A HREF="https://github.com/LukeEmmet/GemiNaut/blob/master/GemiNaut/GmiConverters/GmiToHtml.r3">https://github.com/LukeEmmet/GemiNaut/blob/master/GemiNaut/GmiConverters/GmiToHtml.r3</A>
	(written in Rebol, a blast from the past)

	<A HREF="https://git.sr.ht/~sotirisp/qute-gemini">https://git.sr.ht/~sotirisp/qute-gemini</A>
	(Gemini text to Markdown to HTML in python3)

&gt;<i> so I decided to write my own, and in the middle of
</I>&gt;<i> the process I thought if I'm going write a full parser for gemtext,
</I>&gt;<i> I might as well make the code reusable and package it as a library, so
</I>&gt;<i> the project shifted from a gemtext to HTML tool to a gemtext processing
</I>&gt;<i> library, and here I am.
</I>
  Hello.

&gt;<i> As of now, my implementation is complete, It is almost usable for
</I>&gt;<i> anyone willing to test it, I wrote manpages for all functions currently
</I>&gt;<i> implemented, but not for the data types yet, I'm going to work on that,
</I>&gt;<i> and as part of my project, I want to write a manpage for the text/gemini
</I>&gt;<i> format (gemtext(5)) and I want it to be precise and spec compliant,
</I>&gt;<i> if you don't mind, I'll go ahead and write the manpage as a proposal to
</I>&gt;<i> standardize some of the unclear cases of the spec, if the rest of the
</I>&gt;<i> community agrees, maybe get the spec updated too?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Attached is a tarball of my current implementation (WIP)
</I>
  And here are some comments from trying it out.  I wrote a simple Gemini
text file (with very long lines) and ran your test program over it.  In the
output you have some garbage data on the very first line:

00000000: 88 DB CB 23 20 4C 6F 72 65 6D 20 69 70 73 75 6D ...# Lorem ipsum
00000010: 20 64 6F 6C 6F 72 20 73 69 74 20 61 6D 65 74 2C  dolor sit amet,

  Thoughts:  sounds like you have some unitialized memory.  Aside from the
garbage bytes, the output did not match the input as the pre-formatted block
input did not have the ``` guards.  And the last blank line was not included
in the output either.

  I also ran it under valgrind [1] and found a leak in the happy path:

  You will also want to check the non-happy paths for memory leaks.  In my
experience, memory leaks are more likely in the non-happy path because
programmers rarely think through the non-happy path, and it's annoying to
write code to properly handle the non-happy paths in C.

  But I think it's wonderful that there was only one leak, and possibly an
easy one to fix.  The library itself appears easy to use (if you know C). 
Good job.

  -spc

[1]	If you are doing C, and have access to valgrind (it's almost always
	installed on every Linux system, or available to be installed), use
	it.  It is a fantastic tool to find memory leaks and issues with
	unitialized memory.  Yes, it's annoying having to track all the
	issues down, but I feel it's worth it.
