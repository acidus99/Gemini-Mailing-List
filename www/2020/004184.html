Great! I've also added support for using bookmark .gmi files/pages in Lagrange (v1.0).

I'm changing my previous answer now with Lagrange v1.0 having support for remote bookmarks. It solves 80% of the problem, especially if you throw in Dropbox/etc. to sync your bookmark files across devices, or get them via your existing Gemini server.

So what remains is automated upload of added/deleted bookmarks, and for that it seems setting up a custom server might be overkill. The UX benefits of automation are still there, but maybe there is something even simpler that could do the trick.

I'll give it some thought.
