I have read most of the messages in this thread, i would just say that
one  of  the  problems  with  WWW is  that  browser  are  getting  not
manageable by a single user or a hobbyist programmer.

This  issue  lead to  centralization  (see  chromium and  the  company
behind) as most of us can easily see.

Adding  more complexity  and more  responsibility to  software authors
will shrink diversity in the gemini software landscape.

Of  course i  talk here  as  a client  author  here but  in the  niche
language i  chose (common lisp) i  was forced to write  my URL parsing
procedure, adding i18n domains will require  a lot of work because the
third party library  (the only one) Jason McBrayer  wrote some message
above does  not implement  punycode-&gt;unicode conversion (if  i checked
the right library, thanks to the author anyway, better than nothing!).

Probably many of you just thinking &quot;who cares about CL?&quot;, and probably
this is the mindset that lead to the mess it is now the web.

Internationalized  hostname  has  advantages  but  how  this  adding
complexity impact software author? Is this complexity needed?

I have no answer, just would want to express some of my concerns.

Bye!
C.
