<PRE>This kind of sork is like writing a book. It is always tempting to go back
and revize and edit because yu are never happy eith it.

As someone that is lookingto use this on api zero acting as a
tinkerboxservet? I am lookingforward to the serverand client software that
can be written jn this time now that the spec is at least momentarily in
place.

&gt;<i> Greetings all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After today's change to the spec to introduce some new line types, I am
</I>&gt;<i> announcing a three month spec freeze.  I am happy to make small changes
</I>&gt;<i> to correct typos, fixing inconsistencies or reduce ambiguities (and I
</I>&gt;<i> have no doubt the latest change intorduced some of these things).  But I
</I>&gt;<i> will not make any substantive changes until June 1st 2020.  The reason
</I>&gt;<i> for this, as previously stated, is that I think in general we are doing
</I>&gt;<i> far too much &quot;designing in a vacuum&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Designing protocols in the abstract on a mailing list is fun, but there
</I>&gt;<i> will *always* be reasonable arguments for adding just one more thing.
</I>&gt;<i> We'll never be finished and we'll move ever further away from the ethos
</I>&gt;<i> that people should be realistically able to write their own
</I>&gt;<i> feature-complete Gemini software in a weekend or two.  I am strongly of
</I>&gt;<i> the opinion that, now that we have defined something which is
</I>&gt;<i> (hopefully!) manageably small and simple, we should build the best
</I>&gt;<i> possible space we can within the limits that small and simple thing
</I>&gt;<i> imposes, and then ask ourselves &quot;are we content with this?&quot;.  Not
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;wouldn't it be nicer if we also had X?&quot;, because of course it would,
</I>&gt;<i> but &quot;if this really were it, forever, would using this be genuinely
</I>&gt;<i> unpleasant?&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At this point I would really like to consider making changes if and
</I>&gt;<i> only if they fix actual real-world problems which we can point at that
</I>&gt;<i> are affecting multiple non-hypothetical servers or users.  Right now
</I>&gt;<i> there's just not enough stuff out there for this kind of &quot;real world
</I>&gt;<i> driven design&quot; to happen, and until that changes I think our time is
</I>&gt;<i> better used writing content than specs or code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Moving forward, I strongly advocate for a model something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. INTERVAL = 3 months
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Spend INTERVAL actually building Geminispace and associated tools,
</I>&gt;<i>    with no major spec changes.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Ask &quot;What is the *single* biggest problem/shortcoming of the current
</I>&gt;<i>    spec, based on everything that has actually been done or been tried
</I>&gt;<i>    in the past INTERVAL?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Possibly (but not necessarily) change the spec to address the
</I>&gt;<i>    answer to 3, if the problem is deemed bad enough and can be
</I>&gt;<i>    addressed without adding too much extra complexity.
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Set INTERVAL = 2*INTERVAL
</I>&gt;<i> 6. GOTO 2, or END.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This way the protocol solidifies pretty rapidly, and all our attention
</I>&gt;<i> is focussed on demonstrable problems, which are tackled in order of
</I>&gt;<i> severity.  This model strongly encourages solving most problems not
</I>&gt;<i> through changes to the spec, which are precious rareties, but through
</I>&gt;<i> extra layers of optional convention, e.g. defining well-known endpoints
</I>&gt;<i> like robots.txt or sitemap.xml.  This, in turn, minimises breakage of
</I>&gt;<i> existing tooling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, let's spend most of our Gemini energy until June on creating
</I>&gt;<i> content and tools!  In addition to finally starting some gemlogs, I
</I>&gt;<i> still plan to prioritise the creation of an Atom-based aggregator to
</I>&gt;<i> play the role of Bongusta for Geminispace.  This, I hope, will encourage
</I>&gt;<i> content creation by making new content easily discoverable.  In
</I>&gt;<i> Gopherspace, Bongusta and, before Bongusta existed, the SDF phlog
</I>&gt;<i> listing played a strong role in easy content discovery.  Geminispace is
</I>&gt;<i> still stuck with manually checking every known server every day to find
</I>&gt;<i> infrequent updates, which is not something many people are going to want
</I>&gt;<i> to do (even I quickly stopped doing it!).  This discourages writing
</I>&gt;<i> content, due to the feeling that it will never be seen.  Fixing this is,
</I>&gt;<i> I think, important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Solderpunk
