</I>Again, the client can do a lot of work for you in this regard. As we all 
know mostly the heavy content is going to be images and things like 
linked mp3, zip, pdf etc.

Generally speaking a client can examine the URL and make an educated 
assumption about the target mime type from the file extension. Such 
links can be decorated or hinted to the user who may or may not decide 
to download them.

In the upcoming relese of GemiNaut I have implemented a simple 
decoration scheme that lets users infer this form the link. This 
decoration is added by the client irrespective of the server.

=&gt; /normal/path Normal gemini link

These can generally can be assumed to be text/gmi or maybe text/*, no 
extra decoration, so displayed like this:

&#8658; Normal gemini link

=&gt; /path/to/file.png Link to an image

these can be decorated to hint this to the user, so what you actually 
see is this. The icon hints at the content you will likely get.

&#8658; &#128160; Link to an image

Do I want to click on all links to images? Probably not for various 
reasons including bandwidth/performance, and the client helped me make 
that judgement.

At the moment I have an opt in list of the most likely file types that 
might be linked to:

[png gif jpg etc] are images

[mp3 mov pdf zip gz] are decorated as &quot;binary&quot; files

This gives the user a good idea what they will get and helps make a 
choice to click on the link or not

Best wishes
