<PRE>Katarina writes:
&gt;<i>     ``` @embed image/png

</I>
I had not thought of using that space for something like that. This is unfortunate.
However, I am grateful to Katarina for bringing it to our attention. I think this
is important.

I also concur with solderpunk's assessment:
&gt;<i> To be honest, I could live without specifying
</I>&gt;<i> programming languages to enable syntax highlighting in text/gemini - I
</I>&gt;<i> get that that's *nice*, but it's not really essential.  But the alt-text
</I>&gt;<i> thing kind of feels important to me
</I>
I think accessibility is extremely important and that alt text for ascii art
is of great benefit.

I have a branch of my client, Bombadillo, built that supports alt text and
toggling off preformatted block lines in favor of their alt text (or nothing,
if there is no alt text). It works well for what it is trying to do. If alt text
became a part of the spec and was widely encouraged by the community
such that it became standard practice I think it would be really wonderful.
I also see that as a real possible thing that could happen (in a way that HTML
has struggled with).

Of note, that build of Bombadillo does NOT allow any text on the closing line
of a preformatted block. Or at the very least, it will ignore that text. I don't
know that that solves anything for the issues described by Katarina but it
might help.

Another suggestion, and I know this is rough, is to add another block type so
that there is one for readable text and one for art.

Somthing like:

```
    def i_am_a_code_block():
        print(&quot;How do I add alt text?&quot;)
```

~~~
   : - p
~~~

Having the two types makes it fairly non-extensible. It does NOT solve the alt
text problem, which I would still very much like to see. But it does separate out
crawlable content for search engines, allow clients to let their users turn off all
ascii art,hide art for screen readers while allowing them to ask the user if they
want a preformatted text block read to them, and probably a few other uses.

Every way I try to think of adding alt text ends up being arbitrarily extendable
and hidden to users under most circumstances. This is a very big bummer. I
continue to think that alt text is essential for a free and openly expressive
platform that is accessible to all. If anyone has any ideas please post! 

I suppose alt text could have its own tag, but it seems like we'd have the same
issues....
