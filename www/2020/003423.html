<PRE>Hi Geminauts,

I quite agree with this perspective.  The biggest drawback to using Atom
as the standard way to subscribe to serial content on Gemini is not the
difficulty of parsing, but that it requires the authors of such content
to generate the feed file.  I thought this could be addressed with good
tooling, such as my gemfeed program, but real world experience in
helping people use it, and using it myself, has proven this is not
actually straightforward.  The sticking point is the need for
timestamps.  File system timestamps are too easily accidentally changed
to be really useful for this.  Of course the problem is trivially solved
by some kind of static site generator which keeps its own database of
creation/update times and generates the feed, but IMHO it absolutely
should be necessary to use such a system just to make your content
subscribable.  If somebody wants to use such a tool, more power to them,
but ideally one should be able to manage a capsule entirely by hand with
nothing more than a standard text editor if that's what one wants to do,
and still participate in Geminispace as a first class citizen.  Atom
feeds don't fit well with this ideal.

Systems like Spacewalk or Moku Pona (recently updated to support
Gemini!) *do* fit with this ideal.  The content author does not need to
do anything special at all, and users can subscribe to anything at all.
These are extremely desirable properties.  The downside is that these
change-detection systems are fragile (and will erroneously declare a
site to have been updated if all the author did is change a typo or add
some ASCII art above their post list), and provide no meta-data - you
can't see post titles in Spacewalk the way you can in CAPCOM.

I have been thinking for some time now about how to get the best of both
these worlds, and have had Fediverse/email discussions with a few
people about this subject.  Recently I settled on a design and had been
meaning to make some kind of post about it.  Reading this thread, I
realise now I've independently reinvented exactly the same scheme that
Luke Emmet has already implemented!

I would be strongly in favour of some kind of &quot;sidekick standard&quot; (like
robots.txt) defining a process by which *any* text/gemini document can
be interpreted as a feed and subscribed to.  The details would look
roughly like this:

* The text of the first heading line (e.g. # My gemlog) to appear in the
  document is equivalent to the &lt;feed&gt;&lt;title&gt; element of an Atom feed.
  All other heading lines are ignored.
* All other lines which are not link lines are ignored.
* All link lines with labels where the first whitespace-separated
  component of the label is a recognised datestamp are treated as
  equivalent to an Atom &lt;entry&gt; element, where:
    - The link's URL provides &lt;entry&gt;&lt;link&gt;
    - The datestamp provides &lt;entry&gt;&lt;updated&gt;
    - The content of the label after the datestamp provides
      &lt;entry&gt;&lt;title&gt;
* All other link lines are ignored

Ignoring link lines without a datestamp allows for the presence of
&quot;Home&quot; or &quot;Next page in LEO&quot; (I only learned about LEO yesterday - love
it!) links in a subscribable page without having them turn up as entries
in the feed.

All this requires to become a fairly complete spec is a specification of
acceptable datestamp formats.  It seems like Luke Emmet's implementation
of this is flexible in this regard.  I would argue strongly in favour of
supporting only a single format, namely the ISO 8601 format (in which
today is 2020-11-19).  The advantages of this format are:

* There's a complete formal spec for it already available, written and
  maintained by somebody else
* It's linguistically neutral (e.g. does not use English-specific
  abbreviations like &quot;Jun&quot; or &quot;Mon&quot;)
* It's very easily recognised via a simple regex
* Lexicographic sorting is equivalent to chronological sorting.

If all feeds use this format, then an aggregator which subscribes to
multiple feeds (and I realise that Luke's tool is *not* one of these,
so the fact that it is flexible on dates should not be perceived as a
failing) can fetch all its feeds and sort the entries it finds from most
recent to oldest without even having to actually parse the datestamps at
all - they can just be treated as dumb strings.  This substantially
simplifies aggregator design compared to a standard which allows
multiple date formats, or which mandates any other date format.

I am aware this approach does not provide as much information as an Atom
feed does (e.g. it cannot convey per-entry authorship), but it should be
adequate for a majority of real-world cases.  Certainly it would be
adequate for something like the CAPCOM and Spacewalk aggregators
currently in popular use.

I don't want to be perceived as forcing this design upon the community,
but I have given it quite some thought and I really think it's hard to
significantly improve upon.  It would allow for aggregators with all the
best parts of CAPCOM (high resistance to false alarm updates, providing
feed and entry titles in aggregated output) with implementation burdens
much closer to Spacewalk, for both aggregator authors and content
authors.  That's a very Gemini kind of solution. :)  A quick browse of
CAPCOM and Spacewalk suggest the majority of gemlogs are already 100%
compatible with this method of subscription (including all those at
gemlog.blue).  Many which aren't could be very quickly and easily made
so (e.g. by changing 2020/11/19 to 2020-11-19), without any nasty side
effects like changing URLs.

So, if somebody can see serious shortcomings with this approach or needs
clarification of some small details, I'm very happy to discuss it, but
otherwise it would be nice to avoid this becoming yet another endless
bikeshedding expedition, and I'd be happy to bless this approach or one
very similar as &quot;official&quot; quite quickly.  CAPCOM is rapidly approaching
100 feeds, and I would love to see the community move toward norms of
people either running their own private aggregators to read only what
they like, and/or people setting up curated public aggregators specific
to particular special interests, rather than encouraging everybody to
read everything that anybody ever says.  Making subscription
substantially easier could help push us in that direction.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
