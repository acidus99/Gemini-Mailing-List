<PRE>One thing I like to do is build and test Gemini clients on my Linux 
system. It's interesting for me to follow their development, and this is 
currently what I track and build:

Graphical: alrisha, castor, kristall, moonlander
Text: asuka diohsc

AV-98 of course is interpreted so I don't build it, but I do keep it up 
to date along with the rest. My system is currently unable to build 
projects written in Go, so unfortunately I have not been to test 
bombadillo though I have been wanting to. (I think there was one other 
client as well using Go.) The issue seems that I can't connect to Go's 
online repository, so it's an Internet/ISP problem that I'll have to 
figure out how to work around.

All of the clients are fantastic, but none of them are perfect yet! 
Except... elpher! When testing with my own Gemini pages, I find elpher 
renders them exactly how I want/expect. Generally graphical clients all 
have their own funny little quirks, though they are acceptable, while 
the text mode ones are all solid, so no complaints there.

If you have a client that I missed or don't know about I will be glad to 
add it to my system. I also haven't yet found an Android client I can 
use, though I ran across one in source form but can't/won't build things 
for Android so I'd go for a pre-built package.

Ben
