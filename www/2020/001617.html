It didn't get dropped, but goodness, what a relief to get a plaintext
version! :)

That would be just wonderful!  There is so far only one other Android
client to my knowledge, and it's not yet in either of those places.
It's also a little out of date now, with a few spec changes having
happened since it was made.  A more recent Android client available from
F-Droid would make me very happy.

&gt;<i> It's missing client certs, its not clear to me if they actually should be transient or just fully

</I>
The spec will hopefully be a bit clearer on that front quite soon.  But
I still think people writing new clients now would be making an entirely
rational decision to not bother wading into the client cert thing until
some more established conventional workflows have been settled on.  It's
the most &quot;under development&quot; part of the whole thing by far at this
point, and they are also not necessary to view 99% of what's currently
in Geminispace, so there is no need to rush into supporting them.

Cheers,
