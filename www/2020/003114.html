</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/faq.gmi">gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/faq.gmi</A>
</I>
Alright, bet. 2.1.1 in the FAQ says:

&gt;<i> Gemini aims to be simple, but not too simple. Gopher is simpler at
</I>&gt;<i> a protocol level, but as a consequence the client is eternally
</I>&gt;<i> uncertain: what character encoding is this text in? Is this text the
</I>&gt;<i> intended content or an error message from the server? What kind of 
</I>&gt;<i> file is this binary data? Because of this, a robust Gopher client is
</I>&gt;<i> made less simple by needing to infer or guess missing information. 
</I>&gt;<i> Early Gemini discussion included three clear goals with regard to
</I>&gt;<i> simplicity:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * It should be possible for somebody who had no part in designing
</I>&gt;<i> the protocol to accurately hold the entire protocol spec in their
</I>&gt;<i> head after reading a well-written description of it once or twice.
</I>&gt;<i> * A basic but usable (not ultra-spartan) client should fit
</I>&gt;<i> comfortably within 50 or so lines of code in a modern high-level
</I>&gt;<i> language. Certainly not more than 100.
</I>&gt;<i> * A client comfortable for daily use which implements every single
</I>&gt;<i> protocol feature should be a feasible weekend programming project
</I>&gt;<i> for a single developer.
</I>
Adding separate 2x status codes for &quot;feel free to cache this&quot; and 
&quot;don't cache this&quot; would follow:

* It's literally just 2 more numbers to remember, shouldn't be much 
harder than remembering the status codes that exist today.
* A basic but usable client can just ignore 21/22 and act like it
got a 20 response code (that's the point of the 2-digit response
code, AFAICT).
* Implementing some form of caching wouldn't be too hard to add to
a client that &quot;implements every single protocol feature&quot;.

&gt;&gt;<i> How can something that causes less resource usage on the server be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rude to the server, or something I configured or downloaded as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;client that has caching&quot; be rude to me for using it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because the server operates under the assumption that content is not
</I>&gt;<i> cached, if you're serving large files over Gemini you should look
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere else, this is not bittorrent, and if your server is eating up
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of resources, you're doing Gemini wrong, Gemini servers don't
</I>&gt;<i> have to be complicated, that's your own problem. Consider using
</I>&gt;<i> connection queue and serving connections one by instead of forking or
</I>&gt;<i> multithreading because the protocol allows such simple design by
</I>&gt;<i> closing the connection right after the transaction, it's not like in
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP land where you have keep-alive.
</I>
Elitism much? Let me read you 2.1.3, from the very same FAQ you quoted:

&gt;<i> The &quot;first class&quot; application of Gemini is human consumption of
</I>&gt;<i> predominantly written material - to facilitate something like
</I>&gt;<i> gopherspace, or like &quot;reasonable webspace&quot; (e.g. something which is
</I>&gt;<i> comfortably usable in Lynx or Dillo). But, just like HTTP can be, and
</I>&gt;<i> is, used for much, much more than serving HTML, Gemini should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> be used for as many other purposes as possible without compromising the
</I>&gt;<i> simplicity and privacy criteria above. This means taking into account
</I>&gt;<i> possible applications built around non-text files and non-human clients.
</I>
I'm not sure how you read this section, but it seems to me like the intent
is to be able to serve large files if you can.

&gt;&gt;<i> Is not doing everything a server sends being rude to the server
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> operator? If a server sends a 100000000x100000000 image, is my image
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> viewer being rude for refusing to decode/display it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, its being sane, this does not apply here.
</I>
Let me rephrase the question: if a server tells you you can cache the 
response, is your client being rude for refusing to cache it?

&gt;<i> Does everyone here require a lecture on why their desired features
</I>&gt;<i> aren't in the protocol yet? seems to be the common point of discussion
</I>&gt;<i> here, as if the protocol is NOT ENOUGH, I don't know what brought your
</I>&gt;<i> interest here, did you see it as a great way of avoiding the current
</I>&gt;<i> scope creep of the modern web, or as a playground to satisfy your bad
</I>&gt;<i> ideas?
</I>
Again, your elitism is showing. I feel like adding a way to signal 
whether or not you can safely cache a response isn't really sacrificing 
any of the Gemini ethos: simplicity, privacy, or generality.

&gt;<i> If any feature does not add a great value at an acceptable cost to the
</I>&gt;<i> simplicity of the protocol, consider it rejected before even proposing
</I>&gt;<i> it, I don't want to have a different experience browsing Gemini space
</I>&gt;<i> using netcat than using Kristall.
</I>
I fail to see how adding &quot;safe to cache&quot; and &quot;do not cache&quot; status codes 
would make using netcat different from Kristall or any other client. Just 
treat it as a 2x success status code, and move on.

Just my two cents,
Robert &quot;khuxkm&quot; Miles
