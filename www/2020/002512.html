<PRE>(mirrored at <A HREF="gemini://breadpunk.club/bakers/breadw/slices/1598160221.gmi">gemini://breadpunk.club/bakers/breadw/slices/1598160221.gmi</A>)

Thanks to sloum's wonderful work at
=&gt; <A HREF="gemini://gemlog.blue">gemini://gemlog.blue</A>
as well as their generosity in sharing their codebase with me, I'm pleased to announce that breadpunk.club now has a web-facing gemini authorship tool:
=&gt; <A HREF="https://slice.breadpunk.club">https://slice.breadpunk.club</A>

Bakers at breadpunk.club are now able to author posts in their gemini capsules on the web, without using ssh, ftp, or other protocols that might be blocked (as is the case for me!).  As of now, all posts will appear in a slices/ subdirectory in bakers' user capsules, but I might try and change it to allow editing of any URL the baker owns.

If you're not already a baker at breadpunk.club, you can join through the instructions at <A HREF="https://breadpunk.club/join/.">https://breadpunk.club/join/.</A>

To get started, ssh into breadpunk.club and create a sigil file at ~/.slice.  Immediately afterward, go to
=&gt; <A HREF="https://slice.breadpunk.club/reg.php">https://slice.breadpunk.club/reg.php</A>
to register your username and password with slice.  That should be it!  You can start posting immediately.

I hope this makes it easier for some of our bakers update their breadlogs (which don't necessarily have to be about bread, by the way!).  I know I will be.

# Notes

Much of slice's functionality is the same as gemlog.blue's -- you can add &quot;slices,&quot; or posts; you can edit and delete them; and you can update your password or delete your whole slice directory.  In the future, I want to enable users to edit their slice index.gmi, add options to &quot;auto-title&quot; slices, and possibly edit anything in their public_gemini folders.

I'd love to hear what other ideas yall have, or thoughts or concerns or whatever!  I *think* my code is secure, but I'm pretty green, so who knows?  (Should I be admitting that on the internet?)
