<PRE>That's a good idea. It would probably work fine for this particular case.
Though I'd worry about it for anything more complicated. But I guess that
could be solved by client-side certs.

As an aside, I had a co-worker who made a web game once and added IP-based
rate limiting. The only trouble was that the only people who played his
game were his co-workers who mostly played from the office network, totally
triggering his rate limit.
