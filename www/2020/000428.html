<PRE>Now that the line-wrapping issue seems to be sorted, at long last, the
next thing I want to quickly clear up is whether or not we really do
want some kind of pre-formatted text mode (the thing we've been
discussing with ``` syntax).

All the header/list stuff we've talked about is definitely - and always
was definitely - going to be optional and ignorable by simple clients.
So I don't feel as strong a need to build consensus on that, and I'm
pretty sure I'm going to spec it.  But verbatim mode would likely be an
obligatory thing to implement, if only because if it's in the spec at
all, some authors will produce content with would-be Gemini links in it,
under the expectation that clients won't try to parse them as links
because they're within a verbatim text block.  Some of these lines may
not actually use valid link syntax, for the purposes of teaching newbies
how *not* to format their links, so clients which ignore the ``` lines
may find themselves in trouble (although, ideally, all clients should be
robust against malformed link lines - Sean, is that in the torture
test?).

I don't think there's any question that such a facility would have
legitimate and useful applications, the quesiton is whether they provide
enough value to be worth the increased implementation effort - which,
for the record, is quite low.

The only reason I think this is worth questioning is that the *original*
reason having such a feature was proposed on this list was as a
work-around to our old style of text reflow breaking lists.  The idea
was that bulleted lists could be enclosed in ``` lines to prevent the
lines all getting joined together.  This was never a great solution in
the first place (as was discussed on the list, it just meant that
content would display weirdly if any individual list item was longer
than a single line on a given client's display), and now it is totally
unecessary as our new line-wrapping solution doesn't break lists, or
poems, or source code.

As far as I see it, the main arguments in favour of a preformatted block
concept now are:

1. The ability to include text/gemini syntax without it actually being
   rendered by the client, so Gemini can be discussed/taught over
   Gemini.
2. The ability to insist that some content (e.g. source code, ASCII
   art), be rendered in a monospace font, even by graphical clients
   which might display text in a variable width font by default.

Point 2. could in principle be nullified by mandating the use of
monospace fonts for all clients, but I think this is a pretty bad idea
and conflicts with the idea that clients should be *able* to make
reading text/gemini a typographically pleasant experience.

I think the case is strong enough to spec these, but I recall at least
one person already suggested we shouldn't, so I'm willing to hear
counter arguments, if anybody wants to provide them.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
