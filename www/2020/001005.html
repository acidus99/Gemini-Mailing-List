This was the thing that stood out most on my first read-through of the
spec! I particularly like the insistence &quot;Transient certificates MUST
NOT be generated automatically&quot;. I wasn't here for the earlier
discussion but I assume this is to fend off servers making sessions
purely for tracking purposes by default.

&gt;<i>   Right now, AV-98 fills the &quot;Subject&quot; of transient certs with

I've seen similar problems before with custom usage of X.509. It would
be nice to use something smaller than UUID if possible just to keep
cert size down - provided there is library support as you noted.

&gt;<i> There is a third scenario, which the spec does not explicitly discuss at

</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> We could change 62 to specify that the META should be a plain-language

</I>&gt;<i> different applications may want different or additional user
</I>&gt;<i> information, and using META to convey this information could work well.
</I>
I'm not a big fan of using certificate fields for anything meaningful
- it's a side channel (surrounded by lots of other fields that people
might be tempted to use) - and it slightly increases the complexity of
integration between the TLS library and the client/server code.

When a server wants the client to use a non-disposable certificate
there is an ambiguity. Is it just because they want the user to
preserve their authentication for more than 24 hours for convenience?
Or is it because the user will permanently lose access to their
account if they ever lose that key?

Much like a bitcoin wallet, the latter is technically a very tidy and
secure solution but it absolutely sets up users to fail. People who
are auto-generating this authentication in regular clients will lose
their keys and be sad about it. By comparison, those who are setting
up whitelisted keys out-of-band are likely more savvy and know what
they're getting into.

With this in mind, my current opinion is that there should be no way
for a server to request a non-disposable certificate. Where
authentication is required, it should be done in-band via a password
or username/password 10 responses as you noted, which is then
associated on the server with the transient certificate. It then
becomes the responsibility of clients to ask the user &quot;how long do you
want to stay authenticated to this website?&quot; If it times out, they can
simply repeat their authentication.

One argument against is that it encourages clients to choose very lax
deletion policies to reduce friction. This may not be as big a concern
as it is on the web, since users will presumably only have a session
with a small fraction of the gemini sites they visit, so they are not
picking up transient tracking sessions willy nilly that need to be
flushed out.

One final thought: do we need a way to encourage clients to have
multiple certificates for the same server, depending on path? If I
authenticate to a CGI application on a multi-user server I don't
necessarily want my identity to be followed by everybody else's
applications on that server.

Cheers,

Tom
