  I thought about autodetection---Unicode is defined in blocks, where each
alphabet becomes a defined block in Unicode.  I then realized that there are
multiple languages that use the European block.  Sure, detecting Greek is
easy since they have their own alphabet, but what about Spanish, French and
German?  They use the same alphabet.

  Nice idea, but there are some tough issues to address.

&gt;<i> I'm not sure I see the point in the encoding part, though...

</I>
  Think legacy documents.  And not every legacy encoding scheme can round
trip through Unicode---I recall there being issues with several east Asian
languages (Chinese, Japanese in particular).

&gt;<i> another interesting point, what specification is the lang= tag?
</I>
  Solderpunk mentioned RFC-1766, which uses the two letter standard for
languages.

&gt;<i> it should probably encouraged to use some special use codes too, taking ISO 639-2 as example
</I>&gt;<i> (standard specifying three-letter codes for languages):
</I>&gt;<i> mis, for &quot;uncoded languages&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> mul, for &quot;multiple languages&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> und, for &quot;undetermined&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> zxx, for &quot;no linguistic content; not applicable&quot;;
</I>
  I buy that.
