<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; That would be great, the first thing I tried to do was visit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; flounder.online in my Gemini browser but it didn't work of course.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Otherwise it's a bit confusing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Based on my research, it looks like the most mature tool for this
</I>&gt;<i> is Molly Brown with CGI -- getting it working might be a weekend
</I>&gt;<i> project for me.

Good luck! There's also the Jetforce server which supports CGI very
well. It's written in Python.

&gt;<i> [url discussion]
</I>
I think encouraging all users to write <A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> is not the way to go.
I feel like it's a potentially annoying UX point, and isn't meaningful
to anyone using flounder but not Gemini.

Personally I'd suggest letting people use whatever they want, and
translating on the fly if they're using the &quot;wrong&quot; protocol for the
request.

&gt;<i> a way to let people use simple tags like @alex and then translate that
</I>&gt;<i> into a gemini URL on gemini or an https url on https.
</I>
This sounds pretty cool! I still the above is useful though.

gemlog.blue source code is here btw:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could you explain more? I don't know Rust but I'd be happy to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically the issue is -- a common use case would be for someone to want to link another flounder page from their page, for example I might link
</I>&gt;<i> my friend juliet.flounder.online's page from alex.flounder.online. A user who is using Flounder through a web app may use the link <A HREF="https://juliet.flounder.online">https://juliet.flounder.online</A>
</I>&gt;<i> which isn't ideal when accessing it through gemini, since the link brings them out of Gemini. I think the solution is to instruct users to use
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> links for other Flounder pages (and maybe put something in the UI that encourages this) and then convert <A HREF="gemini://x.flounder.online">gemini://x.flounder.online</A>
</I>&gt;<i> to <A HREF="https://x.flounder.online">https://x.flounder.online</A> when rendering it over https (right now I use the mozz.us proxy). I could also force this translation by modifying users' text when they save a file with
</I>&gt;<i> an <A HREF="https://x.flounder.online">https://x.flounder.online</A> link but I'm not a fan of that. Maybe I could create some sort of warning that explains this, or even better I could come up
</I>&gt;<i> with a way to let people use simple tags like @alex and then translate that into a gemini URL on gemini or an https url on https.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; The twtxt protocol sounds cool, and good addition to the small web.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think there was a discussion earlier in the mailing list that inspired my idea!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Finally, you should check out gemlog.blue if you haven't already, on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Web and Gemini. It's a similar project, but with a slightly different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; focus, as the posts are only available on Gemini.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is very cool! I'll definitely have to glean some ideas from this
