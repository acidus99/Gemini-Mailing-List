<PRE>Hello
&gt;<i> I understand entirely where you are coming from.  An idea I've had for
</I>&gt;<i> a while now (I don't remember if I've mentioned it here before) is that
</I>&gt;<i> it would be nice if a graphical Gemini browser used a different
</I>&gt;<i> foreground and background colour (and perhaps even a different font?)
</I>&gt;<i> for different domains (subdomains)?  This would be something the client
</I>&gt;<i> would do itself, with no possibility of control or influence from the
</I>&gt;<i> server - it would just use the domain as the seed to a PRNG which chose
</I>&gt;<i> a new scheme.  This would then give different sites their own subtly
</I>&gt;<i> distinct look and feel, which a user could learn to recognise in time.
</I>&gt;<i> I have no idea how feasible this is: programmatically generating
</I>&gt;<i> genuinely pleasant colour schemes is certainly not straightforward.
</I>
This is interesting, something like the sigils in Urbit, or Gravitar 
that are automatically generated from
some identifier?

<A HREF="https://urbit.org/blog/creating-sigils/">https://urbit.org/blog/creating-sigils/</A>

<A HREF="https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/">https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/</A>

And so when you were on a &quot;site&quot; the content would be labelled/decorated 
in a simple yet consistent way

I think that could work.

If it is for the client to decide, how do we determine the &quot;scope&quot; of a 
site:

1.  If it is one per domain then that works, but I suppose that is not a 
universal
     assumption a client can make as many gemini spaces might be hosted 
on the same domain.

2. Full path - is very specific, but it would mean the placemarker would 
change with every request.

3. The author indicates it somehow

4. ?

It would be good perhaps if the author could optionally provide a seed 
site id as part of the content.

e.g. &quot;site-name: Mysite&quot; or other such pre-defined, not extensible 
syntax (we have headings, bullets, links...). Maybe the @symbol is 
awaiting such a role

&quot;@ MySite&quot;

This can be ignored by any disinterested client and is just text in the 
document that CLI readers can read without polluting the content with 
metadata.

&gt;<i> The idea of favicons has been mentioned before in a gemlog post:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="gemini://mozz.us/journal/2020-04-17.gmi">gemini://mozz.us/journal/2020-04-17.gmi</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a couple of big concerns here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One is that right now Gemini is strictly one-request-per-resource and a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of people, myself included, consider that a really desirable
</I>&gt;<i> property.  Anything like favicons or CSS would remove that property, no
</I>&gt;<i> matter how light weight they were.  It's true that at least the second
</I>&gt;<i> request would go to the same server as the first so this doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> actually destroy predictability or control of which servers your client
</I>&gt;<i> connects to, which is one of the arguments in favour of the one request
</I>&gt;<i> thing.
</I>
I don't see the single request per resource is really violated here, 
since it is optional and not required to understand the content. But if 
that is really a worry
the client side option might work.

Maybe the favicon thing is just a convention that authors could include 
or not. The client could search up the url path and show the first one 
it finds, or none


&gt;<i> Another is that, philosophically, I kind of feel like styling *should*
</I>&gt;<i> be under the control of the client and not the server.
</I>That is OK, but maybe the server can hint.
&gt;<i>   Some people have
</I>&gt;<i> strong preferences for light text on dark backgrounds, for example,
</I>&gt;<i> because they have problems with eye strain the other way around.
</I>Agree
&gt;<i> Right
</I>&gt;<i> now on the web this is really only possible if the author deigns to
</I>&gt;<i> provide the option (as Stack Overflow recently did, to much fanfare).  I
</I>&gt;<i> think that's totally backwards.  Give the power over styling to the
</I>&gt;<i> people who actually have to read the content, let them read your stuff
</I>&gt;<i> in the way that works best for their eyesight and that *they* find
</I>&gt;<i> aesthetically pleasing.  I realise this reduces some of the scope for
</I>&gt;<i> self-expression on the part of Gemini content authors, but there's more
</I>&gt;<i> than enough scope for that in the actual *content* they produce (if not,
</I>&gt;<i> there are bigger problems...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be much more interested in us exploring innovative possibilities
</I>&gt;<i> which are strictly under the control of the client, like keying the
</I>&gt;<i> styling to the domain as I mentioned earlier.  I'm not saying that exact
</I>&gt;<i> approach necessarily is the best way to do it, or even a good way.  But
</I>&gt;<i> it's *a* way to do it which doesn't run afoul of any of the issues above
</I>&gt;<i> and that kind of out-of-the-box thinking is a good direction to take,
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO.
</I>
