<PRE>Hi Sean

Thanks for the new tests - I think they are all reasonable, even the 
last one.

I just ran them on GemiNaut and I believe it is doing the right thing 
for all of them, which is to wrap at the word, hyphen or soft-hypen. But 
I shouldn't claim much credit, I'm just using a system control to 
display the text content, which does the hard work of rendering the 
unicode into the display.

For tests 43, 46 and 49, it is unclear in the test what you expect 
should happen. Do you just want the client to confirm it doesn't barf on 
the content, but can display it somehow? For these I don't agree that 
the client should try to split the content as doing so is a non-trivial 
problem and for a real language is very language specific (where are the 
syllable boundaries perhaps). So the correct thing to do is to simply 
lay them out in a non-wrapped line. Or if your client takes a hard line 
it could arbitrarily break the content up (perhaps on mobile).

I think the main thing is that the character content is displayed and 
the client can continue. I think the preference should be for an 
unwrapped line with a scrolling mechanism.

A suggestion for a possible improvement - it would be helpful if there 
was a &quot;back to tests index&quot; link on each page, that way you can choose a 
few tests from the index, then go back to the index when you are done - 
otherwise you might have to go back N times, which is not quite as nice.

Best Wishes

  - Luke
