Oh, sure. I do think those are two different use cases, though:
authentication and authorization. It's not just easier to implement
(because I don't really understand the nitty gritty of TLS) but it also
involves a design goal of mine regarding anonymous collaboration.

That's how I understand client certificates, in any case:

If we're using temporary client certificates, then nothing is gained.
In a wiki context, we don't need to know about sessions. We don't need
to know that this edit was made by the same person that made the other
edit a few minutes ago. (And in fact, Gemini Wiki computes a changing
&quot;code&quot; for each contributor and stores that, hopefully allowing us to
discern visually whether two edits made a few minutes appart are
probably made by the same person without allowing us to know whether
two edits made days appart were made by the same person.)

If we're using permanent client certificates, we've again gained
perpetual sessions which we don't need, or we're using the client
certificats to hand out capabilities: who is an admin, who is an
editor, who is a visitor, who is banned. We're using them for
autorization. I'd like to avoid thinking about that as part of Titan,
though. It's already part of Gemini. If anybody needs this, like they
want to restrict people to uploads to their own area of a site, then
that's fine. That's already covered by Gemini, as far as I'm concerned.

For my use case, tokens straddle that middle ground of anonymous
editing, web of trust, friends of friends, and password protection. We
can pass tokens on to friends and friends of friends, and if it breaks
down, we will issue a new set of tokens. These will again spread from
person to person (or to anybody who knows where to look them up). That
is, in any case, how I would like it to be. &#128516;

And if we really want, then of course we can tie tokens to users, make
them into bearer tokens like they are used in OAuth2: somewhere, you
make an account, you generate a token, and use it for your Gemini
client. On the original site, you can invalidate the token, or the
person running the server can invalidate the token, the token can be
associated with different capabilities, and so on. Tokens allow us to
go there... but we don't have to.

Anyway, Gemini Wiki has the notion of &quot;spaces&quot; &#8211; separate wikis hosted
within the same software. These spaces could be tied to client
certificates, for example, allowing people to have personal wikis that
are effectively read-only for others. The software isn't there, yet,
but it's something on my radar, for sure. I'm expecting that this will
work without having to change anything about Titan because client
certificates are already part of Gemini &#8211; and if I go there, I might
decide that those spaces either don't need tokens, or I might decide
that within those spaces, the people with the right client certificate
are admins and get to generate and invalidate local tokens for their
friends and family. Then we can have both: authentication for admins,
and simple token-based authorization for collaborators.

Cheers
Alex
