<PRE>Hello,

Flounder looks awesome, nice work. It's a beautiful website, and
looks great on Gemini too. To my knowledge this is the first time
gemtext has been used like this outside Gemini, like as a generic
format.

&gt;<i> I want to create more dynamic content (e.g. the homepage), but
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't prioritized that work yet.
</I>
That would be great, the first thing I tried to do was visit
flounder.online in my Gemini browser but it didn't work of course.
Otherwise it's a bit confusing.

&gt;<i> I also have yet to find a great way of translating links between
</I>&gt;<i> gemini / https (right now it's via proxy)
</I>
Could you explain more? I don't know Rust but I'd be happy to
help idea-wise.

The twtxt protocol sounds cool, and good addition to the small web.

Finally, you should check out gemlog.blue if you haven't already, on
the Web and Gemini. It's a similar project, but with a slightly different
focus, as the posts are only available on Gemini.

Cheers,
makeworld

</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; <A HREF="https://flounder.online/">https://flounder.online/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a simple website builder, kind of like Geocities for Gemini. I have

</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/shizaru/">https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/shizaru/</A>), where files are limited to

</I>&gt;<i> interested in its principles politically or philosophically but lack the
</I>&gt;<i> technical abilities to use some of the existing tools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also implement twtxt -- The twtxt protocol fits really well with
</I>&gt;<i> Gemini. It seems to be almost entirely inactive, but I think it's neat.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now, I'm only serving static content on Gemini via Agate. I want

</I>&gt;<i> prioritized that work yet. I also have yet to find a great way of
</I>&gt;<i> translating links between gemini / https (right now it's via proxy) It's
</I>&gt;<i> still very early in development, but it's usable and people seem to be
</I>&gt;<i> having fun so far. Feel free to join if you're interested!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can find the Rust code here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/alexwennerberg/flounder">https://github.com/alexwennerberg/flounder</A> I'd love any feedback or
