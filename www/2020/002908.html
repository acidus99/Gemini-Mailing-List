<PRE>&gt;<i> - In 5.5.2 it is stated that lines beginning with &quot;* &quot; are elements of
</I>&gt;<i> an unordered list, and I assumed the space after '*' is required since
</I>&gt;<i> it is included in the double quotes, when I asked for clarification on IRC,
</I>&gt;<i> others suggested I handle '*' with or without space afterwards, so I
</I>&gt;<i> did.
</I>
I would disagree with this. Originally there was no space required in the
spec, but this was changed, because some people may start lines with
asterisks as an &quot;ASCII-art&quot; way to show emphasis. To allow this writing
style to continue, you should require the space after the asterisk. This is
what the spec defines.

&gt;<i> - In 5.5.3, I had the same question with quotes, the spec says &quot;&gt;&quot; which
</I>&gt;<i> sounds like there should be no space after &quot;&gt;&quot;, and if there is a space,
</I>&gt;<i> I should treat it like a part of the quote, I asked on IRC if I should
</I>&gt;<i> follow that behaviour but others also recommended that I should handle
</I>&gt;<i> spaces after &quot;&gt;&quot; just in case, which leaves me to think again if the
</I>&gt;<i> spec intended that or not.
</I>
Initially no line markers required a space after them. The list line marker
now does, as I described above, but the quote line marker was not changed,
as there doesn't seem to be a reason to. There doesn't seem to be writing
styles that start lines with a '&gt;', but aren't referring to a quote. Working
without the space also follows markdown, which is a plus.

Cheers,
