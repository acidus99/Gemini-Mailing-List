&gt;<i> Hello, Geminispace!
</I>
Yo,

welcome to gemini!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [&#8230;]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One last question: Gemininauts (please oh please let that be a word)
</I>&gt;<i> with twinlogs, how do you decide what to cross-post and what to keep
</I>&gt;<i> {WWW,gemini,gopher}-exclusive? I'm leaning towards keeping my weblog
</I>&gt;<i> more &quot;professional&quot; and my gemlog less filtered, leaving the shortest
</I>&gt;<i> bits for the Fediverse. I'm curious to know how you all handle this.
</I>
I&#8217;m serving the exact same content on both the HTTP and gemini version
(and, when I&#8217;ll eventually start serving the site under gopher I&#8217;ll
serve the exact same content there), but I see why one would like to
differentiate the content.  In my case, I have a clojure script to
generate the sites and a edn file (think of it like a JSON if you
prefer) with a list of posts and pages, I think I can add a
:<i>gemini-only? or :http-only? key to each post to decide where to post
</I>to.

I see that you maintain two different version of each post, one in
markdown and one in gemtext and, if that&#8217;s fine for you, cool.  I&#8217;m too
lazy to maintain two different version of the same content, so I&#8217;m
writing all the &#8220;new&#8221; entries in text/gemini and converting them to HTML
for WWW consumption.

I&#8217;m happy with the replacement of markdown with gemtext, in my use case
at least.  Before, I always had to double &#8211; or triple &#8211; check the posts
before publishing in a web browser to ensure that what I wrote was
exactly what the markdown parser thought (I cannot remember the correct
syntax for images/links and I always forget to put an empty line before
the lists, for instance).  With gemtext I can write and publish directly
from my editor, and I&#8217;m confident that both the gemini and the WWW
version are OK.  Another thing is the lack of inline formatting
(emphasis, code, etc).  At first I found it limiting, but after I while
I got used to, and now I can see that I was exaggerating with the
formatting.  The entries are more clear now, I think.

The result isn&#8217;t bad, the &#8220;one link per line&#8221; can still be weird at
times, but with a bit of CSS it&#8217;s too bad, and my converter has a
heuristic: link to *(png|jpg) gets converted to inline images (I&#8217;m
serving less than 10 images, and all from my domain, so it works for
me).

&gt;<i> I just started writing a series on resilient git-based project setup,
</I>&gt;<i> inspired by Sourcehut and all the conversations since the youtube-dl
</I>&gt;<i> takedown (and subsequent re-instatement).
</I>
looking forward to it ;)

&gt;<i> Next up: set up a Gemini ring and web ring. Then maybe complete the
</I>&gt;<i> trifecta with a Gopher hole.
</I>
it&#8217;s also on my todo-list

&gt;<i> Anyway, thanks for making Gemini awesome.
</I>&gt;<i>
