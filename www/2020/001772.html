I strongly agree with this. For me, the attraction of Gemini is that the
web is no longer a suitable protocol for document delivery, because most
sites require very large, complex browsers that are optimized for use as
an application runtime. If every webserver were running Shizaru, I could
use a reasonable browser like Lynx or Dillo, but that's not realistic
today. I want a document-sharing ecosystem that is not going to expand
to require runtimes for untrusted remote applications.

I don't really feel that we are lacking in file copying protocols, or
that any of the existing file copying protocols are problematic in the
same way that http(s) is. While some of them (SCP? Rsync over SSH?
git+ssh?) may be complex to implement from scratch, they also are mostly
encapsulated by small programs that can be scripted. I also realize
titan: is a separate protocol, but I'm not sure it does the same job as
Gemini of solving a problem that needs to be solved. I'm afraid it's
more like the tendency of the web to replace all other protocols with
extensions of itself.
