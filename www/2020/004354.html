You're kind of correct in the sense that if we just treat the request as
arbitrary bytes and not as an IRI (no validation, no handling at all),
it's simple, but I don't think that's the right way to look at this
issue. Instead, it's about the complexity of proper URI handling vs
proper IRI handling. Not to mention that IRIs can still have
percent-encoded characters!

After thinking about this for a while, the biggest issue for me is that
this is a breaking change. Breaking in the sense that it breaks *every
single compliant server we already have*! If gemini, which has been
surprisingly good at resisting breaking spec changes, accepts this, I
don't see any reason to believe that it won't happen again and again,
for equally silly reasons.
