<PRE>It was thus said that the Great Felix Quei&#223;ner once stated:
&gt;<i> Hey Sean and others!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *snips the whole protocol description*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was too working on a gemini extension to allow arbitrary data uploads
</I>&gt;<i> as &quot;10 INPUT&quot; is a bit too restricted to ~700 byte of data payload.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But now that i read your gemini+put and gemini+delete extension, i think
</I>&gt;<i> i don't need to continue braining over my extension and it's flaws.
</I>
  I'm curious as to what you were planning.  Care to share?

&gt;<i> I really like the proposal. It's easy to implement and integrate both on
</I>&gt;<i> server and client side. The &quot;gemini+delete&quot; scheme is just the normal
</I>&gt;<i> gemini handling routine and the upload routine can be put &quot;in front&quot; of a
</I>&gt;<i> normal gemini request and can be handled with the normal response handler.
</I>
  I wouldn't be too sure about that.  My own &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; took about
five hours to write, and it's a separate server of its own.  I did that
because trying to integrate the new URL support would have been too invasive
of a change in GLV-1.12556.

  And while the protocol itself is easy, there were issues I had to be very
cautious about to ensure nothing bad happened when a delete was called for. 
For instance, I had to account for the deletion of a directory and
everything below it.  I also had to handle the creation of multiple
directories for the put method.
