&gt;<i> 7. It's of no practical use today, here and now, for &quot;everyday users&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> but I just want to get it on the record that in a hypothetical future
</I>&gt;<i> where IPv6 or something else has provided us all with abundant
</I>&gt;<i> publically reachable addresses, the obvious and elegant way for a
</I>&gt;<i> client to upload to a Gemini &quot;server&quot; is actually to just host the
</I>&gt;<i> resource itself, on a random, one-use-only URL, and then send that URL
</I>&gt;<i> as a query to a well-known uploading endpoint on the other end,
</I>&gt;<i> whereupon the &quot;server&quot; briefly becomes a client and fetches the resource
</I>&gt;<i> in the usual way.  Nothing extra needed in the protocol at all!
</I>
As much as i like the idea, as much i see it fail in the current world
of ISPs.
Real world example:
I was developing the finger implementation for Kristall on the train,
using a mobile hotspot. I had neither the possibilty to use
<A HREF="finger://ping@cosmic.voyage">finger://ping@cosmic.voyage</A> from either my mobile phones hotspot as well
as the public wifi in the train, as the firewalls prevent pinging,
NATing and everything else.

Most &quot;normal&quot; people I know don't even have a computer anymore, owning
pretty much only tablets and mobile phones. If we want to get these guys
on the train as well as possible content creators, we need to provide an
easy way of uploading resources to gemini space via a client request,
not a reverse-server.

Afaik it also isn't possible from some mobile devices to activly use
most of the network features (like listing on sockets, using UDP on some
devices is completly disabled, ...)

IPv6 will probably not change this ever

And that's why i want to have some kind of company protocol or built-in
facility in Geminispace to get people on the train that are not tech
savvies.
I'm aware that we as the tech guys often forgot that most people on a
computer don't have any idea how those machines actually work and
requiring them to have a reverse-server for content uploads is just
impossible to explain and must be &quot;hidden&quot; in a client to be able to
probive them content changing options&#8230;

The question is now: Do we want to have those people on the train as
content creators or should gemini have a nice and easy way to have
content creators do their thing?

It's sad, but that's my view on reality
