Thank you, but actually, I deeply regret making that email my first
response to this thread.  Please, nobody else reply to it.  I believe in
and stand by everything I said, but let's be honest, it's nothing
everybody hasn't heard before.  The people who are already sold on
ubiquitous crypto are, well, already sold, and the people who aren't
probably never will be.  The last thing we need is this thread - which
is already a distraction from work on Gemini proper - diverging into a
long and heated argument about cryptopolitics.  I regret letting myself
get worked up over what is a personal hot topic for me.

I'll reply again tomorrow with a more level-headed response.  I do have
other things to say on this - there are issues of fundamentally
incompatible targets of optimisation (really low energy consumption and
really low latency are at odds with one another) and about understanding
what Gemini's realistic niches are (regarding really low energy
consumption, I am full of enthusiasm for radical solarpunk utopia
visions of an alternative internet, but I don't think Gemini fits there
- it's full of &quot;old world internet&quot; ideas - client-server architecture,
location-based addressing, etc.  It has no real place in a future world
of solar-powered RaspberryPis forming small local mesh networks with
inter-village data transfer performed by vegans riding bikes with
saddlebags full of USB sticks).  And, of course, the actual role/status
of the Mercury thought experiment.

Cheers,
Solderpunk
