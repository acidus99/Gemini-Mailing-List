<PRE>It was thus said that the Great <A HREF="https://lists.orbitalfox.eu/listinfo/gemini">colecmac at protonmail.com</A> once stated:
&gt;<i> &gt; I'm sorry, but the two languages I work in donot have an implementation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of punycode in their standard library.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't this somewhat irrelevant in this case? 
</I>
  It was more a comment about this quote:

&gt;<i> There is an implemention of Punycode in every standard library,
</I>&gt;<i> whatever your language.
</I>
  There is *not* an implementation of punycode in every standard library,
whatever your language.  In a lot of currently in-use languages?  Probably,
but not *all*.  

&gt;<i> It's unfortunate they don't
</I>&gt;<i> have an implementation, but as it stands right now, most Gemini clients
</I>&gt;<i> will not handle Unicode domain names at all. 
</I>
  And I'm not seeing anyone else trying to update clients to do this, even
if in an exploratory nature.  What?  Are they just waiting for a decree?

&gt;<i> Punycoding domains will
</I>&gt;<i> solve that issue, and languages that don't have it in their stdlib
</I>&gt;<i> can either use a third-party library, or if that's not possible then
</I>&gt;<i> those languages will just ignore punycoding entirely. 
</I>
  Poking around the GNU libidn documentation, I found Appendix B [1]
worrisome because the IDN rabbit hole just got deeper with U+2024 (ONE DOT
LEADER) and U+2485 (DIGIT FIVE FULL STOP).  Should I worry about it?  I
don't know.  This internationalization stuff is complex and makes me want to
throw up hands in the air, scream a bit, and go back to the simplicity of
ASCII.

  In the end, I'll probably just do Unicode normalization, then punycode and
call it a day.

&gt;<i> Obviously that's
</I>&gt;<i> not great for those languages, but it doesn't make sense to me to not
</I>&gt;<i> have punycoding at all because of that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the end of the day, Gemini clients must be allowed to support Unicode
</I>&gt;<i> domains. Perhaps the term &quot;SHOULD&quot; as defined by RFC2119 should be used
</I>&gt;<i> in the spec in this case.
</I>
  So when are you going to update gemget and Amfora to support punycode? 
I've heard it's easy to do.  Or are you waiting for a spec change first?

  -spc (Seriously, I feel like I'm the only one *doing* anything here)
