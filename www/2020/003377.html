With respect to RFC3986, it's not a matter of opinion.

It's very much not an implementation specific hack. It's defined in RFC
3986 as &quot;relative-ref&quot;, a &quot;network-path reference&quot; specifically.
Non-URIs of the &quot;example.com/hello&quot; style on the other hand are an
implementation specific hack, as you've noted, discouraged by RFC 3986
and not specified in any of the syntaxes it defines. It's obviously
unsuitable for links because it's ambiguous with relative-ref.

Gemini however explicitly only allows &quot;absolute URL&quot; in requests. It
also says that &quot;If the scheme of the URL is not specified, a scheme of
<A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A> is implied.&quot;

In terms of RFC 3986, this is nonsense. &quot;<A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A>&quot; isn't the scheme.
&quot;gemini&quot; is the scheme, &quot;//&quot; is the beginning of hier-part or
relative-part, and &quot;:&quot; separates the scheme from hier-part.

I've previously called for clarification on this point. One might read
that last sentence as requests by suffix references are allowed,
(which is what you get when you omit &quot;<A HREF="gemini://">gemini://</A>&quot;) or that some
relative-ref are allowed (which is what you get if you literally omit
the scheme and scheme separator).

I'd prefer if the spec could just refer to an expected syntax as
defined in RFC 3986. This would reduce confusion significantly. Skip
all the hacks and allow only e.g. the URI syntax (which does not
include relative-ref) for requests and URI-reference syntax (which
includes URI and relative-ref) for links. Adopt the language of RFC
3986 to describe them.

Last I checked, if you connect to <A HREF="gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space">gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space</A> and
request &quot;gemini.circumlunar.space/&quot; you get an error. You may however
request &quot;//gemini.circumlunar.space/&quot; and get the appropriate 20
response. Should gemini.circumlunar.space be considered to be running a
canonical implementation of Gemini?
