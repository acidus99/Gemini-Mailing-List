Verbally conveying URLs and usernames is a situation I find myself in
at least monthly... even more often before COVID.
When both parties speak the same language, sure, it's more or less fine,
but trying to explain an address with a character the other party has no
idea how to input is an exercise in frustration.

</I>
Agreed. This can be handled *today* by clients with no change in the
protocol.

&gt;<i> 2. Read/follow links with bare URL: If the URL is non-ascii: more

</I>
Agreed. Again, this can be handled *today* by clients with no change to
the protocol.

&gt;<i> 3. Write links to URLs that I control: More inclusive and convenient to be

</I>&gt;<i> 4. Write links to URLs that I don't control: It'll be more

</I>
I'd actually say it's just *slighty* more convenient. In most cases
you'll be copying and pasting the URL. If the gemini community feels that a
breaking change that increases the complexity of implementing servers
*and* clients is worth it for this slight change in convenience... well,
like I mentioned earlier, that doesn't bode well for the future.

As for inclusivity/accessibility... I just don't buy it. Completely
non-technical people are going to be using tooling for writing gemtext
anyway - the rest are perfectly capable of percent-encoding if they
*really really* want to use non-ascii characters.

All that said, I'll make another attempt at leaving this discussion (and
the mailing list) again... hopefully a final decision will be made
soon ;)
