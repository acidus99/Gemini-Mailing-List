Yes, thanks. I've been pondering myself what is the best way to
facilitate discussions that span more than one phlog/gemlog. Apologies
if I end up hijacking this thread to do it.

</I>
This does mostly work in gopherspace, but there have been times I wanted
to write a reply (on my own phlog), but felt balked because I felt like
they wouldn't see the reply unless I was listed on one of the two phlog
aggregators that most people use, and I wasn't.

&gt;<i> In my experience the email thing works well, and lends Gopherspace a
</I>&gt;<i> very personal feel, which I enjoy.  That, too, might break down if email
</I>&gt;<i> address harvesting robots penetrate Geminispace in the future and people
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to put their address on their &quot;about&quot; page.
</I>
I should probably make my reply email more prominent on my gemlog posts.

But what I was thinking about was something more similar to
Pingbacks[1]. I'm not interested in comments on blogs; I'm more
interested in something like what we have going in gopher, but with a
system for notifying authors that they've been replied to on another
gemlog. It looks like the current specification for doing this kind of
thing on the web is Webmention[2], which comes from the indieweb
community. I haven't put in very much thought into how I actually want
it to work, but I probably need to start by reading the Webmention
documentation.
