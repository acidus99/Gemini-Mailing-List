I am actually extremely open to the idea of splitting the list into
several separate lists, as commonly seen in large software projects like
operating systems.  Something like:

* gemini-users: for everyday Gemini users without any special interest
  in the technical side of things.  Announcements of new capsules,
  projects like aggregators and &quot;gemrings&quot;, authorship conventions,
  advocacy/outreach, etc.  Maybe announcements of initial releases of
  new user-oriented software.  Probably the busiest list?
* gemini-dev: for people authoring Gemini software.  Discussion of
  technical best practices, etc.
* gemini-admin: for people running Gemini servers.  Do we actually need
  this?  Probably low traffic, for sharing e.g. IP addresses of
  misbehaving clients.
* gemini-spec: for spec finalisation.  Ideally low traffic, limited
  membership, guaranteed in advance to be permanently set read-only
  within a few months of creation.
* gemini-announce: very low traffic list only I can post to with
  important announcements.

How do people feel about this?  I don't know how the list hosts feel so
can't guarantee this is possible, but I'm very happy to make enquires if
there's broad support for this.  I for one think it's a good idea.  I
know multiple people who have unsubscribed from this list after heavy
early involvement because it's just become too much to follow.

Cheers,
