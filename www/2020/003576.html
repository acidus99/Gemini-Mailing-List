<PRE>First of all, lets not conflate a spec with law. The spec
doesn't have to follow law. A spec is a guideline, it doesn't
have to match law, and it doesn't have to be adhered to either.

Secondly, let's actually look at what the court ruled here, on the implied license front:
&gt;<i> consent to use the copyrighted work need not be manifested verbally and may be inferred based on silence where the copyright holder knows of the use and encourages it.
</I>
Notice the &quot;where the copyright holder knows of the use and encourages it.&quot;
That's not necessarily the case in this discussion. It was the case in that court case.
That court case literally doesn't apply here. Especially since Field explicitly added code
so that search engines would index *the URL* of the page. This is not the case in this discussion as the
absence of robots.txt would *not* be explicitly allowing search engines to index the URL of the page, and each
server that doesn't have a robots.txt would not &quot;know of the use and encourage it&quot;.

Finally, precedents can be challenged by the Supreme Court. For example, the current Supreme Court case of Google v. Oracle dismissed everything the district courts and the Circuits had to say, because the Supreme Court looks at things freshly.

</I>&gt;<i> Okay, but &quot;gemini users and what they think&quot; won't matter. The only place to seek relief is a court
