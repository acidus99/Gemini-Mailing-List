Lets not look at it this way, lets look at it for the way of what does
caching truly enable, I've discussed this many times, no one seemed to
address my concerns, if in-protocol caching mechanism exists, it opens
the window for serving complex document formats that are resource
heavy, see HTML pulling stylesheets and images for example, it is
discouraged to use anything other than gemtext for documents in Gemini.

In the case of serving media files like music, video, and even large
PDFs, these are downloaded to be saved on disk anyway, so caching
wouldn't be a concern.

The only convincing reasoning for caching is Waweic's use case using
Mallick's method, and even that doesn't introduce any new protocol
features.

&gt;<i> That would be a nice feature, but is it nice enough to warrant
</I>&gt;<i> breakage across the growing number of implementations? text/gemini
</I>&gt;<i> documents can display an estimated size for linked files, and a user

</I>&gt;<i> complete solution by any means, but worth considering as it is much
</I>&gt;<i> cheaper.
</I>
While to each their own, and implementations can behave the way they
desire, I'm against this feature as it breaks certain sites that are
slow to load, I'd have to refresh once again and get it to load fast if
I don't want it to timeout, what you could do instead is have in the
bottom (or top) status bar or any information indicator a display of
how much is downloaded of the requested file, the user then judges if
they want to stop or not by hitting a cancel button.
