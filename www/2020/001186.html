<PRE>It was thus said that the Great solderpunk once stated:

&gt;<i> The only hope is to

</I>
  I added the test for data: URIs for the lulz (it is, after all, a *client
torture* test), which the expectation that no one would really do anything
with it.  And the data itself is 'text/gamini' as a nice treat for anyone
that did anything with it.

  One way to think of data: is not to inline data, but as a pre-fetch of
data, but without the overhead of a second request.  Yes, it's silly, but it
is what it is.  Besides, as just a gut feeling, I think the majority (well
over 99%) of the links you'll find in the Geminisphere are:

	gemini:
	gopher:
	https:
	http:
	mailto:

  I have no numbers to back that up, but that feels right to me, and such
links as tel: or sip: will almost *never* show up (for the record, I haven't
come across tel: or sip: on the web in the wild [1]).

&gt;<i> But I really didn't want to just rely on politely asking people not to
</I>&gt;<i> do certain things, but to make it impossible or very difficult to do
</I>&gt;<i> them at the protocol level.  I know you can never *really* do that,
</I>&gt;<i> people can ignore RFCs and implement totally broken stuff and the
</I>&gt;<i> internet police don't come and arrest them.  But I had hoped we could
</I>&gt;<i> get really close to that ideal.
</I>
  Creativity is amplified by restrictions, and oh boy is Gemini restrictive. 
So it's not surprising to me that people are poking and proding at the edges
to see what's possible.  I never realized that music consisting of the same
note was a thing until this video:

	<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSuK_5zW2iM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSuK_5zW2iM</A>

or how about the restriction of using a single color for a painting?

	<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-pdyTFOvYw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-pdyTFOvYw</A>

  Years ago, a friend sent me an email of only 26 words.  It was a coherent
message *where every word was in alphabetical order!*  I replied with
another 26 words, with a coherent message, but in *reverse alphabetical
order!*

  I mention these as a way to explain the recent activity in Gemini, as more
peoples' creativity has been unleashed by the contraints of Gemini.

  And always keep in mind, a polite &quot;no&quot; is always a viable answer.

[1]	I do at work, but at work I deal with SIP, so tel: and sip: comes
	with that territory.
