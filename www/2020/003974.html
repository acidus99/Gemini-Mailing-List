This is not strictly a Web issue: it is a DNS issue and affects all
protocols, including FTP, email, Gopher, etc.

As a Schemer, I definitely do care about it.

It's a balancing act between the needs of software authors and the needs of
content authors.  If Gemini succeeds, the latter will be much more common.
I think that internationalized link lines (which will have to become part
of the definition of text/gemini) are very important to authors.  Whether
clients accept IRIs in the address bar (or equivalent) is up to the client
author.  And I very strongly feel that changing the Gemini *protocol* to
pass IRIs serves nobody and shouldn't even be considered.

Good.  As the saying is, if you want to know if there is antisemitism in a
particular place, ask the Jews who live there.

I now introduce Professor Smullyan, who will prove to you that either
he doesn't exist or you don't exist, but you won't know which.
