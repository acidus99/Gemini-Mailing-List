what feed reader is nowadays.

</I>I don't like this. One of the main points of gemini for me is
decentralization and that it is not commercial. Adding support for
something like medium would slowly make it only slightly better than the
web - requiring users to login after they read 3 articles, etc.

I think it would be cool if we had a pretty Android &amp; IOS app marketed
as a blogging/writing platform. On the first screen it would prompt the
user to select an instance where they want to register an account (in
fact creating an ssh account), then it would be simply normal gemini
client app. The homepage could be a feed reader, the user could write
gemini markup directly in the app or they could write it as WYSIWYG.

I think this way, it would be possible to get non-tech people use it.
