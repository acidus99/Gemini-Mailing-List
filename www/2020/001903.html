To the best of my knowledge, no.  I don't think anybody has written
anything supporting session resumption, either.

It's very true that the combination of TLS and
one-request-per-connection is a bad combination for latency (although,
for what it's worth, I still think the user experience is pretty
acceptable even now, and much better than the web).  As for &quot;how bad&quot;
this is, and whether or not it's a good motivation (as alluded to in
other threads) for dropping TLS, it should be noted that, today, we are
surely seeing almost the worst possible cases for this.  Nobody is using
stuff like 0-RTT data, nobody is using session resumption, and most
people are using Let's Encrypt certificate chains which are three certs
long, and each one uses big RSA keys.  We can and should try to do
better in this regard.

&gt;<i> Any thoughts on which requests can safely use it?  (For
</I>&gt;<i> example, would it be reasonable to allow early data for all requests
</I>&gt;<i> that don't use a client certificate?)
</I>
In combination with the idea I've proposed previously that any request
with non-reversible non-trivial consequences should require a client
certificate, that would seem, at first glance, a pretty sensible
response to the threat of replay attacks.

Regarding TLS session resumption, there is the issue to consider of
so-called &quot;prolongation attacks&quot;:

<A HREF="https://svs.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/publications/2018/2018-12-06-Sy-ACSAC-Tracking_Users_across_the_Web_via_TLS_Session_Resumption.pdf">https://svs.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/publications/2018/2018-12-06-Sy-ACSAC-Tracking_Users_across_the_Web_via_TLS_Session_Resumption.pdf</A>

whereby TLS session information which roundtrips from the server to
client and back can be used (as can *any* information which roundtrips
in this way) for tracking.  This could be mitigated easily with
client-side policies on maximum session duration, but would be something
for implementers to be wary of.

Cheers,
