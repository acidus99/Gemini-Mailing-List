It's true, and a good point, that stuff may be buffering up in kernel
space even when the client has only read a little bit of it.  If the
idea was to present a prompt to the user, I would agree this may be of
little use.  But if the client itself peeks at the first two bytes and
then immediately closes the connection, I would have thought that would
be quick enough to make a worthwhile impact.  But I admit I'm not too
sure of that.  Maybe actual real world testing would be in order...
