I was not aware that this was a common thing to do.
If it is, and it is desirable, then I agree that it should be a client
torture test. It could also be mentioned in the specification so that
client authors can be aware.

As a side-note, are clients expected to append a colon to the end of the
input prompt? I have seen some clients do that, and wasn't sure if that
was a standard thing.
