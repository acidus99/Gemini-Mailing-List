<PRE>It was thus said that the Great nervuri once stated:

  Okay, point taken.

  I threw the IP address into the almighty Google.  The third result (for
me, your results may vary as this is Google) was to this link:

	<A HREF="https://lists.sr.ht/~emersion/alps-dev/%3C20200625175005.52130-1-zdecook%40ccel.org%3E/raw">https://lists.sr.ht/~emersion/alps-dev/%3C20200625175005.52130-1-zdecook%40ccel.org%3E/raw</A>

which showed me that Zach DeCook sent a patch to the ALPS development list
originating from said IP address.  The domain of his email address,
ccel.org, did not show anything related to Gemini, but throwing his name
into the almighty Google brought me to his homepage:

	<A HREF="https://zachdecook.com/">https://zachdecook.com/</A>

where at the bottom, you can see the link to his Gemini site, which has the
IP address 107.5.198.24.

  Yes, that's a bit of work, but it was less than 5 minutes, and I'm not
even a state actor here.  Is that enough of a bar for you?
