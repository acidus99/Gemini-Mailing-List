I think there's still a long way for gemini clients to come before demanding the Future Inevitable Feature. Like, the more thought that goes into this, the less likely we'll run out of status codes.
One way a client could implement caching is by loading the cached version of a page, and telling the user when it was downloaded, next to a 'refresh' button. A gemini client could even offer a diff view between the current page and the cached copy. All of that *empowers the users* over the servers, and doesn't rely on adding anything to the spec.
A &quot;please don't cache&quot; response code would be (ab)used by servers who desire to track their users.
