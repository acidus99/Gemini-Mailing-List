<PRE>Hey everyone,

Solderpunk at some point mentioned a temporary spec freeze, unfreezing
for early 2021, then permanently finalizing the spec. I have no idea if
this is still the plan or not, but I still feel it would be a good idea
to discuss: what modifications would be made to the spec in an
&quot;unfrozen&quot; period, if any; what modifications would be made to the spec
in its permanent finalization stage; and how companion specs and the
like would be dealt with, both now and in the finalization stage.


Firstly, how spec changes should be approached in an unfrozen period, if
any of those pop up. We may be in one now, since Solderpunk updated the
spec to fix schemes? But at any rate, I believe most would agree that
the current state of debate is probably not the best in terms of
actually coming to an agreement. Not that you'll ever reach 100%
consensus, but most current debates seem pretty evenly divided which
isn't conductive to actually choosing a side to reflect in the spec. I'm
unsure how to remedy this, but I'm bringing it up.

On what changes should actually be made, in my opinion the only changes
that should be made at this point should be to fix glaring problems in
the spec. I guess that creates another problem, because people can't
even agree what a &quot;glaring problem&quot; is! Solderpunk's been pretty
reasonable, so I'll leave it up to them to actually decide what's a
problem and what's not, but it's a rule of thumb to say that things that
&quot;would be nice&quot; shouldn't be included at this point (I'm saying this as
someone who has a few would-be-nices of my own[a]). As a second rule of
thumb, I'd say no breaking changes, even if they do fix a problem in the
spec. Backwards compatibility is painful, but luckily we only have a
year and a half to deal with as opposed to the decades some projects
have to be compatible with, so hopefully it isn't as much of a hardship
as it possibly could've been.


Onto a permanent spec freeze, if such a thing would occur. I believe
making the spec totally immutable would be arrogant on our part, because
you can't pretend that it is 100% perfect. I'd say that no feature
changes, and few to no major changes in general should be made. I'd say
that there should only be three classes of changes in a finalized spec:
technological upgrades, clarifications, and error corrections.
Technological upgrades would be if a component of the stack has an
upgrade or a replacement, particularly when there's security involved.
To use TLS as an example, it would be removing TLSv2 support when TLSv3
reaches wide support. Clarifications would be just that, clarifications
of the spec in areas that are unclear or create ambiguity. Error
corrections would be fixing minor errors and edge cases that can be
fixed without breaking anything, and add no new features. This is
breaking so wouldn't count, but an example of error correction would be
the most recent spec change that adds a mandatory scheme to requests.


Finally, I'd like to address companion specs. Especially if the spec is
permanently finalized, there will be companion specs popping up all over
the place. This can be viewed as good, because it means that each spec
is nice and unix-y, doing only one thing each. This creates the problem
the web has though, where authors are expected to support an amorphous
and constantly changing group of specs and results in huge applications
that are impossible to maintain. Even if companion specs like Titan are
fine now, it leaves a huge opening for the web-ification of gemini in
the future WHEN (not if) FAANG-inspired malicious actors take an
interest in it. There are a few ways to address this, from the hardliner
approach of completely disallowing companions to the 100% inclusive
approach of creating a dedicated RFC listing. Obviously a middle ground
will have to be found, but a discussion on where exactly that may be is
warranted. You don't want to cut out useful things like titan, but you
also don't want to leave a huge extensibility window open.


A long rambling of my thoughts, but there's some discussion points (that
in hindsight should've been broken up into multiple emails) that IMO
should be addressed before any firm decisions are made regarding the
future of the spec.
