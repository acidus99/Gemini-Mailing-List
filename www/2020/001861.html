<PRE>First, thank you all for your answers.

@Felix Quei&#223;ner

&gt;<i> Yeah, definitely. It sounds like the perfect match for embedded devices,
</I>as it requires no encryption and no complex state machines.

I think also for hobbyists and education. As soon as &quot;what is a
socket&quot; has been explained, Mercury can be used as one of the first
examples of how it works.  Add TLS in the mix and suddenly it becomes
more difficult to grasp.

@defdefred

&gt;<i> Seems that the protocol specification should be separate from the text format protocol (true for gemini too).
</I>
Of course the request/response protocol and the text/gemini format are
distinct. But I think at the moment they are best together in the
&quot;Gemini Spec&quot; document.  It doesn't prevent anybody to serve
text/gemini pages over http... :-)

@William Casarin

&gt;<i> I don't see why there couldn't be another ecosystem around mercury. I
</I>picture clients eventually supporting a suite of protocols, such as
gopher, mercury and gemini all at once.

In my mind, it wouldn't be a different ecosystem -- exactly like there
is only one &quot;web ecosystem&quot;, with both http and https URLs.

As long as the spec specifies both the &quot;with TLS&quot; and &quot;without TLS
bits&quot;, and as long as most client/server authors agree to support
both, there shouldn't be any ecosystem split -- again, same as what
happened with http and https
