<PRE>Hi!

I think it's really valuable to *try* all kinds of things and
different approaches to see *what* fits well. IMHO we have only
scratched the surface of what is possible with the Gemini protocol
(and what makes for good UX).

To summarize what has been discussed here:
1. Filling in multiple values is not trivial with the input response type
2. One way is to generate a session id on the server. (This is
stateful, which has some downsides but avoids replay issues.)
3. Another way is to embed all the responses in the URL.

Some ideas that haven't been mentioned:

a. If you include all the fields at once, you could just ask for them
in one request. Eg. &quot;10 name;location;link;comment&quot; which the user is
smart enough to parse and respond with &quot;Hannu;;;This is cool!&quot;. Or for
a better UX, make the fields newline-separated (ie. %0A in the URL)
and have multiline-capable input fields in browsers. Note: this is
against a strict interpretation of the spec but hasn't been discussed
AFAIK.

b. Instead of having different links for different fields, you could
ask for the fields in succession (but this only works well for the
session id based approach). Eg. /guestbook/sign responds with &quot;30
/guestbook/sign/aF3d&quot;, then /guestbook/sign/aF3d responds with &quot;10
Name&quot;, /guestbook/sign/aF3d?Hannu with &quot;10 Location (optional)&quot;, then
&quot;10 Link (optional)&quot; and &quot;10 Comment&quot; in sequence, saving each query
string to the server-side session. After the final response either
save the comment or show the responses with a link to save.

I personally think the Gemini protocol (as it currently is) can be as
powerful as the UNIX command line (note: only CLI, not TUI). In fact,
you could serve a remote shell over Gemini. Of course we're all
spoiled by interactive software even in a terminal so Gemini feels
quite limited.
