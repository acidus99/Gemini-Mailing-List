&gt;<i> Hello Geminauts,

</I>&gt;<i> This is my first post here but I have been lurking for awhile.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The thread about archiving led me just now to read about the Right to be Forgotten for the first time. It&#8217;s not something that I&#8217;ve ever heard anyone talk about in Canada, didn&#8217;t realize it was an active controversy in Europe. It raises interesting questions - is it possible to take information off the internet? Is it effectively gone for most people when you remove it from Google? What is more important - the value of the public in knowing what happened, or the value to the individual in getting on with his life after making a mistake?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For Gemini protocol, I feel like if it becomes important enough to people, an archive is likely to be created whether we want it or not. There&#8217;s probably some value in the community itself proactively creating a sanctioned archive itself that respects creators&#8217; reasonable desires to have their content taken offline on demand.

Hello Everyone, 
the right to be forgotten is something we here in Germany are discussing for quite some time. 
There is a semigood wikipedia article about it here <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten</A>

Personally I think, if you put it up online visible to everyone, there is a chance, that someone will
take your content and save it. Either for himself or for others. You can not protect that other than
handing out passwords to people who want to read your content. But then it makes not much sense to put 
it up and online. Then you could also send it via email. 

I personally like the idea of an internet archive. Respecting the copyright. But if you give your copyright 
away by posting something unter a CC licencse or similiar, then you give away your content which could 
then be archived.
