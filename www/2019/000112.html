</I>
In #1 above is the idea that there would be no wrapping and any
text that went over the  width limit would be truncated?

I can see that being a bad user experience if someone's device
does not conform easily to the size that is chosen. It is also
annoying to enforce. A perfectly fine document would not be
readable because their lines go to 60 instead of 45? 

I am fine with a fixed width, but only if wrapping or reflowing
is available and declarable by the content author.

In #2 is reflowed what we are aiming for or is wrapped what we
are aiming for? Both terms have been used during the ongoing
conversation and I have lost track of which one people are
preferring and how each person defines them.

Example:

In this example I am writing a long line and
then a newline and a shorter line.


Reflow (ignores whitespace beyond single spaces):

In this example I am writing a long
line and then a newline and a
shorter line.

Wrap (recognizes whitespace and just wraps the long line):

In this example I am writing a long
line and
then a newline and a shorter line.

I am definitely still open to the idea of a simple markdown flavor,
which would potentially make some of this conversation moot. That
again ups the client complexity a good amount though so it would
have to be **very** simple.

Right? Nice and easy. Given that fixed content will likely be more rare
than wrapped or flowed content it seems like an elegant solution.
