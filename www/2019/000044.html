<PRE>It was thus said that the Great solderpunk once stated:
&gt;<i> &gt;   There's no reason for the user to generate a certificate and then provide
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a username/password when the certificate already has the username:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is kind of neat, but would require the interface interaction that
</I>&gt;<i> happens in response to a 61 to give the user the opportunity to specify
</I>&gt;<i> these details.  At best, this is an unnecessary bit of UI friction in
</I>&gt;<i> cases where it won't be used.  At worst, for very privacy-conscious
</I>&gt;<i> users, being asked to specify any kind of personal information at all to
</I>&gt;<i> include in something which is supposed to be an entirely ephemeral /
</I>&gt;<i> disposable / transient will feel like a red flag, I suspect.
</I>
  You're already asking for clients to generate a temporary certificate. 
Before going too down far this rabbit hole, why not make a few temporary
certificates and hitting:

	<A HREF="gemini://gemini.conman.org/private/">gemini://gemini.conman.org/private/</A>

  There's nothing there that generates a status of 10, but it is asking for
temporary certificates.  It's not even expecting any set information.  It
might be instructive to know what what is and isn't required for a
certificate.

&gt;<i> &gt;   Not much there, other than to ask about having second thoughs about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certificate only authentication?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, can you clarify?  Do you mean second thoughts about only having
</I>&gt;<i> certificates as a way to authenticate (i.e. are we sure we don't want
</I>&gt;<i> passwords as first-class citizens?).  Or do you mean second thoughts
</I>&gt;<i> about allowing authentication with only a certificate?  Why wouldn't we
</I>&gt;<i> want to allow that?
</I>
  I meant I had no thoughts about your question re: status code of 11.  My
question to you was, why have a usernames/password scheme when you have
certificates, which are a combination of username/password?
