<PRE>It was thus said that the Great James Tomasino once stated:
&gt;<i> I installed Jetforce on gopher.black tonight and immediately ran into a
</I>&gt;<i> very basic question. What is the _name_ of the default index file? 
</I>
  It depends upon the server I would guess.  I don't see why the name of an
index file would be a standard.

&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> looked through the spec (granted not closely) and didn't see it defined.
</I>&gt;<i> In the end I read through Michael's source for Jetforce and found that
</I>&gt;<i> he's using &quot;.gemini&quot; to override the default file listing and serve an
</I>&gt;<i> index gemini file.
</I>
  And I use a file called 'index.gemini', modelled after Apache's
'index.html' file (the name of which is configurable so it doesn't even have
to be that).

&gt;<i> Is that standard? Is there a standard? That seems like a fairly basic
</I>&gt;<i> thing we might want to include. It seems small now, but if a Gemini
</I>&gt;<i> server were to grow large and wanted to change server software that
</I>&gt;<i> could become a big barrier.
</I>
  It didn't seem to be a problem with having .htm and .html files.  On my
sever, if a directory contains an index.gemini, it will be served, otherwise
a default page will be constructed.  Addtionally, if a file has an extension
of &quot;.gemini&quot; it will be served up with a MIME type of &quot;text/gemini&quot;.  But
that's on my server.  Others may vary.

  -spc (For instance, I've seen &quot;.gmi&quot; used as an extension)
